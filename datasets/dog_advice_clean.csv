0,DogAdvice,My friend‚Äôs roommate is a neglectful pet owner. What should I do?,"My friend (m) and her roommate (p) have both recently adopted one dog and one cat each. To my knowledge neither have owned a dog before. 
P adopted a 3 year old and fully untrained pit a couple of months ago. He is aggressive and attacks other dogs (he has attacked me and my service dog.) 
2 weeks ago, M picked up an emaciated hound off the side of the road (40+ lbs under weight, with hook and ring worms and an ear infection.) 
I have been informed that my service dog is no longer welcome, and M‚Äôs dog has to be locked into her room and escorted to the back yard occasionally but has no access anywhere else. This is because P‚Äôs dog attacks her. 
To make it worse, P picked up a kitten (the size of the palm of my hand) out of a parking garage and brought it home. She left it in a crate alone with no litter box, (to my knowledge no food) and with no attention for 6+ hours. As far as I am aware she is left crated and alone for hours on end and nobody ever interacts with her because she ‚Äúwon‚Äôt stop pissing and shitting all over us‚Äù 

I‚Äôm legitimately concerned and don‚Äôt know who to contact. I don‚Äôt want to cause any harm to that dog and could never be responsible for his death, but he has a track record of biting and attacking my service dog and I as well as an emaciated dying dog. I‚Äôm terrified that he is going to disfigure or kill a human or another animal, she refuses to train him, and nobody will talk to her about it. I don‚Äôt want him to be put down but he‚Äôs a danger to himself and others.",junkyjunkjunktrash,2022-12-02,06:12:43,2022,12,2,6,12,Friday

0,DogAdvice,Gum color?,"Hello!

Probably a dumb question but after a health scare I've been overly worried about my dog and I'm probably driving her poor vet nuts lol. Does this look like a normal gum color? 

A little background for insight, A couple weeks ago she collapsed and the vet found nothing wrong with her, thought it was just a freak occurrence. Then a few days later we took her in for a teeth cleaning (she had a couple chipped teeth too) and instead they canceled it last second because they were concerned about her heart/pale gums/combined with the collapse from a few days before. They kept her for the day and observed her/did a ton of tests (blood work, and a ultrasound on heart as well as her stomach) and found nothing wrong. Her heart was slightly enlarged but they said it was not DCM just that it was bigger and matched her frame. She's a stocky bully mix.

Shes been herself for the most part. Still super food motivated, still wants to play all the time, and happily goes on walks, but she does seem more lethargic and lip smacks a TON. She is a senior, will be 11 in February. I realize may just be her getting older, but I just wanted to see what other people thought. 

I take her to the Vet all the time so that's not a worry, I just don't want to waste their time if this is a normal color and I'm just paranoid lol

0,DogAdvice,Senior Dog Advice,"Hi friends! This is Nacho. He will be 17 this winter, and I was wondering if anybody has had a similar situation to what we've been experiencing lately. 

Good news first, I just brought nacho to the vet last week for his annual checkup, and he's in great shape. All the tests came back good, and he's a perfectly healthy pup, for his age. The bad news, Nacho has had a hard time holding his bowel movements over the past 7-10 months or so. It started off with a bomb every few days, but now it's happening every day, 2-3 times a day. 

He's always had a consistent diet. 1/3 a cup of kibble twice a day. 1 glucosamine treats, and small treats throughout the day. But lately it feels like he's got more coming out than he has going in. His back legs and hips look kind of funny when he stands up. His tail also really doesn't move much anymore, which the vet said was normal. They also said it's likely that he's losing feeling back there. I was curious of anybody here has had a similar situation, and maybe had some suggestions on what may create less bulk in his system for treats? I don't want to change his diet completely, but I'm curious if any small adjustments may help. We go out on a lot of walks. He will do his business, come in and do it again. 

Other than that, he's a good boy. He was always so good about going out, so this has taken me by surprise.  Any suggestions would be great! Thank you!

0,DogAdvice,body language with ears,"Hey y'all,

So this is my dog here, his name is Woody and he's an 18 month old mutt- lab, pit bull, cattle dog, german shepard, rotweiller (with a high wolf content) for reference. I found him stranded on the road when he was 2 weeks old and i've been raising him ever since. 

Anyway, I've never seen a dog more expressive than he is. He's got eyebrows and his face alone has hundreds of expressions. I like to think that I know what most of them mean, but the one that confuses me most is when he squints his eyes and puts his ears back. I've read that it's a sign of negative emotions, but he only really does it when he's lounging around the house. Does anyone with some expertise in dog body language know what this means? I just hope that it doesn't mean he is anxious, fearful, or sad. It looks hysterical when he does it but I'd love to know what's going on in his head when he makes this expression.

0,DogAdvice,Special needs puppy,So I have a puppy that is a runt and sadly was the only one to survive out of the litter. The reason for that was due to the family who housed the dog and puppies didn't put their other dogs outside when they left which caused a fight in the whelping box. So Lobo (my puppy) has trauma and had gotten a puncture in her brain which has caused her to be wobbly. The vet said she'll hopefully grow out of it. I haven't seen any improvement and have been getting kinda worried. I'll have to get her diapers soon due to not being able to potty train her. I also plan on making her a wheelchair soon.

0,DogAdvice,Recommendations for dogs with weakening back end,"Luna, my 10 year old shepherd mix, lost the genetic lottery. She has had so many health issues since day one of adopting her 6 years ago, that I should have expected the most recent diagnosis.

0,DogAdvice,Question about counter conditioning and desensitization for nail clipping,"Our rescue has generalized anxiety and has always been nervous around grooming/handling of any kind since we got him. We made an appointment with a vet behaviorist who gave us specific instructions on how to proceed with counter conditioning and desensitizing him to nail clipping. The first step was just to leave the nail clippers out and have high value treats around it. We‚Äôve done that for about 2 weeks now. He‚Äôs a very nervous dog so we are taking it real slow with him. Now that he doesn‚Äôt show signs of nervousness around the clippers we are up to the second step now. She told us to leave the nail clippers out and wait for him to approach it and to paw at it. This is where we are having issues. He doesn‚Äôt know how to paw at it. He‚Äôs sniffed it and he‚Äôs tried chewing on it!We‚Äôve tried waiting for the closest behavior to him pawing at it, i.e. lifting his paw but that‚Äôs not happening and the longer we wait the more frustrated he becomes which seems counterintuitive to building a positive association to the nail clippers. We‚Äôve always had trouble with teaching him to offer his paw even without the nail clippers, so teaching that is another hurdle. I‚Äôve read that you can just show the nail clippers in your hand and give him a treat straight after then take the nail clippers away then show it again and give a treat but the vet behaviorist emphasized ‚Äònever walk over to him with the nail clippers in my hand until he approaches the nail clippers on his own and paws at it.‚Äô I‚Äôm so confused on how to proceed! I‚Äôd ask the vet behaviorist but I can‚Äôt afford another session.

Anyone else have or had a nervous dog who didn‚Äôt like their nails clipped also? Should I never approach my dog with the nail clippers even if just holding it up and pairing it with a delicious treat? I‚Äôd really appreciate some advice!

0,DogAdvice,Sleep deprived dog owner looking for advice.,"I have had my dog since he was a year old and he is now 8 years old. Recently he has started waking me up in the middle of the night and I‚Äôm not really sure why. He doesn‚Äôt do this when my boyfriend stays the night but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs relevant or not. 

Things I‚Äôve tried:

1. I‚Äôve tried taking him outside to the bathroom later (10pm) since I wake up for work at 6am it isn‚Äôt too long of a wait for him to go out to the bathroom again. 

2. I‚Äôve make sure he has plenty water in his water bowl before I go to bed.

3. I have cracked my bedroom door open incase he wants to go explore while I‚Äôm sleeping but he still stays in my room. 

What the behavior looks like when he wakes me up:

1. He will stare at me and breathe heavily at first. (Which usually wakes me up because that is his normal sign for ‚ÄúI need to go to the bathroom mom‚Äù.) When I have taken him out to the bathroom he pees a bit but then immediately wants to go back inside and continues to wake me up. 

2. If the first attempt doesn‚Äôt wake me up then he will proceed to jump on my bed with both front paws until I wake up. 

3. He only starts trying to wake me up between the hours of 3am until 6am(when I wake up for work)

Here‚Äôs some extra info in case it‚Äôs helpful:

Breed: Husky 

Health: Everything‚Äôs normal. I take him for regular vet check ups and visits. 

Feeding times: 6am and 5pm. (Feeding schedule my vet recommended) 

Any other questions just ask! 

TLDR; 

My husky keeps waking me up at between the hours of 3am-6am for no obvious reason. Nothing I have tried has fixed the issue.",fluffbal,2022-12-01,22:31:37,2022,12,1,22,31,Thursday
0,DogAdvice,Neighbors dog in yard?,"We have a large backyard that is not fenced in, but is lined with cedars and other trees and bushes. It's relatively closed off but has a few entry points. 

My dog is leash reactive and doesn't like all dogs and has on occasion (never seriously hurt) has been aggressive towards other dogs. We often throw the ball in the back yard as it's a safer choice than an offleash/dog friendly park etc  

3 doors down the home owners allow their dog to roam free. We do live on a quiet road with our backyards leading into a forest, but I have seen their dog in our yard and walking down the street. He is super friendly but kind of skittish.

This morning their dog came into the backyard and fortunately we had a good meeting with him and no tension or aggression and all was well.

Do you think that given my dogs unpredictable behavior I should not have him off leash in our yard, or if someone else's dog shows up and the situation goes differently that it's less my responsibility for any altercations between dogs?

I obviously don't want any harm to come to any dog and I understand it's my puppers behavior so I'll do what I can to avoid an altercation but just wanted to see what you all think/suggest!

0,DogAdvice,Please help ease my mind while I wait to hear from vet,"Last night we found a lump below our dog's jaw (4 y/o neutered male, pit mix). It feels movable, and we don't think it feels extremely firm, but have really no sense of ""firm"" or ""soft"" to compare it to. We do routinely check for lumps, and he loves his face/neck scratched, so I don't think we missed this growth; it feels like new growth. With that said, nothing about him feels different in terms of appetite, energy (he's very high energy), playing, weight gain/loss, drinking, pee/poop, etc. When we touch it or squeeze it from either the outside or inside of his mouth, it doesn't appear to cause him any discomfort. But, if it's a new lump, maybe none of these side effects have had time to show themselves yet.

I have a call into the vet to see if he can be seen ASAP, so please don't mistake this as seeking medical advice from Reddit instead of going to the vet.

0,DogAdvice,Keeping hyper dog calm during heart worm treatment,"I rescued a 1 year old male pitbull/husky mix from my local shelter about 7 months ago and he just came back positive for heart worm 2 weeks ago. I know that one of the main points for treatment is keeping your dog calm, which I also knew would be a challenge as he is extremely high energy. 
We had a good routine where I would walk him for about 1 1/2 hours each day and play with him for around 30-45 minutes inside which would leave him calm when we weren‚Äôt exercising or if I needed to do schoolwork. As of right now he is on doxy so I still have some lenience when it comes to his exercise so I have been taking him on 15-20 minute sniff walks (it‚Äôs still around 70 degrees where I live and I don‚Äôt want to stress him too much) and keeping him engaged with interactive toys while inside. This has proven to not be enough. 
He is professionally trained and was doing amazing but he has started to bark at me, mouth, and run/pull on his leash out of frustration. This is a daily occurrence and none of the training that he went through seems to help; I know that he is just trying to release lent up energy but it has gotten to the point where nothing I can do has calmed him. 
He gets around a double dose of calming treats per day (safe according to labeling and ingredients in the treats) and I even bought a pheromone diffuser which I knew would be a long shot. The main thing I haven‚Äôt done is get him prescribed medication. He has a prescription for gaba but it doesn‚Äôt really do anything for him and the next step would be traz but I wanted to avoid that because of how young he is and I didn‚Äôt want to alter his brain chemistry to rely on the effects before he is done developing (I am a pre-vet major so I have learned about how prolonged use of medications can result in reliance for production of certain chemicals in the brain). I wanted to try to adjust him to spending more time in his crate for when he starts his injections in January but he will bark and whine and my apartment complex has a noise policy where any excessive loud noises could get me evicted. I don‚Äôt have the money to board him with his vet for his treatment and I wanted to keep him in familiar surroundings so he doesn‚Äôt freak out too much. Is there anything else I could try or is the situation at the point where I need to get him a prescription to keep him from becoming too hyper?",Cgoode43,2022-12-01,19:39:09,2022,12,1,19,39,Thursday

0,DogAdvice,I really need help with my scared/aggressive dog,"My dog is a 5 year old buch√≥n frise and we‚Äôve had him for almost 6 years now. He has an extremely hard time around people and the only people he is comfortable around is me and the rest of my family. My parents recently had 2 more kids and my dog can‚Äôt handle them. I‚Äôve tried to keep him away from the kids and isolate him but I‚Äôm scared that in the future one of the kids will do something to upset him and he‚Äôll hurt them. I was thinking of giving him to an older more chill couple, but at his age and with the fact that he‚Äôs made zero progression in connecting with others, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs possible. My second option is a no-kill shelter where they can help him better then I can and so he can be interactive with other dogs. I love my dog so much and any time I think about this it makes me wanna cry but I have to think about his well-being and most importantly my family‚Äôs well-being. Is this my best option?

0,DogAdvice,Dog randomly started whimpering in crate,"My dog is 4yo and she has always been great in her crate, walks to it when I bring her to the room. Recently‚Ä¶ about a week and a half, she started whimpering him her crate. Generally it starts around 2-3am and has gotten earlier as time goes on. I can also hear her panting. I do have a vet visit scheduled for 12/9, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs medical. She is eating and drinking fine, and goes out in the yard and enjoys a walk. Urinating and having normal bowl movements. Her crate is next ti my other dog who seems unbothered by the whining and snores through it. 

I gave her a calming chew tonight and she started even earlier with the whines! 

I‚Äôm a very light and anxious sleeper so I cannot sleep and then I get worried something is wrong (I have bad anxiety and pet loss trauma). I know the vet will help put me at ease but I‚Äôm wondering if this is just behavior. She started this year with thunder storms (didn‚Äôt have an issue for 3 years and not she is throwing fits over storms). 

Stressors for anxiety that could be related.
1. 11/11-11/14 I was in Arizona and not with her
2. On 11/17-11/19 my brother brought his two dogs over and one was very anxious and loud (husky loud) he also wouldn‚Äôt stop sleeping in my bed where my two dogs are crated 

The whimpering stared 11/20 evening maybe 11/21. So I feel it‚Äôs all related. 

She is a Husky/Pomeranian mix (pomsky). No known heath issues apart from a luxtating patella. She is 22-23 pounds. Her crate is 24 by 36 inches. She can freely stretch and turn around in crate. I have not recently moved or washed it.

Just seeing if waiting till 12/9 is a bad idea or if it is truely behavioral and I have to ride it out. 

I work from home so I can re crate train her if needed and have her spend time in crate when I‚Äôm home. I just need to sleep üòÖ",ankangail1991,2022-12-01,12:46:23,2022,12,1,12,46,Thursday

0,DogAdvice,Dog Attack Advice,"Hi there, my dog was today on the receiving end of an attack by two large dogs. My dog is a 6 month old Brittany-poodle mix and she has been the most social, and playful dog I've seen (of course I'm biased). She loves the dog park.

Today while walking her, she was attacked and chased by two large dogs, a standard poodle, and a huge new foundland sized dog. The latter dog is known to be aggressive and every dog owner I talked to after the incident has had issues with it, even on the same day as the attack on my dog.

Now, my dog is a lot smaller, just over 10kg. Luckily she was fast enough to escape any physical harm, however she got such a fright she ran over 100m and across a road.

When I got to her I calmed her down and gave her water and re-assurance. I wanted to bring back into the park  so that she could try and put it out of her mind and have some good experiences with other dogs. I didn't force her to go back in but she seemed ok. Of course she was a little bit skittish and frightened of other dogs initially, but then she slowly came back to some semblance of her usual self although still a little shaken.

On her second walk of the day however things were not so good. By this time it was dark and the area is a kind of suburban area next to a busy road. She seemed to react negatively to stimulus like noise and dogs barking in other houses, lights being switched on and off, and that sort of thing. I had to cut the walk short because she didn't want to go further.

My question is for anyone who has had a similar experience. 

How do I go about giving my dog her confidence back? 
Is there any advice going forward with regards to reintroducing her to other dogs?",BigFinish26,2022-12-01,09:09:57,2022,12,1,9,9,Thursday
0,DogAdvice,Dog just goes wild when up the back of the yard,"It's like some switch just flicks in his head and he can't settle down. I'm not sure if it's somehow a conditioned thing where he associates the location with rough play or if it's because ut is a steep hill so when you are trying to walk back down your stress levels go up because you are worried about falling and maybe he senses that. He does play outside with my dog and they get rough so maybe he thinks that's his wrestling ring?

This is my mother's dog and he doesn't get walked enough so he gets these random bursts of energy and frustration and he no longer listens to you. She has been taking him to a more aversive focused training group and thinks you are supposed to get harsh with the dog to make him settle down. It seems to only make him get even rougher like when a teen is being yelled at and they snap back and retaliate instead of ""submitting"". I am now covered in bruises while trying to get back down the hill without tumbling over as he goes for your arms (I also didn't have any toys or nearby sticks or anything to trade my arms for as I wasn't expecting him to be outside and someone else must have let him out). I don't want to use harsh methods like grabbing his face and collar or pushing him to the ground like my parents are pressuring me to do. It's hard to remain calm with the bruising though and the precarious situation. 

Any ideas on what it is that gets him all revved up as soon as he sees someone trying to walk back down a hill?",DudeOrDog,2022-12-01,09:04:06,2022,12,1,9,4,Thursday

0,DogAdvice,Upset Stomach: When To Call the Vet?,"My dog (4 yrs old, spayed female, shepherd mix \~60 lbs) ate a smoked femur bone from Chewy last night. A few hours after chewing on the bone, she vomited up her dry food (white, foamy with undigested kibble), but had no other incidents. Similarly, I didn't notice any pieces of bone in her vomit.

She has eaten this type of smoked bone in the past with no issues. I keep an eye on her when she has them, but she went through this one really quickly. These are a very occasional treat (one every few months at most---she had one last night because there was a bad winter storm, and we couldn't get out for our normal walk).

This morning, she had a normal bowel movement and drank some water. She vomited a small amount of yellow bile and made sounds similar to a reverse sneeze, which subsided. I gave her a small amount of kibble (just a few pieces), and the food stayed down. \~45ish minutes later, she vomited a smaller amount of bile.

We went for a short walk, and she got a small (1/3 normal) portion of her kibble roughly 30 min ago. So far, she seems to be tolerating it alright. She burped a little, but hasn't vomited. I'm realizing in retrospect that I likely should have withheld food for 24 hrs, and then introduced a bland diet of rice and boiled chicken breast.

Things (so far) seem to be trending in a positive direction. She seems 75-85% ""like herself."" I'll be looking out for any issues with bowel movements over the next day or so, and will also contact the vet if the vomiting resumes. However, is there anything else I should be on the lookout for?

0,DogAdvice,Dog has been sick with very little appetite or thirst,"Hi, it‚Äôs my first post here but I‚Äôm just looking for some advice on what to do for my sick dog. She‚Äôs a Shiba Inu just over a year old, and she‚Äôs always been very energetic, friendly, and loud. But for the 1.5 weeks, she‚Äôs been extremely lethargic and refuses food and water when offered. She seems very nauseous most of the time and stands around or paces because she can‚Äôt seem to get comfortable. We took her to a handful of vets and none could find anything definitively wrong with her even after 4 X-rays, full blood tests, an abdominal ultrasound, etc. She even did 2 overnight stays (non-consecutive) at the vet and she would come home from the vet and act like she was at least a little better for a couple hours and then get really weak and nauseous again. This happened after both overnight stays. In the end, all they could really tell us is that she probably ingested something that she shouldn‚Äôt have and it caused a case of gastroenteritis. After spending nearly $4000 on vet visits, I‚Äôm very hesitant to take her in again just for them to not find anything and give me a nausea medication that doesn‚Äôt work. For the past couple of days since the vet, we have been feeding her canned green tripe which is supposed to help her digestion, but she will only eat it when she is held by one person and spoon fed by another. Other than this, she has no interest in eating or drinking. For hydration, we started making her drink water from a big syringe using the same method, though she seems to hate it. She‚Äôs still spending her days looking very sad and in pain, laying in secluded spots around the house and not moving most of the time. I‚Äôm not sure what other options are open to me at this point. My current approach is simply trying to keep her alive by making her eat and drink until she hopefully recovers from whatever this is.",dumbplumb56,2022-12-01,02:10:03,2022,12,1,2,10,Thursday

0,DogAdvice,Natural remedies/ingredients to help strengthen lungs after choking incident? Or recommendations,"Hello, my puppy (nearly 6 months old red lab) it seems recently when eating treats during a walk one went down the wrong way. The vet cannot find anything in her lungs or around the area but it seems her breathing has changed since the incident on Saturday. 

Sometimes on walks when she pulls against her body harness it sounds like she is choking (doesn't stop her from pulling especially if there is another dog tho of course!) 

The vet suggests (and has given us medication) that if something did go down the wrong hole that now the area is just sore. 

What I would like to know is if anyone recommends any natural remedies such as herbs or vegetables that could be given to her to help her lungs? If that's even a thing. Or soothe her insides lol

0,DogAdvice,How to help my dog who has paw/nail anxiety?,"We got my dog from a rescue back in 2018 when he was a few months old.  He's a chihuahua, chow chow, basset hound, and Plott hound mix.  The rescue workers said the person who brought him and his siblings in found them in a box on the side of the road.  He has always been anxious about big loud trucks, and anyone or anything trying to touch around his paws.  He's quite a bit better about the loud trucks (except garbage day lol) but still really won't let anyone touch his feet unless he's tired or in a really good mood.

He has to be sedated to have his nails trimmed, but this morning he wouldn't even go near my car or let me pick him up to put him in.

So basically my question is - what is the best way to go about earning his trust when it comes to letting people touch his paws and trim his nails?

Since the puppy was introduced a year ago the older male dog has been extremely agitated and has attacked the other two dogs and now bit my face last night. I‚Äôm okay but have a couple butterflies and will be sporting black eyes for a bit. It has progressed to the point the older dog starts growling if the younger dog even enters a room with him.

I‚Äôve raised, trained and been around dogs my whole life and have never been bit that aggressively. It‚Äôs partially my fault for humanizing the dog and leaning in when he was upset asking him to calm down gently while petting him. I‚Äôll obviously need to be setting better boundaries moving forward.

That being said, there has been a pretty extreme personality shift and a pattern of aggressive behavior. They‚Äôre planning to neuter the younger dog in a few weeks, Id imagine that will help but not fix the problem considering they‚Äôve been ignoring the issues for a year.

Does anyone know any good training or behavior reinforcement for a situation like this? He‚Äôs a great dog but his behavior has spun out of control at this point.

However, they didn't warn me what to expect such as how this will progress, will this be something she may need euthanised for, how much time we may have etc.

I'm looking for other people's experiences with this condition so I can prepare myself.   

She has been off her food for almost a week, which is why she was at the vets. She started eating bland human foods such as boiled chicken, rice and plain pasta but she won't touch dog food anymore. She's been on the same food for 7 years and is highly food motivated usually. She then developed bloody diarrhea so the vet gave some injections and a probiotic paste for her. The vet diagnosed gastroenteritis.

The reason I even mention her stomach issues is because she acts very confused when presented with her food. However we have noticed that once it starts getting dark, she gets really confused and restless like she doesn't know where she is. It's this information that made the vet diagnose dementia and I do agree.  

 
I've never had any dog develop dementia before so I'm not sure what to expect. She's also the oldest dog I've had, my previous dogs only made it to 11 and 12 and they never lost their mental capacity, instead cancer got them.

I know with her age, she's not likely to live many years more but I want her to be comfortable as possible. Is dementia something that can require a dog to be PTS? How fast does this typically progress? Will she forget her people?

I've had her since she was around 5 months old so I love her to bits. If she does require euthanasia, that decision will be made for her. As difficult as it is, her needs and wellbeing come first. I just want to know what I need to brace myself for.

If you made it this far, thank you for reading! I'm just a worried dog mum that's looking for real people's experiences and knowledge, rather than googling and having contradicting information, for what I can expect in the near future. Reddit may not be the best place but I figure at least one other person must have been through this before!",Jbbrowneyedgirl,2022-11-30,18:14:17,2022,11,30,18,14,Wednesday
0,DogAdvice,Middle of the night potty advice needed,"Hi all! Over the summer, we had family watch our dog, Hazel, while we were on vacation. She is a 3Y Australian Cattle and Pitty mix. We‚Äôve had her since she was 4M. After returning from our week long trip, Hazel began walking us up in the middle of the night whining to go to the bathroom. At first, we were concerned because she had never done this before and it was happening nearly every night. When I explained what was going on to the family member who watched her and that we were thinking of taking her to the vet, it came to light that during that week, they were letting Hazel out before they went to bed‚Ä¶.at like 2-3AM. Normally, she would go to bed with me around 9:30PM and always let her out before bed. Several months later, we are still having this problem. It no longer happens every night, maybe 2-3 nights in a row and then she‚Äôll go a couple weeks totally fine.

I don‚Äôt want to continuing enforcing this behavior, but also don‚Äôt want to reprimand for asking to go to outside. We have tried ignoring her, but she‚Äôs a very persistent dog and has escalated to barking if she doesn‚Äôt get her way. All very annoying in the middle of the night.

0,DogAdvice,Dog with IBD Flareup: Cramping and Pain? Help?,"My dog has a vet appointment tomorrow and he‚Äôs been given metronidazole and probiotic while we wait for the appointment. He‚Äôs also on a rice and lean beef diet (can‚Äôt do chicken/gluten because IBD).

After 24hrs on the metronidazole, he started getting abdominal cramping. He‚Äôs been doing a lot of restless pacing, hunching his back, and stretching out his back legs, which indicates to me that he‚Äôs got some abdominal pain. His diarrhea has not slowed down on beef and rice. I‚Äôm sure he also has some hemorrhoids since he has fresh blood in his poops. 

He‚Äôs had a few episodes of IBD that I can usually pin point the cause of. This current flare up was caused by a *single* blueberry. Previously, a few blueberries (3-4) were well tolerated but he suddenly started having diarrhea after a little break from them. After his diagnosis last year, I‚Äôve been very careful about his treats and diet.

Last long term flare was relieved, I think, mostly by omeprazole. It seemed to help reduce the stomach acid so it didn‚Äôt irritate his GI tract. I‚Äôll probably ask the vet about starting this again tomorrow. 

He seems very uncomfortable and I feel so bad. He keeps coming to me and leaning on me, which is a huge indication of pain. I‚Äôm afraid to give him anything so maybe a heating pad would help? Does anyone else have any tricks? Is there anything I can do in the mean time to ease his pain?",GlitteryCaterpillar,2022-11-30,13:55:27,2022,11,30,13,55,Wednesday

0,DogAdvice,Agressive 1 year old labrador. Help,"

Hello all, I have a golden labrador who recently turned 1. He is becoming hyper aggressive recently, four incidents in a month. All 4 incidents were sudden and we are having hard time understanding what's triggering this behaviour. He has become defensive towards his food in the last month. The incidents where he bit me and my sister lasted less than a minute but caused enough damage. And he acts completely normal immediately after. 
He is well trained, super smart and friendly at other times.
We take him for half an hour walks twice a day, playtime for more than three hours in a day. 
We consulted various vets and all are suggesting different solutions - neutering, canine teeth filing, anxiety meds, stopping treats completely. Unfortunately we don't have any animal behaviourist around. 
We absolutely don't want to give him up but I have to go away for few months for work and I don't feel my mother will be safe with him alone. 
Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.",nepemolo,2022-11-30,12:38:40,2022,11,30,12,38,Wednesday

0,DogAdvice,Year old Dachsund uses the bathroom inside after doing it outside first.,"Basically the title.

I have a just over a year old short-haired dachshund that continuously does both number 1 and 2 outside. After being inside for a while (like 15 minutes) we will end up noticing he goes again without any indication (both 1 and 2 multiple times). It is a significant amount both inside and outside.

He is kenneled (along with his sister) during the day while my wife and I are at work and we take him and his older sister (2yr long haired dachshund) out before and after work. Just like her, he gives indication that he needs to go outside, but we only see a problem with him going inside without indication afterwards. Both are fixed.

0,DogAdvice,Cooper - 3rd Time Rehomed,"We have had Cooper since July. He has been in 3 homes and he is 3 years old. He is a Yorkshire terrier crossed with a Schnauzer by my guess. He comes with a handful of behavioral and health issues. All minor and will not result in him being rehomed AGAIN. My family stand by our wildly different dogs especially if they come with some struggles. Nonetheless, we never seem to have a repeat of a dog type, so every dog is a learning experience. 

Cooper's behavioral/health issues are:

1) A lot of unnecessary barking when we head to the door for a walk, he sees a person, he is outside, there is a noise, something creates a shadow, etc. We don't know how to stop it beyond pushing him to lay down or having 5 minutes of kennel time-out. (He is not made to sleep/stay in the kennel, with the exception of if we are going to go out for more than 2 hours and he hasn't gone to the restroom.

2) Not fully house trained. He is partly marking things and partly pooping indoors if we aren't fast enough to let him out. He scratches to be him out. Sometimes, I don't think he asks but just tries to be stealthy. I have read this may be an anxiety thing, he has plenty of toys, another dog, and 3 human roommates. 

3) His feet. First, he is always scratching. Allergy pills seemed to help some but not always. He chews his feet and maybe nails a lot. Trying to cover them results in getting growled at. Sometime he will just yelp and chase his back foot. At least 3 times he has cut his back foot while scratching his face, resulting in bleeding. He has webbed toes so my running theory is he is catching that on his teeth.

0,DogAdvice,What age should I expect my 2 month old goldie to start playing nice?,"  I have a 2 year old unsocialized but we'll tempered and behaved Bichon. She doesn't know how to correct my 2 mo old field golden but is instinctually patient with her. 


The problem I'm currently having is my Bichon getting nipped a lot. I mean, it's really biting and I know it hurts. I've been watching videos about body language and Bichon isn't afraid of Golden or doesn't feel cornered. She also plays nice and respectfully, which is surprising since I don't know where she learned that from. 

So my Bichon isn't agitating or scaring golden. I think a combination of prey drive and testing her authority in the household is playing a roll but ultimately she is just a puppy.


I don't really know what to do since my Bichon can't correct Golden. I separate them when Bichon gets bitten and let them try again but they really can't play for longer than 5 minutes with Golden pulling her bullshit again. 

I don't want to *keep* them separated because everything I've read tells me that this is a crucial age for Golden to familiarize with her home and family. 

But I also feel like bad habits could be starting to form and I may need help of a trainer. 



The thing is that she isn't fully vaccinated and some YT trainers think she is too young to really learn anything serious right now.


So when do you think I should expect my Golden to show some improvement in this area?

0,DogAdvice,Dog is ‚ÄúMouthy‚Äù When Playing,"I am at my wits‚Äô end with my sweet dog who gets very ‚Äúmouthy‚Äù when playing. She does things like grab my clothes (and has ripped them) and have her mouth open when running into people (not *exactly* biting, but it still hurts). I‚Äôve started avoiding playing with her, which likely makes the problem worse because she has extra energy. 

We mainly play by running around, so I‚Äôm wondering if I need to change what play looks like (fetch maybe?). I‚Äôm also wondering if it would be a good idea to muzzle her while playing until we find a way to play without her getting over stimulated. That feels extreme, but I‚Äôm struggling to make any headway here. Any advice is appreciated. 

Some background: She showed up about 9 months ago as a stray, so I know nothing about her background, but suspect she was mistreated and abandoned. The vet said she was about a year old at the time, so almost two now. She looks like a Dutch Shepard and is 50 lbs. She‚Äôs had basic training, but we haven‚Äôt mastered doing the skills while she‚Äôs excited. She‚Äôs very anxious, but loving and playful and gentle except when excited.  This is my first dog other than farm dogs we had when I was a kid, so my newness to this whole thing probably doesn‚Äôt help the situation!

Complicating this is the fact that I was attacked by a dog as a kid, and whereas I thought I wasn‚Äôt scared of dogs, when she starts jumping on me and hurting me, it triggers a significant fear response, making it hard for me to remain calm. I just want to get away from her and get somewhere safe.",karma_cats,2022-11-29,23:35:10,2022,11,29,23,35,Tuesday

0,DogAdvice,Sensitive stomach or just stubborn about food?,"CW: lots of talk about feces, urine, and vomit

We have two dogs one M 10 and one F 3. They are both from a shelter, we rescued them both as puppies. 

For her whole adult life, our female dog has had ongoing problems with accidents in the house and chronic vomiting. She often refuses to eat at meal time or tries to eat our male dog‚Äôs senior dog food. She will go a whole day or two without eating sometimes. She vomits in the early morning at least once a week, sometimes many days out of the week. It‚Äôs usually bright yellow foam that comes up but sometimes she also vomits food. The vet said she was vomiting in the morning because her stomach was too empty so she had us start feeding the second meal later. They currently eat around 8-9 am and 6-7 pm. They do what we consider to be ‚Äúbegging‚Äù for dinner starting around 5 pm so we feel like their bodies must be feeling hungry by then. Changing the time they ate did not improve the situation. The vet told us her refusing to eat isn‚Äôt an issue unless she is loosing weight but her weight stays pretty consistent. 

She also has accidents in the house often. Sometimes she gets excited and dribbles some pee while she is running around. She also will be laying down and then jump up quickly and there will be a large wet spot under her. Both of those things are pretty occasional. 

What happens most often is she poops in the house in the early morning or when we leave her alone. We always let her out right before bed, as soon as we wake up, and before we leave the house with many other potty breaks throughout the day. We also praise her when we see her go potty outside. She is not very treat-motivated so the vet suggested we play her favorite toy with her immediately after she does the desired behavior. Even sometimes after she has JUST gone out, she will come inside and go on the floor. She usually has very soft (but not liquid) stool and has had infected scent glands before, so the vet asked us to give her fiber with her food. It seems to make a small difference. 

She has been to the vet about this many times. They have tested her and examined her but found no clear health issues. They have suggested that she may just have a sensitive stomach, she may be really stubborn, or a mixture of both. They had us start her on dog food for sensitive stomachs and we have tried a handful of options. We always gradually transition between foods. She seems to be excited when we offer a new food but loses interest and stops eating at meal times within a couple weeks. We don‚Äôt mind giving her variety but the vet specifically said to always feed her the same food to prevent more stomach discomfort for her. We do give very small fruit and vegetable snacks of people food but we are careful to limit it. Those do not seem to correlate with her accidents or vomiting. 

Has anyone experienced anything like this? I know it‚Äôs a lot of information and that there very well may be health and behavior problems working together here. My main concern is that we‚Äôre handling this wrong and it could affect her long term health. My selfish, secondary concern is that I don‚Äôt want to clean up constant accidents for the rest of her life. Any suggestions on what to do? Or how to approach this with the vet so we don‚Äôt feel brushed off once again?",La_Mexifina,2022-11-29,23:22:00,2022,11,29,23,22,Tuesday
0,DogAdvice,Advice for working with a newly adopted American Staffordshire Terrier,"Hi! My wife and just adopted (almost three weeks ago) a 3 yo American Staffordshire Terrier. She's very sweet and affectionate,  but we're having some issues with walking her - mainly she's becoming increasingly reactive to dogs (she really wants to meet them and we're wary of that because we are working on her walking manners). We've also noticed she's become stubborn/reactive on walks - we think she's overwhelmed with the number of stimuli in our neighborhood.  


Some context: We live in a small New England city in a third-floor apartment - so she has to contend with stairs (also becoming an issue). Our neighborhood is full of people with dogs and is densely populated, so, in addition to dogs, there are also lots of schools, cars, people, etc... like I wrote, lots of distractions/stimuli. 

We've adjusted our walking schedule to accommodate her and she's fine when we walk her early in the morning (like 5:30 am) and if we walk her in areas that are quieter and less active. While this is working at the moment we realize that this is not a realistic solution. We need her to get more acclimated to where we live and also want walking her to be something we all enjoy. We are starting a reactive dog training class next week.   


Did we make a bad judgment call in adopting this breed given our housing and being in an urban environment? Any advice? While it hasn't gotten bad, I'm concerned her reactivity could escalate...",JohnProvidence,2022-11-29,22:40:39,2022,11,29,22,40,Tuesday

0,DogAdvice,"I can't afford my dog's regular food right now, but he's not doing well with the cheap stuff.","I was buying him Wholesome's Sensitive Skin &amp; Stomach with lamb protein, the vet recommended getting him a sensitive stomach kind, but it's $60/bag and my new job doesn't start until the end of December. I got him beef Alpo's this time which isn't sensitive stomach but was less than a third of the price, and he's been eating that for over a week, mixed with his old food at first, and it's about half gone now but he doesn't like it very much and his poops are soft and stinky. 

It definitely wasn't meant to be a long-term solution to get him Alpo's, but I have $250 from two and a half days of training that I have to make last all month for transportation, groceries, and his stuff.

0,DogAdvice,How to deal with a very not confident and anxious dog?,"Hey all so I have an amazing dog named Dash. He‚Äôs been with me and my girlfriend for about 5 months now. We got him from a ‚Äúbreeder‚Äù in Kentucky which is where we live. He was an hour away. So when we got him we didn‚Äôt get all the info we were asking from this ‚Äúbreeder.‚Äù Said he was chill, laid back, and leash trained and crate trained. We get him bring him home and he ends up being not leash trained or crate trained at all. On top seems very very anxious. But we get he‚Äôs in a very very new environment. We live in the city Lexington in KY so he went from probably silence to straight helicopters, millions of sirens, and many many college kids with their parties. We wanted to move to a quieter place for us and for dash. Dashes history is pretty much he is a different dog when he‚Äôs outside. Terrified of anything. Anytime we grab the leash he will go hide. He loves his treats but is not at all treat motivated outside. We ended up getting a great bathroom schedule going and has been doing a lot better.

Now we just recently moved to a new apartment which was supposed to be quieter for us and dash. We end up being put in a unit that is literally next to the highway. So just constant noise. He did okay with walking first couple days but he‚Äôs become worse. Tugs on the leash bad to try to go back home and when we leave him in the dog run to do his business all he does is pace crazily back and forth. He‚Äôll eventually pee but after like 10 minutes. We do have this lengthy grass strip right in front of our unit and we‚Äôve been trying to get him to do his business in there so he could avoids the stress of the long walk to the dog park area. 

Now I‚Äôm not a dog trainer and never dealt with this before. It‚Äôs very stressful not only for dash but for me and my girlfriend bc we want what‚Äôs best for him bc we think he was borderline neglected. We had to get him groomed a lot bc when we got him his fur was matted. So any advice or tips on what we could do? Feel free to reach out and ask questions!

0,DogAdvice,"Neutered dog's ""rocket"" won't fully retract","It doesn't look red or swollen, I haven't noticed any issues with urinating and it doesn't seem to be causing him pain. He was neutered around 12 months old and is now 4 years old, he's a 3kg chihuahua/JRT mix. He has been licking himself more the past few months (and seems to be enjoying it) and it will fully protrude, but now when he's just running around or lying down the tip protrudes about 1cm while it used to be fully retracted all of the time. It seems to correlate with when our other dog was last in season and was trying to encourage him to mate with her, it seems like he's now constantly horny or something!

My question really is whether this is something to be concerned about or not - Google searches haven't really been helpful and I've not experienced this with previous dogs. If it looked irritated or he was showing pain or difficulties urinating I'd take him straight to a vet of course, but wondering if it will resolve itself in time or if he's just a horny bugger now",xMimichella,2022-11-29,20:21:28,2022,11,29,20,21,Tuesday

0,DogAdvice,fear period or anxious puppy?,"
my maltipoo is going to be 4 months this friday. is it common for puppies this age to be fearful of strangers? when we go on walks if if strangers ignore him he will go up to them and sniff their feet and if the stranger puts their hand out he might even give a sniff, but if a stranger were to approach him first, he gets nervous, growls, and will go inbetween my legs. if a stranger is walking towards us on a walk, he will stop, stare, i try to get his attention and once the stranger comes closer, he hides between my legs. 

with other dogs, if the dog is too excited, he will have tail tucked, growl, even snap. but if the dog ignores him, he is fine and will even approach the dog himself with tail wagged. it seems like he feels comfortable only if he is the one to approach the person on his own terms. which makes sense. but it‚Äôs hard when it‚Äôs family members like my grandmother who he just can‚Äôt seem to warm up to‚Ä¶but again she is pretty persistent and even though i‚Äôve told her to ignore him, she just really wants to be accepted by him and is always offering treats, which i can tell he is just uncomfortable. 

do you think he will get over this? or will it be a constant battle for the rest of his puppy life? i want to take him to puppy school but i‚Äôm afraid he will be scared of the trainer and other dogs",NexusStrange3000,2022-11-29,18:08:16,2022,11,29,18,8,Tuesday
0,DogAdvice,I feel guilty for having authorized the vet to euthanize my dog.,"So my previous dog had been facing illness for years. He was, regardless, a very strong, happy dog. One day he woke up with seizures and drooling. When we arrived at the vet they ran some tests and concluded he had suffered a livre failure that released poisonous toxins into his brain. He was now in vegetative state. He couldn't recognise us, eat or breath on his own. The vet believed he had lost the ability to think at all. They told us that if they removed the tubes that connected him to various machines he would die after convulsing and possibly feel pain for a while. They then recommend us euthanasia, as it would be absolutely painless. I was so distraught. My grandfather had died recently and I could not believe I was about to lose my dog too. I just told them to do whatever they believed to be the best as I had complete trust in this vet. She then euthanized him abd everything was done with dignity. A few days later we came back to collect his ashes, that they had put in a small wooden chest with his name written inside. I thought I didn't feel bad about having authorized the euthanasia until very recently. I started having dreams where I purposefully kill my dog, or where he still is alive and I make the choice to not care for him, always under the argument that ""that's what's best for him"". I feel regret. What if I simply had let him die off the tubes? But that could have hurt him more according to the vet. I miss him so much and I feel guilty.

I've have my pup since she was a baby for about 5 years now. Never once had to deal with fleas. Well, me being a big ole softie for animals, I found a kitten. My dog would not leave her alone and wouldn't come into the house unless I grabbed it and brought it inside because I had to go to work. Well, I thought I was being smart and giving her a dawn bath to make sure there were no fleas and I swear there wasn't. My plan was to take her to a shelter after work but my mom kept pushing it off and then my sister got attached to her and long story short she's still here after a year. I've been good at making sure my dog has flea collars and topicals but now? I have a minor infestation. I also have a bunny, had him 4 years and never had fleas either until now. I've tried Adams flea spray, tropiclean flea home spray, dawn baths, flea collars  and for some odd reason it's not working! My vaccum broke so I can't vaccum my carpets but I've sprayed idk how many times. These fleas are super powered.

We have a four year old dog who is house trained, it's only in the past year He's suddenly been doing his business inside the house as well. It's only in one spot, upstairs in front of the door to the toilet. 

Now two good things to mention: He does go out regularly, both on walks and to run about the backyard. He does his business out there frequently and in the past 6 months he's been diagnosed with seizures and is on regular medicine for them. 

When he does his business, he takes a good 10-20 mins to find the perfect spots, because he's easily distracted, but then when he does, he poops around 4-5 times in the backyard and pees as well and then comes back inside. Sometimes almost immediately he races up the stairs when nobody is looking and goes to the toilet up there as well. 
We've blocked the stairs and he either paws at whatever is blocking it and goes up there to the toilet or he jumps over and does the same.

0,DogAdvice,Bitch tried to kill new puppy,"We have a 4 year old Husky bitch, named chula (shoo-lah), her previous owner had her for 3 years and  occasionally hit her when she damaged his cars or made trouble (used to live outdoors with other dogs).

 Now she lives inside the house at my gf's, it's a pretty chill dog, loves to walk, doesn't bark much, but whines when she wants something really bad like human food, she also doesn't destroy furniture or chew anything (she does know how to open the fridge lol), she's loves getting petted, hugged, and kissed, and demands attention whenever my gf and I kiss or hug each other (she doesn't whine but she comes to us to also get some, usually getting on two legs to get hugged).


Well, a week ago my gf's brother gave her a 2 month old male Husky puppy, Chula once killed a puppy when she lived with my gf's mom (a separate house, my gf didn't live there), we thought maybe it was an accident so we used causion and kept them apart, Chula at the living room and the puppy in the bedroom. Two days ago I tried to get the puppy out of the bedroom so Chula could get used to the puppy, when the puppy walked in front of her, she grabbed him by the hip, no warning, and just shook him really hard (the puppy shit himself), we managed to get the puppy off of her, again Chula wasn't mad, nor barking or anything at all.

Luckily the puppy didn't get too hurt, Chula managed to sink one fang and pierced the puppy's skin, we cleaned and disinfected the wound, later got him to the vet to get checked.

I just want advise on how get chula to not be aggressive towards the puppy, Chula is constantly checking the puppy between doors, the vet said to have them separated outside by a fence so she gets used to him but we don't have one, I also tried to have the puppy in my arms so Chula can get used to him but even then she tried to bite him through my arms, and again no warning.",rberumondo25,2022-11-29,12:27:54,2022,11,29,12,27,Tuesday

0,DogAdvice,Dog vomiting question,"First time posting. TW: blood, vomiting







My dog (healthy 6M) threw up bright red blood with little dark clots today. It was about a mouthful and has a lot of mucus in it. He had this problem last February. We were told by our regular vet to take him to the emergency hospital right away and we spent thousands on tests that didn't give any hint at what was wrong and honestly traumatized him. The vet assumed it was either from him eating my cat's feces and that it was worms or that it was allergies to his food. He gave my dog deworming pills and a special dry food that was crazy expensive. The vet had me ween our pupper from the dry food back to his normal diet and to see if that made any difference, but there was no change in any symptoms based upon the diet changes. His sickness in February lasted a week (dark stools from blood, mucus in stools). He threw up blood twice in that week. We had him on the dry food and weened him off over the course of about 1 month. We invested lots of money in a fancy litter box with a lid and that he is unable to access right after this incident in case he was eating cat poop. So we know it isn't the food and it isn't the cat poop now. But here we are, 8 months later with the identical problem.

Today when he vomited blood again and I called my vet right away. They tried AGAIN to have me take him to that super expensive hospital. I told them no. He is eating and otherwise is fine. He is acting just like he did in February when the emergency vet told me that it ""wasn't an emergency"", all blood work and vitals were normal, and made us wait for 8 hours to be seen (but charged us the emergency price for the stay, of course while I slept in the parking lot until 3AM when they discharged him). I have an appointment first thing in the AM with my normal vet. 

I get the feeling this is either ulcers or a broken blood vessel in his throat and I obviously want to treat the real issue and help my poor pupper so this doesn't happen in another 8 months. I just don't want to spend thousands in bills again with no answer at the end of the visit. I would spend any amount needed if the treatment we get actually helps him.

Hoping someone might have some experience with something similar with their dog and can provide some insight I can bring with me to the vet tomorrow.

0,DogAdvice,Advice on whether family member‚Äôs old school mentality is abusive or not and what to do,"My grandpa got a dog (plott hound who is currently a little over a year old), but is using fear tactics to train him. He isn‚Äôt actually trained though. Every time he sees me he gets really excited and jumps on me and all my grandpa does is yell at him to sit. The dog only really listens when my grandpa brings out ‚Äúthe stick‚Äù, a roll of newspaper that‚Äôs been duct taped with a wooden block at the end. I know there are people who just treat animals like this, but it just feels so wrong. I‚Äôm really conflicted because this is family. The whole situation makes me sad. I‚Äôve tried talking to him many times, but he denies that he‚Äôs being abusive. I‚Äôve even brought up getting a trainer and tonight‚Äôs conversation was the first time I was able to kind of convince him, but he says he doesn‚Äôt have the time or money right now. His dog does love him, and he‚Äôs otherwise being taken care of. The poor dog is lacking proper exercise and affection though. I‚Äôm too busy to help and I‚Äôm already taking care of my elderly childhood dog. When my grandpa was first thinking about getting a dog, my brother and I tried telling him to get a dog that has lower energy and has a personality that likes to lounge for most of the day. But he wanted a puppy he could ‚Äúproperly train‚Äù and use as a guard dog. I don‚Äôt know what to do or who to talk to. Other family members just know he‚Äôs like this, but don‚Äôt put much thought into it.

0,DogAdvice,Taking dogs to daycare to get them used to each other. Horrible idea?,"TLDR: anxious 50lb dog is staying in a home with two little dogs. Last time she was here they did not get along well. Will taking them to daycare together for a few days help or is it a terrible idea?

I‚Äôm visiting family for the next month or so and had to bring my dog with me. She‚Äôs the only pet in our home, 50lbs, a husky/lab mix, and has a TON of anxiety. My parents have two dogs, both about 15 lbs. One is a rat terrier and the other is a chihuahua mix. 

We brought my dog here last year and it didn‚Äôt go well. They barked at each other and then my dog snapped at one of the other dogs because they kept getting in her face. Like I said, she‚Äôs anxious so she gets nervous when one of the little dogs is running around and darting in and out of her space. 

This year, we‚Äôve been keeping them separated on different levels of the house. My parents really want them to mingle because it‚Äôs a hassle but I‚Äôm afraid to let them. 

We had the idea to take them to a doggy daycare for a few days and let them get used to each other there and then try to bring them home together. Is that a terrible idea? She‚Äôs already freaked out being here and I‚Äôm afraid it will be counterproductive for her.",tackyshark,2022-11-29,09:32:48,2022,11,29,9,32,Tuesday
0,DogAdvice,Dog hit during rehousing,"TLDR: Dog was hit by a during rehousing, but is home safely today. Any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

I was planning on adopting a new family member in the form of a male chihuahua on Saturday, but that was delayed when he was hit by a car during the exchange. We met in a public parking lot, but the poor little guy pulled off his harness and ran into the street. He was hit by a car, and the tire went over his body. 

Both his old family and myself rushed him to the nearest vet hospital, and luckily, the little guy is miraculously home two days after the accident. 

He suffered no broken bones, no fractures, no ruptures, or even road burns. The only thing that happened was he had internal bleeding that needs medicine and a week of rest. The vet said that he was very ""stoic"" and was clearly ""made of steel"", so I feel super lucky. Mind you the car was no bug or 1 seater. This was your classic Honda/Jetta type of car.

We got him to our home today, and he has his crate, food, water, blankets, and has taken his medicine to help his injuries. We have already let him meet 2 of his 4 siblings, but we didn't want to rush it because he needed rest. 

Does anybody have any advice on how to keep him (5 pd. Chihuahua) safe and comfortable for the adjustment period and from the accident without neglecting to socialize him with our other dogs (10 pd. Chihuahua, 5 pd. Chihuahua, 4 pd. Chihuahua, and 15 pd. Pekingese)?",KarmaticKenny,2022-11-29,09:27:11,2022,11,29,9,27,Tuesday

He is allergic to most meats and we‚Äôre currently investigating environmental allergies, he has a VERY strict diet and gets allergy medication every few days.

0,DogAdvice,Dog terrified of Mums Cough/ Ringtone,"We‚Äôve had our rescue dog for 5 years now (Luna, 8yo female GSD mix) She has an unknown past and was found stray.

She has no issue with loud noises dogs are usually afraid of- traffic, low planes, other dogs barking, fireworks- She won‚Äôt flinch or anything.

However, if my mum coughs in the house  Luna will run away and hide. Her ears back, wide eyed and licks her lips. 

Same story with my mums ringtone. She reacts to any ringtone but only on my mums phone. 

If they are out on a walk and my mum coughs, Luna will stick to her side like glue, and has a slow, low wagging tail for a couple moments (Along with the other body language I previously mentioned)

‚Äî

Any advice on desensitising and training her to have a neutral response would be excellent.

Also to note : 

-Despite being fairly food driven, she won‚Äôt take a treat while she‚Äôs in that state. Or, she will take a treat and immediately run off.

-I do have reflex to comfort her when she does react, telling her things like ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs okay!‚Äù and giving her pets and kisses. Which I will admit, probably isn‚Äôt helping.",purroway22,2022-11-29,00:08:35,2022,11,29,0,8,Tuesday

* Trainable/eager to learn
* People friendly demeanor
* Mediumish coat ( I think its cuter to have some fluff )  


This leads me to think that I want to adopt some kind of retriever (golden, flat coated, lab, etc) but I have also been considering German Shepard Dogs (GSD) since they fit all the criteria that are important to me except maybe the first. They are also much easier to find than than very popular retrievers like goldens.

I hear many people say they are prone to being very vocal like other shepards and collies.

0,DogAdvice,Dog aggressive to new puppy,"So my family got a new puppy for some background context that‚Äôll make all you dog owners probably face palm (this was not my decision to get a new dog) We own 2 cats and 1 dog the 2 cats don‚Äôt fuck with the puppy who‚Äôs name is Luna they might hiss if she tries playing with them but never attack her just basically telling Luna to go away. Now the other dog we have is Ivy. I was really young when we got her and you can tell this dog was unfortunately not raised good she puts her ears back and thinks your gonna hit her when you pet her and overall is very skittish of other people except me and my family. We used to have another dog Quincy and quite often the two would get into fights and eventually after one fight Quincy was hurt bad so bad we sadly had to put him down. I don‚Äôt blame Ivy she could‚Äôve been raised a lot better where she wouldn‚Äôt be aggressive and any sane dog owner would not get a new dog after knowing the dog they have now got the previous dog killed. Just 2 days into having Luna, Ivy thought she was gonna take her bone and attacked her luckily I was right there and broke it up but Luna has a tiny tiny little mark from where Ivy literally had her jaws around her head. I told my mom this and i‚Äôm trying to get it through to her that Luna is a American terrier pit bull mixed with a bull (or atleast I think i‚Äôm not a dog person really so I don‚Äôt know breeds) So having this young puppy grow up where a dog is attacking her will have her grow up and be aggressive back to other dogs and even Ivy. She‚Äôs gonna be a big dog and I really don‚Äôt wanna see two big ass dogs go at it because it will most likely end very very bad. So now I really don‚Äôt know what to do it‚Äôs unfair to get rid of Ivy and it‚Äôs a little risky to try and raise Luna in this type of environment. so far i‚Äôve kinda been the one to step up and train Luna to be a good dog as-well as giving Ivy attention and trying to get the two to bond it‚Äôs stressful I will say especially cause i can‚Äôt be around the two 24/7 and my mom thinks it‚Äôs perfectly fine to leave the two dogs in the house alone without putting Luna in a room to keep away from Ivy. I think after I get paid ill buy a crate to put her in for the time being till she‚Äôs older because when no one‚Äôs home and if Ivy attacks no one can break up that fight and Luna will grow up to view Ivy as dangerous and eventually start fighting back and a pitbull going up against a husky is not something I want to happen man. So overall any advice is really needed, is there a way I can retrain Ivy to be more confident and not skittish? and even have her be less aggressive to the puppy.

0,DogAdvice,How to get my german shepherd puppy to respect my cat's boundaries?,"Pretty self-explanatory title. I have a 9 mo old GSD and a 2.5 yr old bengal cross cat. My pup is obsessed with my cat. Not in like a stalking prey-drive way, but like an idolizing way. He adores her. Steals slippers and brings them to her as a gift lol. 

Now, my cat is a covid-cat and prior to getting my dog was an only fur-child. She's very possessive of me to say the least. There have been these instances that show my cat truly *loves* my dog, but she certainly doesn't *like* him. He is everything she hates ‚Äì loud, smelly, hyper, and too close to me. 

My cat has grown more tolerant and lets him come near her but sometimes he gets too carried away poking her with his nose or jumping up towards where she is so she will hiss or growl. He gets more excited and keeps going so she'll start smacking him but he just doesn't leave her alone. The other day she managed to scratch his eye. He's ok but he very much has not learned anything.

\- They are never left alone. If I or my roommate have to leave, my dog is in his crate. I don't suspect anything would happen but I don't want to find out

\- My dog's body language has never been threatening. It's playful and light and seems like he genuinely just wants to play

\- My cat doesn't instigate anything, she just is defensive. She'll be fine once he learns her boundaries (growling, hissing, hitting)",hudadancer,2022-11-28,13:44:00,2022,11,28,13,44,Monday

After being lucky for 10 years the vet said that we should do a topical preventative for her. Not something I want my poor baby to go through again. 

I typically give her a bath after being out in the woods and park and check to see if I see anything now.

After doing the first topical treatment says to put it in three or four spots on her fur.

0,DogAdvice,Trying to get advice prior to foster dog arriving: how to stop marking and humping,"As the title suggests, I am looking to get all my ducks in a row before he comes next month.

My brother informs me the dog cannot have a bed in his crate because he humps, supposedly he marks, and he poos when he's excited??


I think for humping (he says it's dominance but hasn't that been debunked?) getting him more exercise should help right? Right now he gets maybe, and I do mean maybe, a 5 minute walk everyday or every other day.

Marking- he is intact but he is also 8?(we think) I will be speaking to my vet about neutering and if it's safe for his age but what enzyme cleaner would be best to help with marking and to prevent it?

Excited poo- I don't even know where to begin. I was told even if he was outside and pooped, he still does it when he's excited?

I am doing an embark test on him because I feel knowing his breeds might help. Brother states he's a chi/Yorkie but I see a chi/Jack Russel.",ComicPlatypus,2022-11-28,05:41:03,2022,11,28,5,41,Monday

We‚Äôve both caved twice each and while he‚Äôs on the couch he just snuggles for 20 minutes and then returns to his own bed. At this point it‚Äôs exhausting constantly monitoring him and the only way he will stay off long term is if we yell which we hate. If we crate him (about 20 minutes) we only get a 2-5 minute break and then he‚Äôs back to wanting on the couch and mouthing when he doesn‚Äôt get his way.

So please help! Should we give in? Stay strong? What has been your experience?

He will go down the stairs on his own though.

0,DogAdvice,Urinary incontinence in 8m spayed pup,"Hi all, 

I adopted my puppy from a shelter at 6 months old- she was already spayed when we adopted her. Since day 1 we noticed that she was having frequent pee accidents in the house. I suspected a UTI and it turned out to be the case (even though the vet was skeptical, I was adamant that it wasn‚Äôt just behavioral). The uti was still there after a week of antibiotics. The vet then suggested to do a month long course of antibiotics, which we are now coming to the end of. 

Now and a few times previously I have noticed that my pup sometimes leaks urine when she‚Äôs sleeping.

I am taking her back for a follow up with the vet this week, but she has had a radiograph in the last month to rule out stones. 

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone out there has had a similar experience with a pup that was spayed very young? Is it poor muscle tone?

Or has anyone experienced incontinence in dogs who receive calming treats with hemp seed powder? (She takes two of the Zesty paws calming bites daily as recommended by the brand for her weight) I‚Äôm considering taking this out of her regiment as an experiment to see if there are any improvements until we actually see the vet.

0,DogAdvice,Isolation Stress - Part Two,"My last post was really a typical post about separation anxiety or isolation stress, and the automod posted some useful links for advice to follow, so I'll start that asap.

This post is more about some specific advice to manage the situation as I attempt to resolve it.

Basically, the dog barks through the night, I get up, try to settle him back in his crate, which never works, so I end up letting him in the living room to sleep on the sofa. I (try to) sleep on the other sofa, so he's doubly rewarded by getting to sleep on the sofa AND have me there with him.

The alternative, that I've just thought about while I lie awake on the sofa after another night of barely any sleep, is to actually set up a camp bed in the kitchen to see if he will then sleep through the night, and allow the rest of the house (and neighbours) to actually get some sleep.

I'm just wondering what the least-worst option is right now to save the family's sanity - keep letting him in the living room to sleep when he wakes up during the night, or seeing if he'll sleep though with me on a camp bed in the kitchen with him? I'm not sure right now what the exit strategy for either of those options is!

He's probably sleeping though the night without waling up one night in four - so he can do it.

My dog is 5yrs old and when she came inside after running around in the yard this evening I noticed her face was quickly swelling up. I gave her an antihistamine, she‚Äôs breathing/behaving normally, and is asleep right now. 

But I‚Äôm still worried to go to sleep because I don‚Äôt want her to go into shock while I‚Äôm unconscious.

I know I‚Äôm probably stressing for no reason but I‚Äôd appreciate any advice/calming words 

TL;DR - My dog‚Äôs face is swelling up and she is behaving normally and is sleeping soundly. And even though I gave her an antihistamine I‚Äôm still worried and would appreciate any kind words/advice",krisbcrafting,2022-11-27,12:58:29,2022,11,27,12,58,Sunday

0,DogAdvice,Prozac for this dog... What's the story / Can they go without?,"I'm ab outdoorsy kinda guy. I'm a fan of ""big dog"" behaviour. Get them in the water, hiking, jogging, and do the dog parks. Let them exercise, eat, rest, and be loved. Simple really.

Now, I'm dogsitting two little Spoodles. They have a stunning home, but they don't get much exercise I'm thinking - spoiled indoor pooches. They are different / needy like I've never seen. One is on Prozac. It's a proper pain trying to force it down its mouth (hidden in treats, it's spit out).

So. Question. I'm going to make the outdoor dogs in the next two weeks. Exercise. Other dogs. Parks. Rest, etc... I'm hoping ""activity"" will stimulate the brain / tire the out to replace the drugs.

Will the Prozac be necessary? Thoughts? Thanks in advance for any advice.",Seattle_in_Syd,2022-11-27,12:48:16,2022,11,27,12,48,Sunday

0,DogAdvice,Help getting dog to take liquid medicine?,"My dog ate a wooden skewer that perforated and led to a giant abscess so he has a bunch of antibiotics to take. They smell acidic like lemonade so he wants nothing to do with them. I'm really hoping someone has tricks that can help us.

He's on a bland diet because of associated GI distress so I'm really limited on what I can mix it with to get him to take it. I tried mixing it with the chicken and rice, he's refusing to eat it even though he's hungry.

My dog is a bit on the reactive/high strung side. He isn't aggressive but he will bite if I invade his space too much. He's also wary of us because he was manhandled (understandably) at the vet and he isn't feeling well. So even getting to his mouth with the syringe without him showing his teeth or snapping is a challenge.

He has an open wound where they drained the abscess so it can continue to drain so I really don't want to wrestle him and risk hurting him.

0,DogAdvice,Am I overstimulating my food-motivated dog to the point of urination in the house?,"Hi friends, first time rescue mum over here. I‚Äôm learning all I can about my new dog‚Äîit‚Äôs information overload on the web/YouTube so your advice and perspectives are very appreciated.

We adopted our wonderful Raya (2F) from the shelter 3 weeks ago. I‚Äôve observed she LOVES food, nothing she won‚Äôt do for a training treat and mealtime is her favorite time. Raya loves the kibble dispensing toys, Lick Mats, Snuffle Mats, stuffed Kongs, you name it. I work from home, so I‚Äôm happy to give her these things throughout the day to keep her occupied.

But Raya is frequently peeing in the house (1-2x daily for weeks) despite being healthy and taken outside frequently and given lavish praise/treats for toileting outside. Usually a few ounces of urine in the same spots each time, and I never catch her doing it. 

Seems like whenever I take my eyes off her to focus on something else (my dish, the stove, vacuuming), she‚Äôll stealth-pee and act like nothing happened. I don‚Äôt discipline/yell at her or anything, of course.

What‚Äôs usually happening when she pees‚Äîwe‚Äôre eating, there‚Äôs people food around (I cook a lot), she‚Äôs playing with her Wobble (kibble dispensing toy), she‚Äôs got some sort of food toy like a Snuffle mat, I‚Äôve left the room and she‚Äôs alone or with husband (who she likes but she spends far less time with), I‚Äôm vacuuming (I crate her and go slowly/avoid her area to not scare her).

Raya gets 2-3 25+ min walks + quick potty breaks daily, I‚Äôd guess she‚Äôs outside every few hours (I even set timers). But she‚Äôs quite content snoozing on the couch all day.

I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs possible I‚Äôve rushed her transition to a new home and overloaded her, especially with too much high stimulus food toy time? 

My initial approach was to build up her confidence being alone, since she‚Äôd whine/pace/be destructive whenever I‚Äôd leave the floor. Also it seemed like she spent a lot of time snoozing or following me around. So, I started giving her a lot of food toy distractions and leave, hoping she‚Äôd associate good things with being alone.

What‚Äôs going on and what could I be doing wrong? How can I stop the inappropriate peeing?

Thanks in advance, everyone.",NoProdigalSon,2022-11-27,10:14:14,2022,11,27,10,14,Sunday
0,DogAdvice,Neighbors complaining about my dog‚Ä¶,"I have lived in my current apartments for more than 3 years and have had my dog for as of today 1 year and 8 months, a maltipoo that weighs no more than 8.5 pounds. I had downstairs neighbors who were always great and our friends, never seemed to complain about a single thing and even then we would acknowledge if we were a bit loud and apologize to them when we could. There were over 3 people living in that apartment and they had a dog the same as us so my dog was always able to play around with their dog and we all got along great. Eventually though they moved and in came new neighbors and no more than a few weeks later we began to hear them hitting their roof with most likely a broom and at first we didn‚Äôt know what it was for as we all tend to stay in our rooms or on the couch, but as time went on we noticed this was happening while my dog ran around with zoomies. Eventually we got a note on our door stating they were tired of the noise and have knocked on our door many times to speak to our face about the matter, but it never said anything about the disturbance of sleep or work mind you, and they said they would hear it more in the afternoon than any other time which no one is home from 11-4 so we had a chat with them face to face and explained the noise as well as introduced our pet to them to clear it up. So we apologized and went our way but fast forward maybe not 2 days later we‚Äôre hearing the banging again after trying our best to keep our dog calm and sat, but with the endless hitting of the roof we begin to care less and less and become more annoyed with them as we are try our best to keep our dog quiet and no later than 8:30 too and it‚Äôs to be courteous but I will admit I‚Äôve come home at maybe 12 am before and have seen then up and moving almost seems they never sleep, but nonetheless even during the day and afternoon the sound seems still too much and they are constantly complaining. We have carpet, the apartments allow pets, my dog doesn‚Äôt have overly long nails as he gets groomed regularly, and the zoomies never last past maybe 10 minutes. We‚Äôve tried everything from speaking to them and addressing the problem which we thought would help them understand us more to keeping our dog quiet, and leaving the balcony doors open for him to sit outside (we have protective railing) and maybe play in.

0,DogAdvice,I can't tell if my dream to own a dog is stupid or not,"I can't tell if I'm not being supported enough or if I'm just being stupid

Since I was really young, I've always wanted a papillon dog (tiny dog with pretty ears for those who don't know).  Even when I was a child and didn't know the breed I would draw that exact dog on my school work constantly.


A few months ago I got a dog, a german shepherd puppy, which caused me to have a panic attack since she was so big and clumsy and I worried she would hurt my cat. With a heavy heart, I had to give her away. I was convinced to consider a other cat instead, but deep down I knew I didn't want another cat. I want to take care of a dog. My sister can do it, why can't I?


The problem now is my mother. She's really upsetting me telling me I can't handle a dog when she knows the reason I freaked out. An adult, small, calm temperament dog fixes the problem, and she recommended the solution in the first place. But now she's saying I can't do it and it's breaking my heart. My cat would love some company, he's fine around dogs and loves when other cats come to the window (they don't like him as much as he likes them though).


Am I going mad? Am I really not able to handle a dog? Just thinking about giving up on my dream of owning one has me in tears. Help?",L4dyR0se,2022-11-27,08:20:42,2022,11,27,8,20,Sunday
0,DogAdvice,2 yo dog is constantly seeking an escape,"We adopted our pup around two years ago when she was approximately 3 months old. One of her littermates had a DNA test done and they are true mutts, but their closest breed matches were Australian Cattle Dog &amp; Boxer. In most aspects, she is a fantastic dog. Loyal, smart, energetic, sweet, and a great big sister to our 5 month old shepherd. 

However, whenever she is let outside she seeks an escape, no matter where or how much space she‚Äôs given. We live in the city but have a reasonably-sized fenced in yard. She is CONSTANTLY searching for or creating holes in the fence trying to escape. When she‚Äôs at the dog park, which is a massive space of land, she is sniffing the perimeter searching for a way to leave. When we visit my mom, who lives on an acre+ of fenced in land and has other dogs for her to play with, she STILL seeks a way to leave.

When we picked her up for adoption, she was flagged by the agency as a flight risk, which we took to mean she would flee when panicked or scared. We were gentle in our care and have done all we know how to do to make her comfortable. We do not believe she is fleeing from fear, just maybe curiosity and boredom.

She does not lack in enrichment and exercise. She goes for long walks, runs around like crazy in our yard, visits the dog park almost every day, and plays with our other dog 24/7. She eats well, sleeps well, etc.

Has anyone dealt with this before? We would love any insight and advice. We of course take all precautions to keep her safe, especially in the city, and we don‚Äôt leave her out for long stretches, and never alone. But it feels like every time we let our guard down she finds a way to get out. Thank you in advance!",Thin_Internet9472,2022-11-27,08:20:07,2022,11,27,8,20,Sunday

My 10 months old mutt is slowly stopping to eat/not eating her whole bowl of dry kibble at lunchtime. I feed her twice a day, once at noon and once in the evening. For lunchtime she's barely eating, but in the evening she gobbles down her food. She seems otherwise normal, being the energetic trouble maker as always. It has been getting hotter and drier during the last few days, so I'm wondering if maybe the heat is causing her to lose some apetite during the day.

0,DogAdvice,Dog Sick and Vets can‚Äôt figure out why,"My 6year old dog (mixed breed but not sure exactly what breed since he was a rescue, about 18lbs) has been sick for the last two weeks and the vet can‚Äôt figure out what is wrong with him. 

About 7 weeks ago he hurt his back legs/back. He was outside to pee and he yelped randomly. We brought him to the vet and they said it might be a slipped disk and to keep him off his back two legs as much as possible. For about 3-4 weeks after he couldn‚Äôt walk up the stairs in our home and he had some weakness in his back legs. 

He started to get better but was never at 100%. We tried to limit his walking up stairs as much as we could because we wanted him to give his body a chance to heal. 

Then about 6 weeks after the injury he started to get gastro symptoms. He started to throw up and diarrhea. We brought him to the vet and they did a blood test and found that his white blood cells were elevated. He started to recover from the gastro 4 days later but the vet had recommended we put him on antibiotics due to the elevated white blood cells. We started the antibiotics on day 4 of him having gastro like symptoms. On day 5 he started to act more like himself. He had an appetite again and was more or less back to normal except his back legs were still weak. He was back to normal for 6 days then at night he started shaking and wouldn‚Äôt eat his food. 

We brought him back to the vet the next day and he had a fever of 104.5. We were sent for X-rays to check for any issues with his hips, legs, and chest and all came back normal. We also did blood work to check for ticks, heart worm and other tick borne illnesses and all came back clear as well. 

The following day he was sent for an ultrasound and he came back all clear as well. However he still had a fever of 104.18. At this point the vet is not sure what can be causing him to be sick. We were given a stronger antibiotic that also has some anti inflammatory in it and just started him on this last night. They‚Äôre thinking it might be an acute infection somewhere that they haven‚Äôt been able to locate OR the start of pancreatitis, however they‚Äôre not sure at this point.

Has anyone had a similar experience with their pup? Any ideas/advice on how to help him? Thanks for your input.",time_to_hustle,2022-11-26,21:28:50,2022,11,26,21,28,Saturday

0,DogAdvice,"My parents adopted a 5 month old Great Pyrenees, is her behavior concerning?","My parents adopted a Great Pyrenees puppy two days ago, she is a 5 month old female. One of my relatives said they saw her walking around before we came in, but the moment us and the breeder came into her space, she was cornering herself, acting shy and not moving or trying to get away from us, while the golden retriever in the cage next to her was jumping and licking our hands. I know a Pyr isn't quite as playful as a Golden, but the breeder told us this one have always been shy and her sister who was adopted one day before was said to be active and playful. The breeder told us they did not fed her this day, so she doesn't puke in the car.

&amp;#x200B;

In the car (my parents were driving for two hours), she kept doing this thing where she was pointing her snout to her stomach and she farted a few times. When we came back home, she was cornering herself, looking at us like we had just punished her, and refused to eat and drink until night, also didn't pee and poop the day my parents took her home.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, she both peed and poop and it looked normal, she agreed to eat (same brand as the breeder fed her, something ProPlan) and drink, and today the same. She is still isn't particularly active or cuddly, though, and all she wants to do is go in the garden, but she mostly pees at home (hopefully, that is just temporary). We haven't been able to walk her outside of the garden yet, because she doesn't move much and she is very stubborn about it. She is not fearful at all with our cats and us, though. She is shy, and extremely calm (she barked just once), but not exactly scared of us.

&amp;#x200B;

She still does the snout pointing at her stomach, though, and I think she farted again, I'm not sure if it's anything we should be worried about?

&amp;#x200B;

I know she is new and this is not a cuddly/playful breed necessarily, but does that sound normal? I'm not a dog person at all, and this is the first time my parents got this breed",Nympheacees,2022-11-26,20:26:23,2022,11,26,20,26,Saturday

0,DogAdvice,I need help and don't know where to turn,"I'm a 16 year old male, my family owns a 6 year old German Shepherd and for the most part he's a great dog he gets a long great with friends and family and he's super sweet but he has issues with other dogs and I don't know what to do about it. I'm the only one who can really do anything as my parents aren't willing to pay for a dog trainer or put in any work themselves. My dad isn't great with him and is too prideful to admit it or ask for help and my mom just doesn't get involved.

&amp;#x200B;

it should be said he of course is a big dog much bigger than most german shepherds up to 90-110 pounds. When we walk and he sees another dog he starts going rigid just staring at the dog sometimes just sniffing the ground and using that as a way to just look at the dog and then as the dog gets closer his ears will go up and he'll get more rigid and if the dog gets too close he'll start pulling and sometimes growling and barking. I've tried so many times to break his cycle I've used spray bottles to try and get his attention  I've tried ignoring the dog and to keep walking and so that he may take the hint as I've found he tends to look back at me before doing a lot of things but it's like he can't make the connection that he's doing something wrong. He's had dog friends in the past he had a little chihuahua friend that got hit by a car. When I'm not around or when he's at doggy daycare our family has been told that he does fine with other dogs. He's had this problem for a long time but I think it worsened when he was once attacked by a mastiff at around 1 or 2 years old and my dad would probably encourage bad behavior or treat him in ways that did not help him developmentally. 

I love my dog and I know he can do better and don't want to give up but I'm running out of ideas on what to do any help would be appreciated. Apologies if this is somewhat incoherent it's late and I'm kinda just venting to an extent but I need help and need to fix this.",I_AM_JEX,2022-11-26,19:00:29,2022,11,26,19,0,Saturday

0,DogAdvice,Complicated housebreaking...,"So about ten months ago, we adopted a dog from a buddy. Hela is a Shi Tzu mutt mix of some kind that they found on the side of the road in the desert about six years ago- she is now roughly 10 years old.

Long story short- buddy works long hours and so does his wife. Hela stayed in a crate overnight and as long as they were at work. Then buddy got two husky pups- and proceeded to not have time for them either. All of them were crated excessively and often together in one large crate which resulted in Hela getting bullied by the huskies.

It was only after she started losing massive amounts of weight did he bother to think about rehoming her. I should mention this is my husband's buddy- who lived nearly two hours from us so we didn't really see the dogs at all until he brought up his difficulty trying to get a shelter to take her.

She was severely matted, dragged her belly across the floor because she was so scared of everything, and emaciated. It was terrible. We decided to take her home, and we've had her ever since.

We've been approaching things one at a time- earning whatever trust she'll give us, getting her used to being on a leash and going on walks, working on her anxiety- little by little. She's now a healthy weight and still super anxious, but it's not nearly a bad as those first few months. We're working with a vet on maybe getting her medicated to sort out the rest since it feels like her days are just so miserable still.

I'm home most of the day, my husband is Navy so he's gone for fair amounts of time. We take her out every 4-6 hours (no yard) which is what we've found to be her limit for bathroom needs.


However. Nighttime is a different story.

Because of the years of excessive crating, she's unable to be left in a crate. Well, I suppose she could, but she's thrashing, crying, and trying to dig her way out the entire time. We didn't really have an option to not crate her, because she's only partially housebroken and I need to sleep. If not crated, she'll mess in the house. Every time. We've tried crate training too, but there's just no point. It's instant deathly panic every time, even if she's in the room with us while crated. Just seeing the crate changes her mood, and she's not a very happy dog to begin with so it's just heartbreaking.

We've finally decided to give up on it - it's not worth the stress she goes through every day and there's literally nowhere I can put her in the apartment that is far enough that she won't wake me up multiple times a night with her panic.

But. Housebreaking.

She technically is housebroken - she knows that she goes to the bathroom outside. However, she will not tell us if she needs to go. Bell training, touch training- nothing worked. She will not tell us. And she will not hold it either. She just goes. Not an issue during the day, but I need to sleep.

We used puppy pads for awhile, thinking there was some success but then we caught our senior cat using them and we found out we were just teaching HIM to piss on the carpet instead. It took months to fix and get him back to using a litter box. Pads are not an option.

So right now it's pretty much either 1) crate her to prevent messing on the carpet overnight, which will destroy her mental health or 2) accept she will piss on the carpet and that there is nothing to be done, just do our best to carpet clean every week. I'm almost to the point of not caring either way, because this stress combined with everything else is way too much on me. Our senior cat is near the end of his life and taking up most of my time and attention- I don't have much left in me.

I have no idea what options we have left are, except maybe diapers overnight. I don't even know if she'll leave them be, or chew them off. She's fine with her winter jacket, but who knows?

Any ideas or advice would be welcome.",Cranksta,2022-11-26,15:23:52,2022,11,26,15,23,Saturday

I don't know why she does this and it's not easy to distract her from doing it. She only seems to do it when she is in the bedroom usually at night, but we also don't watch her while she's outside so i am not sure if she does this during the day.

0,DogAdvice,Issues in crate when away from home,"My 1.5 year old Cavalier is great in her crate at night at home. We go for the bedtime walk and she puts herself to bed when we come in, sleeping through the night. 

Whenever I visit my parents, however, it‚Äôs a different story. Generally her anxiety levels go up for the first day or two we‚Äôre here. I assume that is because sometimes she stays with them when I travel for work, so she‚Äôs unsure if I‚Äôm staying or going. When I leave her with them she‚Äôs totally fine at night. 

The issue is when I am staying at their house. We do her bedtime walk and she puts herself to bed like at home. But minutes later she is barking. The only solution I‚Äôve found is to go sleep on the couch with her for 30mins to an hour and then put her back to bed. (Usually we‚Äôve spent the hours before bedtime laying on the couch watching a movie so it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs missing snuggle time!)

This isn‚Äôt regulated to my parents‚Äô house. This summer we got a vacation rental (just me and the dog) and it took to night 4 for her to go to bed with no barking.

0,DogAdvice,Older dog is acting aggressive,"My older dog is acting up, growled and raised his lip at me

We got a puppy(male)  4 months ago and he is now around the half year mark, he is a nice puppy but sometimes can be somewhat annoying, my older dog (3y male) sometimes reminds him of that by growling at him for a brief second until he submits.
My older dog has show no major issues other than dominating the younger dog, never harming the puppy but playing mouthing games or making him submit when he crosses a line( going after his snack, jumping at his face etc.)
The way we feed them is to tell them to go on their bed, afterwards we put their bowls in their spot and give them the command to go after 3-5 seconds)
I normally feed them at the same time, but a recent trend has happened, where my older dog approaches my puppy, ignoring his own food, and growls at him, when this happens i normally separate them and have them eat alone. 
Today though, he started growling at my puppy and making him submit before i even made them go to bed or put the food down. I found this behaviour bad so 
I sent my dog to another room closed the door and fed the puppy. Then i locked my puppy into a different room and tried to feed the older dog. I put his food down and then told him to go on his bed, but instead of doing so he turned towards me, raised his lips and growled at me, I have previously had a negative experience where he nipped me( less than a cm deep) on my arm when I accidentally provoked( i realise what i did wrong there) but this time it seems almost entirely unprovoked.
Im a little bit shocked right now, I would really like some assistance, I have left my older dog alone in the room he normally rats now and closed the door.
For reference, i am the primary caregiver for the puppy and my older brother for the older dog, he will be returning soon to handle this but i would like to know where i went wrong. Feel free to inquire for more details.",Complex_Mixture_86,2022-11-26,07:34:46,2022,11,26,7,34,Saturday

She cuddles with him, solicits play, leans into petting, all that good doggy stuff.  However, when I'm not in the house she won't go near him except to hastily snatch treats.  He'd be ok just ignoring her and letting her work through it at her own pace except that she has to go out.  It takes a lot of cajoling for him to get her outside when I'm not home, and then she won't come back in.

My sweet little dog, a 1yo Cavalier, chokes on treats very easily. We use her kibble for regular treats on walks (Royal Canin Digestive Care Mini) which she seems to enjoy except for the fact that she has choked on them multiple times now.

She has this kibble for breakfast but the choking has really only occurred while we use it as a treat on walks so far.

This obviously terrifies me. Today was particularly scary as at took multiple attempts before we dislodged the treat and she breathed.

Obviously, we won't be using the kibble for treats again. I am calling our vet tomorrow to see if she needs to be checked over for it, and booking a first aid course.

I am wondering what we can use to reward her on walks without the choking hazard? And if anyone has any suggestions on how we can make it less likely she chokes?",Yyvern,2022-11-26,04:56:33,2022,11,26,4,56,Saturday

She will not stop licking me or climbing in my face when I am around. My SO can walk away and she will still keep doing it.
  We have tried me ignoring her,  keeping her off the couch, no eye contact but she just gets even more anxious and obsessed. We recently have had to start putting her in her crate when I am over due to being unable to eat or have conversations anymore. 
Is there something I can do or some method to reinforce that this is not okay behavior? I am not too upset about it but I hate the stress I can see it gives my partner from not being able to relax.",Switch-Civil,2022-11-26,00:13:15,2022,11,26,0,13,Saturday
0,DogAdvice,Rant: people who make blatant assumptions,"I have a pit bull boxer mix, he‚Äôs a rescue and a big baby. I‚Äôve had him almost 10 years. I was talking to two other dog owners who both made the dumb assumption that he‚Äôs a bad dog and aggressive because he‚Äôs a pit bull. When I corrected them and said that he‚Äôs actually very sweet the man goes ‚Äúoh so he was a bait dog then? That‚Äôs so sad‚Äù 

Sir you are so ignorant. He‚Äôs always been well trained and trusting. He was found on the streets, and my assumption is that either his previous owners lost a very sweet dog or they dumped him because they couldn‚Äôt have him.. or maybe he ran away because they were bad owners. But there is no evidence he was ever a ‚Äúbait dog‚Äù for dog fights. No scars, no aversion to other dogs or people. Just a big snuggle bug.

0,DogAdvice,"[help] My 7 year old was diagnosed with Pyometra, putting her down next week, need help coping","
Hi everyone,
I‚Äôm really writing this for help on how to cope with this. My 7 year old pomeranian/poodle Nala (my first pet) ate chocolate 2 weeks ago; we took her to the vet where she was then diagnosed with diabetes and lost her eyesight the next day (we had a gofundme set up for that but didn‚Äôt raise enough money to restore her sight). Because she was vomiting from the chocolate they put her on a round of antibiotics; she was doing better with the insulin combined with antibiotics, and we took her to the vet yesterday to have a blood glucose monitor installed on her where she was then diagnosed with Pyometra. Her blood sugar is extremely high at 350+ (over what our reader can see) and the pyometra has made her resistant to insulin. For those unfamiliar, pyometra is an infection in the uterus which causes the uterus to rupture this filling the abdomen with pus (where the dog will die in less than a couple of days). We unfortunately don‚Äôt have the money for emergency pyometra surgery (ranging from $1-3k) and we‚Äôre going to have to put her down within the next week to avoid a super painful eventual death; she has a life expectancy of a couple more weeks with pyometra. I had a gofundme set up for cataract surgery to restore her eyesight, which raised around $330, and was going to use that for her urgent pyometra surgery instead but unfortunately it isn‚Äôt enough money and we won‚Äôt be able to raise enough within the next week to save her.
I just wanted to know how to cope with this. We have no option but to euthanize her and this has been extremely tough for my family and I as she is our first pet. To anyone whose pet passed away I really would like to understand the grieving process and if it‚Äôll get any easier. It has been hard enough already and it‚Äôs only been a day since the news; I hope I had done enough for her with the gofundme and all which didn‚Äôt raise much but that was my effort. This was all very sudden as she was happy and healthy just a couple of weeks ago. I‚Äôll be spending my last week with her doing everything she loves. Thank u guys in advance.",OrganizationShot8255,2022-11-25,13:51:57,2022,11,25,13,51,Friday
0,DogAdvice,Hydrolyzed protein food,"I have a 2.5 yo ACD mix who has a history of HGE.

0,DogAdvice,How to enrich my working/field golden retriever?,"  Howdy. 

I'm a brand new owner of a now 3 month old ""field line"" golden retriever. We are not hunters, just didn't realize goldens..were actually working dogs. Silly me. 

Anyway, I'm not gonna just force her to be a dog she isn't and it's clear already that she has some kind of prey drive or wants to go get birds. We got her from breeders that are hunters, and breed/train for huntin' dogs. 


So I'm wondering what kind of games/tasks are enriching for my ginger. Obviously fetch is a hit.. and I will be getting her a flirt pole. 

Is there anything else I can do to stimulate her retriever brain besides becoming an actual fowl hunter? Lol

Also, she loves to dig. The snuffle mats on Amazon seem lame, I tried one for my 2yo bichon and I just can't see how it's made for digging or even nose work. 



Should I be getting her toys that looks like birds? What do you think are some training/tasks techniques hunters use that I could use?",MetforminShits,2022-11-25,04:12:49,2022,11,25,4,12,Friday

Not too long ago I adopted a senior.  A tiny chi-minpin-whoknoes mix.  15 and blind, not very human-focused when I got her.  Over the last couple months she's changed a lot, for the better.  She's relaxed, affectionate and even playful.

Before her the smallest dog I'd ever owned was 80 lbs +.  Most of her behaviors I think I'm doing fine reading, except for her yawning. 

She will find me and sit at my feet, and sometimes paw at my leg to be picked up.  Often when I do pick her up, she will yawn multiple times when I start petting her.  When I set her down again, she'll do the ""shake off"" stress thing.

 I'm used to multiple or out-of-context yawns being a sign of stress.  She's older and has had a rough time of it (multiple homes etc etc). Just want to make sure it's not her being stressed or uncomfortable.",reugeneh,2022-11-24,13:02:25,2022,11,24,13,2,Thursday

0,DogAdvice,"Please help - just left vet but so scared, my dog can barely move","
I desperately need help. 
I have a 3 year old Aussie who has been having difficulty standing up from laying down for a few months. If I‚Äôm being honest I thought he maybe ran or played too hard and that it would pass. He was his normal self besides the struggle to get up, he was still eating and would play with me. Before all of this, I would come home he would be SO excited and jump up on me. Well now, I noticed he stopped jumping up on my bed, stopped jumping on me and barely shows excitement, and is still having major difficulty getting off the ground. Cut to now, he can barely get up, he sits slowly and oddly, he‚Äôs very slow when walking, and has no interest in fetch or playing. He seems absolutely exhausted and down, and never wants to get up. Nothing gets him excited and I can tell he is struggling so badly with something or in a lot of pain. I‚Äôve been thinking it was maybe arthritis or something similar. However he‚Äôs been to the vet (for allergies) during the time this has been happening and all of his tests and exams were normal. 

My pup has been with my mom who he stays with a lot and adores, and I just got home to see the obvious worsening of whatever is going on. Nothing has changed with his diet or routine except eating less. I immediately notice tonight that he is NOT well and rush him to the ER. You would think he was a very very old dog the way he moves and he was sitting very oddly with both legs pushed to the side. He could also barely get in my car which he never had issues jumping into. 

I explain this in way more detail to the vet. I tell her he is not hisself whatsoever and that I‚Äôve never seen him like this. She checked him out from head to toe and my dog didn‚Äôt express any pain in her checks of his body. I told her that he cried today when I was trying to examine his paws and she said he didn‚Äôt do that. Basically she said we can do a full body X-ray that would be absurdly expensive, or I go to an orthopedic specialist. I absolutely do not have 1500 to spare for X-rays, especially if that doesn‚Äôt show us what we‚Äôre looking for. I‚Äôm sobbing because seeing him like this is breaking my heart and I may have to find a way to do the X-rays asap because it‚Äôs eating me up inside. 

If this sounds remotely relatable to anyone, would you go the X-ray route first? Or maybe other testing? I do not know what to do or where to start especially knowing how expensive all of this will be. I really need some help or peace of mind. üíî",red1591,2022-11-24,11:57:34,2022,11,24,11,57,Thursday
0,DogAdvice,Dog acting weird and peeing inside?,"Okay so my German shepherd 1y/o was neutered two weeks ago and is still all cone'd up. He's on cone duty another week because he opened the wound a tiny bit the other day (Vet said it was fine, barely opened at all just enough to bleed a teeny bit, gave us antibiotics just in case). Now, we haven't gotten to play very much because he's only interested in playtime that involves running around and getting chased. He comes outside with me whenever I smoke (every hour or so) and we're out there 10, 15 minutes maybe, and he usually does his business then if he needs to. I've seen him hold it nearly an entire day (when we first got him a couple months ago, he was shy in the new home) too so I know he can.

Tonight I found a big ol' dump in the hallway. Like, so big you'd think a human left it there after hitting a buffet. After cleaning, he and I play fetch inside for a bit, since he's mostly healed. I discover a pee puddle that he must've left as a surprise for me earlier. I clean it up and close him out of the room while I do so. When I come out into the hallway guess who's standing over a nice fresh huge NEW puddle of pee? I can understand puddle #2 since he was all excited and I cut him off from playtime abruptly so he might not have been able to control myself, but with the pattern he established over the last few hours it has me concerned.

I also have a couple fish tanks sitting outside full of water to test they won't break. It's cold out, and they're covered in condensation. When I took him out with me like 20 minutes ago, he started nudging and rubbing his nose up against the side of one of the tanks and sort of stumbling side to side. I don't know what he was doing, he wasn't licking it. He might've been trying to check out a bug he saw or something, which would explain a lot because he might've just been stumbling trying to get closer to the bug with the cone in the way, but at the same time what if it's not that, you know? He's being good right now and sleeping in his favorite chair. 

Anyone have any ideas on why? Maybe he's just sick of the lack of stimulation since the neuter and he's acting out with the peeing/pooping inside? And the tank thing was just a bug he saw? Or could this be something more serious? We super duper can't afford to take him to the vet unless we're sure something's wrong, and he is acting normal now.",evildog69,2022-11-24,11:17:49,2022,11,24,11,17,Thursday

0,DogAdvice,Did my dog break her toe?,"We went on a rocky hike recently and then the next walk we went on she limped on that foot for only about 3 steps then has been walking, running, jumping letting me touch her leg and paw and overall seems completely unbothered.

Is it like when humans break a toe and there‚Äôs nothing you can do besides just slowly let it heal on its own? Or is it perhaps dislocated and needs to be reset?

She's a stray, mix of long-wire-haired daschund from what I manage to identify. 

She does this a lot of the time. During the day when she's on the sofa, or her bed. During the evening and the night. 
She seems healthy and without any issues on her teeth, gums, tongue, lips or mouth. 

Her foster parents from whom I took her told me that she was doing that when she was with them as well (they had her for almost 1 year)

Does anyone have any idea what this might be? 

She is not in pain or anything from what I see and I don't mind it at all. I got used to it and I'm even amused by this sometimes xD

It wasn‚Äôt anything too dramatic but just a small notice. There was 1 day she kept asking to go out which prompted the vet visit. 

Urinalysis found suspected bacteria &amp; we were given antibiotics. She toke them for 4 days until the urine culture came back negative in which I stopped. The vet said it was probably not a uti then. During this visit we also did a blood test and x rays but everything was normal except high bilirubin. 

We went back to do another blood test a week or two ago and it‚Äôs a different doctor this time (but the same clinic) who is going over the last visit. He mentions something the other vet didn‚Äôt which is my dogs urine has a pH of 9 which could indicate a uti. I opted not to do another urinalysis or urine culture because of what the other vet said and just process with blood work. It came back normal. Bilirubin levels were within range. 

These past few days, the drinking water has increased where it‚Äôs so noticeable. Few months ago even though I noticed a bit of an increase in intake of water, her pee was still yellow as usual. She generally doesn‚Äôt drink that much water anyways. Now it‚Äôs like light yellow to clear. And she‚Äôs peeing way more often on walks. She‚Äôs also gained a few pounds which the 2nd vet noticed.

Can I safely leave anything in the crate for him to make it a more positive experience? Or is it like training and sporadically give him treats?

I think part of the problem is this dog doesn't get walked much, so I'm going to be walking him at least twice a day, for at least an hour so hopefully that'll make things a little more easy.

I'm going to get him a nice bed to go there too because it's this safe place.

0,DogAdvice,Nervous/skittish dog help?,"I got my dog in late 2019, wanted to make sure she had all of her important vaccines before I started major socialization (I had plans of her going EVERYWHERE with me) and then Covid happened and I already worked from home. Now I have a 3 year old skittish pandemic puppy.

I've been taking her a lot more places for the past six months or so and she's doing a bit better and is less panicky. Occasionally, she's even excited to see some of my friends and immediately letting them pet her, but if I take her to my boyfriend's place (she's been around him about a dozen times) for a couple of days, she's still nervous the entire time, wants to put off eating, will only sleep if she's on the bed at my feet, etc. She's not panicked, but definitely uncomfy. (I should add that she was excited to see him this past time for the first evening we were there, by day two, she was nervous about him and his place again.)

I've came to terms with her never being the kind of dog that is fine with strangers petting her and most people accept it when I tell them she's skittish and won't let them touch her, but I do wish I could take her on outings without needing to focus so much attention on everyone and everything that's happening at once, because while I don't think she'll bite, I also don't want to set her up for failure either.

Am I doing mostly what I can here and just have to wait/hope for her to come around to new experiences a bit more? Or is there something else I can add in that will help?

0,DogAdvice,How can I help my parents mend the relationship between their willful dog and their curious grandson?,"My parents are both in their upper 60s and have a Soft-Coated Wheaton terrier (about 60 lbs) who is extremely willful. They have a shock collar on him, but he typically isn't deterred from bad behaviors due to inconsistent conditioning and probably sheer carelessness to just do what he wants. My 4.5 year old nephew is growing a bit scared of him, as the dog constantly barks and lurches toward him when my parents are babysitting. My nephew isn't scared when he's sitting with my parents in a chair, even if the dog is sniffing and licking his feet. The dog will constantly follow around my parents if they are carrying my nephew, sometimes jumping up to smell or lick my nephew. My nephew is at the age where he wants to run around our house with toys creating a ton of ruckus. This agitates/excites the dog. My parents have gates around the house which successfully sequester the dog and nephew. However, this usually leads to the dog watching right at the gate door (or running in between gate doors if my nephew is running around), incessantly barking until my nephew fully leaves the house.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel bad because the constant barking is stressful, but I don't know how to help my parents. While they definitely could be diligent with training my dog, a few trainers have called him ""the most willful dog they've ever seen"". I'm hoping to crowdsource some ideas on how my parents could find some peace in their home, but I also don't want my nephew to ""permanently"" have a scared dynamic with our dog. My parents would not rehome the dog. Also my sibling has a less intimidating/aggressive (but probably just as loud, more anxious) dog at home that gets along well with my nephew, so I do think there's potential for my nephew to like the dog.",barackpack,2022-11-23,04:37:32,2022,11,23,4,37,Wednesday
0,DogAdvice,my senior foster pup might have cushings disease (i think he 100% does..),"i guess this is just a discussion, but im open to advice and if anyone knows anything about it from experience or knowledge. 
(Picture: Snoopy is the big boy, Annie is the little lady!) 

my family and i are fostering (soon to adopt) a senior beagle, he‚Äôs 11, and his name is allegedly  ‚ÄúSnoopy.‚Äù unfortunately we have little to no information on him, all we know is that his previous owner passed away and the family of the owner wanted to euthanize him. however, in their care, they neutered him at 10 years old. that is all we know about him. from our experience, he is VERY affectionate, he is overweight, he has severe separation anxiety, and he does not respond to his name/commands/sounds. 

we took him to VetCo (petco‚Äôs vet, we do not recommend) because we weren‚Äôt able to get him into our personal vet yet. anyways, after weeks with that vet, we finally switched and got him into our personal vet. our vet was concerned about Cushing‚Äôs disease, and the previous vet had mentioned it too.. because he checks off all the boxes on the symptoms. on top of that, he has chronic ear infections, hearing loss, a heart murmur, and a distant heartbeat (vet said that it‚Äôs hard to hear it? it sounds far away‚Ä¶ possibly due to him panting  or obesity). we will also have to do a chest X-ray to ensure his lungs and heart are alright. 

i love this dog, he is the sweetest. we put down about $600 or more in vet bills so far, and we plan to put down more to get him tested for Cushing‚Äôs disease and X-ray. once they test him, we can get the medication to help give him a quality of life. we are also giving him CBD oil 1-2x daily to help him calm down because his anxiety. 

it just saddens me, knowing that we are going to adopt a dog who‚Äôs already a senior, and who‚Äôs life could be cut short due to a variety of different reasons. i am also sad because we have another senior beagle, Annie, who is 14 years old too. i know that beagles life expectancy is usually 12-15 years‚Ä¶ and my heart breaks just to think about this all.",Mental_Strawberry_,2022-11-23,04:37:22,2022,11,23,4,37,Wednesday

0,DogAdvice,Lung mass in Pomeranian puppy,"My mum has a 10 month old Pomeranian. She‚Äôs had a hacking type cough for a few months (usually when she gets excited). We took her to a vet who gave some medication which showed some improvement until it ran out.

Other than the coughing she is perfectly healthy, happy and has not acted abnormal at all. She‚Äôs very cheery and super friendly, and the vet said her physical exam was perfect.

If the vet has ruled out cancer, is there anything else it could that‚Äôs life threatening?

0,DogAdvice,Ongoing Digestive Issues,"My English Springer Spaniel Roxy (8 years old, female) has been having ongoing digestive issues for about 2 months now. We've been back and forth to the vet many times. This all started around September 25th.

It started out as painful gas. She would cry and pace for an hour to 2 hours. Eventually I'd get her to settle, put the heating pad on her belly and she would pass some really smelly farts and then just go to sleep. It was progressively becoming more frequent so we knew she needed to get into the vet. We called the vet and the first appointment was 2 weeks out. But they prescribed us a probiotic and recommended trying Beano over the counter with dinner and told us to try a bland diet of Chicken and Rice in the meantime.

Then we finally went to her appointment and got her bloodwork and a stool sample analyzed. Stool sample was normal, bloodwork only showed her Phosphate level was a little low, not really conclusive of anything. Vet prescribed a prescription diet Purina Gastro EN and said we could also use Gas X whenever she had an episode. We were slowly transitioning to the new diet and things were looking better. We only had about 3 gas episodes during the transition rather than every single night and whenever an episode was coming on we would give her Gas X and it would resolve in a half hour. So we learned how to treat it, but not what's causing it.

We scheduled an abdominal ultrasound. We lost our last dog really suddenly and wanted to be sure this wasn't something serious. Meanwhile the day before the ultrasound we had almost finished transitioning to the new diet, but suddenly she has diarrhea. So we go back to chicken and rice. She fluctuated between bouts of bad diarrhea and semi solid stool, we are now on day 4 of diarrhea. We have tried fasting for 12 hours. Then small frequent meals of chicken and rice. On day 3 we also added a spoonful of pumpkin. Probiotics in the morning, beano at night. Today we returned to the vet for repeat bloodwork and they gave us Flagyl for the diarrhea. Meanwhile my dad and I also had terrible diarrhea as well. So it's possible that it's a diarrhea bug that we all caught and is actually a separate issue from the gas..

It's a huge relief that her ultrasound was normal and didn't show a tumor or anything. But I'm also frustrated that we have no real answers for what's going on with Roxy. She's lost 7 pounds. I'm frustrated that everyone just keeps telling me to keep doing what I'm doing. I'm frustrated that I called the vet over and over and Roxy had to have diarrhea for four days before someone finally prescribed something. I'm hopeful that we can get her stable and that this is a bug and all she needed was a different diet. I love this dog so much.. I'm exhausted. I've spent so many nights up with her with either diarrhea or gas. Everytime I take her out I'm so anxious that she's gonna have more diarrhea.",devouringbooks23,2022-11-23,02:54:47,2022,11,23,2,54,Wednesday

0,DogAdvice,Spin-Cycle Overload,"We have recently adopted a second GSD from the shelter (\~2 months ago). At first, the dog (we named him Dog) was acclimating well, learning new tricks and easily house trained. Three weeks ago today, we noticed Dog start to spin while sniffing the ground (bi-directional) and let out a high pitch bark when he completed the turn (not tail chasing). This coincided with the installation of our sod grass that day as well as switching to a new food: Inukshuk. We have tried changing his food back to what he had before the switch to no avail (Orijen Original). A couple days before onset, he finished a month long regimen of Doxycycline for heartworms. Since then, and truly over the course of the first 1-2 days, the behavior has increased in frequency to nearly all day except when he is sleeping. If he goes outside, we cannot distract him from this behavior (balls/ physically trying to move him, etc), and he also pulls up clumps of grass during the spins with his mouth. We are afraid to let him outside because of the noise + destroying our new grass. Indoors, he also spins, yips, and licks the floor/drags his teeth on the flooring while spinning. Sometimes a ball will distract him indoors for a few minutes while he chews on it, but most often he will run to a ball or a toy and then spin cycle once he reaches the ball. He used to have a solid ‚Äúcome,‚Äù but he now ignores it while spin-cycling. His vocalizations have also increased to constant, be it whining anxiously or high-pitched yapping most hours of the day. For example, he used to be very calm/happy during a car ride, and you can see in the video I‚Äôve attached anxious vocalizing.   


He is going to the vet next week for a blood panel + heartworm injection. We have called them a couple times about the spin-cycle, and their advice was to redirect, and we have been dedicated to doing so, but it‚Äôs nearly impossible at this point to really distract him from the spin-cycle at all, or at least distract him constantly all day. We fortunately both work from home, so we can rule out separation anxiety, and we have the capacity to work with him more than most would be able to. He does this in the crate as well, but instead of licking he digs at the pad.   


All of this is to say, we are desperate for any insights, hearing from those with similar experiences, or advice.

My small dog has HGE. I found out earlier yesterday when he came back from being outside and big drops of blood trailed behind him on the sheet of my bed, I went outside to look at his stool to see if something he ate cut him a little, but his stool looked like jam and was bloody diarrhea.

0,DogAdvice,My dog likes outside more than inside,"Obviously my dog is an outside dog. but she has separation anxiety, so she will bark when she wants attention. I train and get her tired and she barely barks during the day until its time to eat dinner. she sometimes wants it early it seems. Thats not the problem though, she is quieter than the other dogs in our neighborhood that are around us and the most behaved big/medium dog on leash.

problem: she likes being outside more than in her crate at night.

explain: when it was warmer i'd have to pet her and then she'd get up to come in and be just fine during the night in her kennel, i dont force her in, she just walks into it with guidence.

now that its cold, we obviously dont want her to freeze outside. she has a dog enclosure she can safely be in with access always to water, a bed, and an igloo. when we bring her in for the night, she goes in as usual and then after a few moments of letting us sleep she starts whinning and barking. at first you'd think ""she just needs water"" or ""she needs a potty break."" well we did both of those, she didnt take the water (when she was a pup she tended to have water at night when she barked which is why i trued it this time) and she went pee. we bring her back in and then a few minutes later she is barking again. we eventually put her outside in the doggy pen and she goes right to sleep on her outside bed, then she wakes up whinning a bit (i assume she forgot it was cold outside til she woke up) and then she goes into her kennel and sleeps the rest of the night perfectly fine.

if we have an anxiety collar from the vet on her, she is better at night inside.

we dont want her to be cold outside. so we prefer her to be inside, but in the last 2 days, she prefers outside. we are working on getting a heating dog bed for her so she isnt cold but it would be nice to know is warmer inside.

her anxiety collar lasts 1 month so after that we have to schedule another, in between those days we dont want to be kept up all night trying to calm her down.

clarify: We do NOT want her outside in the cold. *she* chooses it.

anything we could do?

note: she is 8 yrs old, a Rottweiler, and she has had past seizures due to a mold allergy (affected us too. we moved since then) so the vet said we gotta be careful of the anxiety meds. she had us try some and it gave her a seizure so we stopped and the anxiety collar works great, no seizures.",MandosOtherALT,2022-11-22,12:58:43,2022,11,22,12,58,Tuesday

0,DogAdvice,extremely dominant and aggressive dog,"Hello, I hope someone can help me or give me some advice.. 

I try to make it short and sum everything up.  

My dog is extremely dominant towards other dogs and horribly territorial, I really think that this is an extreme case. I adopted him over a year ago , he‚Äòs 2 years old , castrated and 17 pounds (tiny) , don‚Äòt know his breed, he‚Äòs a mix, but really really beautiful and cute and looks like an angel actually but if he gets angry, he turns into a devil. 

The first months were horrible, he became more and more reactive, went totally crazy when we came close to other dogs, he barked at everything and got aggressive towards me in those moments of rage. I was so so desperate, we live in the city and there are so many dogs here, it was impossible to avoid them completely. Going on a walk with him was horrible, at home I spent my time watching videos and reading stuff etc, I was so exhausted.. i couldn‚Äòt afford a dog trainer or anything so I had to do it on my own, I tried several stuff from counter conditioning, worked a lot with treats, in the end I did a mixture of everything and it got better with time.. 

so now I can go on a walk with him and actually enjoy it (at least most of the time). He gets alonh well with little dogs , females in general , he‚Äòs extremely dominant though and also insecure, sometimes even anxious towards little dogs which is absurd, because when he see‚Äòs a bigger male dog (not castrated worst case) he gets totally wild and its difficult for me to control him. 
In most cases I can handle him very well but there is particularly one dog which is his hate object nr 1 and he becomes this evil rage machine , it‚Äòs really scary actually. I can‚Äòt call it aggression because it doesn‚Äòt describe it at all. In that state I cannot do much. I tell him to STOP It, try to make him sit, making eye contact , which works with other dogs that he doesn‚Äôt like but not with his hate objects (that one dog and especially huskies) Even when the dog is not in sight anymore he marks the ground like crazy , growling at the same time, raised hair from neck to tail‚Ä¶ 

today we had this encounter in the morning, he went wild, I tried but couldn‚Äòt control him, he bit me in the leg. I was so angry and so sad because I thought that we passed that shit already, it was a huge relapse. most people find it funny when he gets angry because he‚Äòs little and cute , he always has this beauty bonus. In the first months I always tried to find excuses for this behaviour(he‚Äòs traumatized etc , he was abandoned) but I think it‚Äòs his extremely dominant attitude which has nothing to do with the past. On the other hand he‚Äòs the cutest dog, he really is. 

What is really concerning for me is the level of rage and aggression , he goes from 0 to 10000, it also happened that he got along well with a dog and all of a sudden he got mad and attacked the other dog without any warning. He‚Äôs so unpredictable and I‚Äôm afraid that he could seriously harm another dog. Of course other owners find it funny because ‚Äúcute little dog gets angry‚Äú ‚Äúdon‚Äòt worry, it‚Äòs ok‚Äú.. no it‚Äòs not. another big problem is the vet. We were three (!!!) people trying to control and hold him for one vaccine. I don‚Äòt know what happens if he gets ill and needs treatment ‚Ä¶ even the vets said it to me ‚Äúthis is not normal. We have seen extrem cases of nervous and anxious dogs at the vet.‚Äú 

I tried to get him used to a muzzle, we trained that but he gets paralized as soon as he wears it, he wouldn‚Äòt move .. i don‚Äòt think that wearing a muzzle is the solution, I wish it was. He also rejects any kind of collar, he turns into a depressed thing, he only wears a harness for walks. Don‚Äòt know what he went through and why he hates other dogs so much. 
At home he‚Äòs cute and I‚Äòm happy with him, he sleeps at his place, no begging at the table (of course he tries but he goes back to his place when I tell him) , no destruction or aggression problems, he waits for my commando to start eating , no extrem barking only when excited for something.. one vet said to me that I should not give him affection, no petting, no cuddling, only one place for him, all rooms forbidden, basically only nos nos nos.. i mean, this is not the solution right? We have rules, like I wrote above, but I don‚Äòt think that something would change for the better if I stopped petting him. 

I hope this wasn‚Äòt too much.. it would be nice to hear other experiences , maybe someone knows something, I would appreciate that alot! Thank you!!",gale_weathers,2022-11-22,10:19:02,2022,11,22,10,19,Tuesday

0,DogAdvice,OTC treatment for moist dermatitis in palliative dog,"Hi! 

My parents have an elderly shih tzu with heart failure, and while she's on medication for that, the plan is to let her go peacefully on her own time. Taking her to the vet upsets her so much that they just automatically refill her meds for her without visits, since the clinic doesn't do tele visits

She isn't fat but has this big fold on her butt, right above her tail, and from the smell and look of it, it seems to be moist dermatitis. While I'm visiting them, I'm gently drying the fold when I can, but I'm at a loss as to what kind of otc powder I can get for her. The vet won't prescribe anything without seeing her, I can't find anyone who will see a new patient over telehealth, and the only experience I have with this was resolved with Neo-Predef powder.

0,DogAdvice,Dog ear tip is bleeding,"Hello, 

My dog (1.5 year old hound mix) has had on/off scabbing on the tip of his ear for the past few months. At first, I dismissed it as a simple nip from another dog that he plays with, but it seems to reoccur in the same location on the same ear. He is not an outdoor dog, and is up to date on all his vaccines and heartworm + tick meds. 

The spot is small, about 4-5mm across, and bleeds occasionally. When it is scabbed over, it is a hard, crystal-like feeling that is noticeable. Additionally, my dog yelps a bit if I handle the scab. 

I cleaned it up with soap and water, and got these pics: https://imgur.com/a/jqBodtL

0,DogAdvice,How to start my dog in daycare?,"I have a 3 year lab/cattle dog mix. She is THE sweetest, kind, easygoing dog. However she doesn‚Äôt play fetch with any toy I tried, she doesn‚Äôt play with other toys she has, the two things she likes are dog parks (even then she is picky with the dogs there) or playing/running/walking with me. I usually walk her 3 miles a day and take her to the park for min an hour on top of that. However with winter coming up and daylight savings time, it‚Äôs now dark when we wake up and dark when I get home, I tried the dog park but there‚Äôs nobody there after sunset, and to top it off coyotes have been coming into the city and I‚Äôm scared to venture far in the dark. As it is, I can‚Äôt tire her and while she is a good girl and doesn‚Äôt destroy anything while I‚Äôm at work, I wanna make her as happy as possible and I see how full of energy she is on our walks.

So I finally caved in, did my research and found a good daycare. But I don‚Äôt know how to go about this. My dog and I have never been really apart, I occasionally ask friends to dogsit her but always at my place. She is very uncomfortable in new environments, twice we did sleepovers at a friend‚Äôs house and she was very agitated in the evening to go home, she even peed on the carpet and didn‚Äôt ‚Äòspeak to me‚Äô the whole time. If we go on a day visit and I leave the room/house briefly (to go to the car for example) she barks and cries and tries her hardest to follow me. I know once she gets used to the daycare she‚Äôll have a blast. As a puppy she had a lot of separation anxiety. So I don‚Äôt want to just take her to the daycare and leave her there and trigger something day 1. I don‚Äôt want her to feel abandoned.

0,DogAdvice,"Looking for general tips on how to resolve a situation with a neighbor, train my dog better, and know my rights with animal control.","Hello, so I have a 30lb dog that lives in an apartment complex. He is generally sweet and well behaved but he is a territorial barker and doesn‚Äôt really understand why so many people live right outside of our house. He has never attempted to bite anyone but he can sound very scary when he barks. He will pull on the leash and bark. We have has a few run ins with the next door neighbor and us leaving at the exact same time because our doors are 2 feet apart. 

Anyways she is fed up and scared of him even though he‚Äôs never done anything- she is claiming he‚Äôs tried to bite her on multiple occasions and reporting animal control because she claims we have no control over him. In my opinion this is just a straight up lie, but I could imagine how an aggressive sounding dog that we are holding on the leash might seem like he‚Äôs ‚Äútrying to bite‚Äù when he‚Äôs pulling towards you. We have introduced them in the past and he always tries to hide behind us when she gets close. 

Regardless though, I want to be a better neighbor and curb my dogs excessive barking and territorial attitude because I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs obnoxious as hell for everyone. Currently we do some treat training where we calmly sit him down and close his mouth and give a treat when he settles down, but it is not working fast enough.

0,DogAdvice,What should I do about my dog over the holidays?,"TL;DR leave my dog at an Airbnb close by, doggie daycare, or leave him at home but he‚Äôll be alone for longer periods of time. 


Christmas is coming up and I‚Äôm still trying to figure out what would be the best way to take care of my dog while at family gatherings. Will be going to one family function on Christmas Eve, and another on Christmas Day. They are both close to each other, but far enough from my house that we will likely be staying over at my mom‚Äôs house for the two days.



My dog is quite well behaved when visiting other people, but can‚Äôt go to the Christmas Eve gathering because they have cats, and he can‚Äôt come to the Christmas Day because my sister has pretty bad allergies and a small baby, and is also scared of Coop a bit (he‚Äôs very sweet but very big and very hairy). I could probably fight to bring him but I don‚Äôt want my sister to be uncomfortable at Christmas.



Anyway, I‚Äôm not really sure what I‚Äôm going to do with my dog. He is really good 99% of the time, but will sometimes steal something and resource guard it, so I don‚Äôt feel comfortable leaving him at a daycare. We once got a friend to watch him for a week while we were on vacation and he was so bad, that my friend was literally scared of him and we had to get a family member pick him up midweek. (Had a different friend watch him once but that friend I guess was experienced with resource guarding so was able to handle it). But it seems like he acts up when he‚Äôs with unfamiliar people in an unfamiliar place. He usually is watched by my partners family when we go away (he grew up with them in that house so they never have any trouble) but they are going to be at the Christmas Eve gathering, and will have their own thing on Christmas Day. 



My mom has offered to watch him while we are away for Christmas Eve, but then I‚Äôll still need to find somewhere for him to go on Christmas Day. 



Options are: I have booked a dog friendly Airbnb near my mom‚Äôs house that we could bring him to so we can easily go and visit / walk him a few times that day. Im just worried he will be really stressed in an unfamiliar house by himself and destroy something (he‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt had separation anxiety at our house). 



Or we leave him at our place and just go home each night but Coop will be by himself for two full days and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs really fair for him. 



There are also ‚Äúdoggie suites‚Äù in my mom‚Äôs area, sort of like a daycare, but alone. But you have to do a consultation as well as a ‚Äúdoggie daycare trial‚Äù, so we‚Äôd have to get that done before the holidays start. 



Ideally, my mom‚Äôs friend lives practically next door and we could potentially leave Coop there (she has a dog as well so it‚Äôs all dog proofed), but only if she is away for Christmas because while our dogs do get along, it‚Äôs still always a risk with two dogs in the same house. But it would be so nice if we could use her house because we could pop in and out super easily throughout the day and my family loves a Christmas walk.

0,DogAdvice,Introducing new puppy (4 mos) to my dog (5 y/o),"We brought a puppy home during the first week of November. She's a Shih Tzu who came from a kennel, before being brought to the province where we went to get her. We decided to bring our 5 y/o dog (who's a Shih Tzu too) so they can meet at a neutral place. 

At home, the puppy often bumps into our Shih Tzu, runs towards her, and signals that she wants to play. Our Shih Tzu always runs away and asks my mom to carry her away from the puppy. Sometimes she goes up to my parents' room and hides just so the puppy won't find her. Do you have any tips on how they can get along better and how we can get our Shih Tzu to warm up to the puppy?",ResponsibleCharity36,2022-11-21,16:10:02,2022,11,21,16,10,Monday

0,DogAdvice,a doggie got hurt,"i dog sit at my home every now and then as a side hustle. i‚Äôve recently started because i just moved into a home with a fenced in backyard. i have pet sitting insurance that i recently acquired as well. 
i‚Äôm watching my friends 2 dogs, 1 of which has known my dog for many years and they have played together a few times in the past. she asked me to watch her dogs while she goes out of town for holiday. 
earlier, i was supervising them in the backyard. they all have a similar energy level and play pretty rough. they were rolling around on top of each other, and suddenly one is bleeding profusely and i can‚Äôt tell from where. nothing malicious happened at all. turns out, the tip of the one dogs ear was cut, maybe from a nail or a tooth that was flailing around (like i said there was no malicious chomping action). dog ears are all veins and capillaries so the bleeding is intense and never ending. at first when i cleaned her up it was just a little nick, not even a CM long. she continued to fuss with it and shake her head every time i tried to clean it, thus opening it more, and eventually splitting it. i bought things to slow the bleeding and wrap it up, and put a cone on her. i‚Äôm taking her to the vet first thing in the morning and it‚Äôs going to cost me around $300. she‚Äôs not in any pain, seemingly, but i feel terrible. this has never happened before and it was a freak accident. i have kept the owner informed and she isn‚Äôt upset with me at all, she knows her dogs play rough and she mentioned she was surprised they hadn‚Äôt hurt each other before. 
is there anything i‚Äôm missing here that i need to do? will my pet sitting insurance reimburse me for the vet fees?",veronicadelafakaaa,2022-11-21,14:01:56,2022,11,21,14,1,Monday

0,DogAdvice,Four year old dog suddenly acting out?,"
We have a four year old Shiba Inu named Chai. We have had him since he was 8 weeks old, and he is generally a very good boy. Of course, being a shiba, he has his ‚Äòquirks,‚Äô but when it comes to training and behavior, he has been a very good boy for four years now. 

He has also usually shown to be very adaptable. We have moved a couple of times since we got him, and he has also adapted through a lot of job/routine changing. He has always readjusted extremely quickly and well, honestly he‚Äôs really a trooper. 

But, out of nowhere ( for him ), he‚Äôs starting to act out. I‚Äôd like to ask you all to keep open and understanding minds as you read this! And know that I have years of experience with dog owning and training, and I know ‚Äòobjective‚Äô solutions for some of the issues we‚Äôre having ‚Äî im just a little stressed and overwhelmed and wondering if anyone has any constructive insight!

We recently moved again, about two months ago now. And in fact, the place we moved into provides a much nicer situation for Chai. And as he usually does, he adjusted very very quickly to the new place! He was doing amazing. 

Until I started my new job, about three weeks ago. Before this, I worked a full time job, and Chai was very used to being in a crate when I was at work ‚Äî my new job is no different. 

But since the very first night after starting my new job, Chai has been whining in his crate. He has /never/, truly never, done that before. Not even a couple years ago when our life was extremely unstable and we had almost no routine. Now, we are stable, and we do have routine ‚Äî but Chai seems to have almost regressed? 

Since my fianc√© is at home most of the time, Chai pretty much only has to be crated at night. I wait until the last possible minute before I go to bed to put him in there, giving him as much time outside of the crate as I can. He usually doesn‚Äôt go to bed til at least 1 am. I‚Äôll even stay up later than I should just for his sake, since he suddenly hates being in there so much. He whines immediately when he goes in, and goes on for about an hour or so. And then, he whines again at like five in the morning, and continues to do so off and on until I get up. 

I‚Äôve tried getting up to let him go potty, and then locking him back up, and he‚Äôll keep whining, so I know that isn‚Äôt the problem. 

And again, this only started when I started working again. For the first month in the new house, he didn‚Äôt make a peep in his crate, no fuss whatsoever ‚Äî which is his normal. But now he‚Äôs not only keeping himself awake with the whining, but he‚Äôs disturbing our sleep too, and I work a very mentally and physically exhausting job ‚Äî needless to say, I‚Äôm definitely getting frustrated and confused. And very tired lol. 

Today, he has absolutely blown my mind with a new ‚Äòregression.‚Äô We use the Place command for him for when we aren‚Äôt able to supervise him ‚Äî if one of us is nearby and can keep sort of an eye on him, he does as he pleases. But when we‚Äôre preoccupied and in a different part of the house, we put him on Place. Just like with his crate, he has always been an extremely good boy for years about this. He has always seemed to even enjoy the routine, he gets excited to go on Place and he loves to curl up and snooze. 

But today, he has broken Place /four/ times in a row. The first time I wrote off as a fluke, thought maybe he needed to pee, but I still put him back on Place and released him myself, let him outside for a while, and then put him back. 

A few minutes later, I heard the clicking of his claws on the floor, and I was a little flabbergasted. He really /never/ does this. I put him back on Place. 

This has happened two more times. He doesn‚Äôt seem to be attempting to do anything specific when he gets up, like he isn‚Äôt going to the door to get out, he isn‚Äôt sniffing around the kitchen like he does when he‚Äôs hungry. He‚Äôs just trotting around or lying on the couch or something aimless. 

I know I‚Äôve rambled on, and I know, being a dog group, people will have some most likely strong, owner-attacking opinions üíö ( I‚Äôve worked with dogs and dog people for over ten years, and I know how dog people are ‚Äî especially on the internet! ) I just ask, again, that you guys try to understand that I know my dog, I know how to work with dogs, and I know logical solutions to these problems. I‚Äôm just struggling to understand where they‚Äôre coming from. I have never ever expected a ‚Äòperfect‚Äô dog, there‚Äôs no such thing, and I‚Äôve always been very understanding of the misbehaviors he has normally has throughout his life. But these new things, his very sudden crate training and place training regressions, are important things and they‚Äôre very tiring. If this were a new dog, or a dog I didn‚Äôt know, or a dog who I know has had bad experiences with these things ( etc ), it would make a lot more sense to me. But Chai has only ever known crate and place training, and if anything, those two routines have been the more consistently stable things that he knows!",isaaczephyr,2022-11-21,11:12:54,2022,11,21,11,12,Monday

But she is extremely needy. Likes to jump on us to get attention. Regardless of what we're doing at the moment. She also playfully nips at our feet, shoes and sometimes arms. She's intense. 

The trainer suggested this wire pen and it's been pretty useful. The idea is to keep her settled in one place during times we can't play with her. She goes in willingly but whines once whatever treat we lured her in with is finished.

I feel for her and care for her, but she's EXHAUSTING. Hoping we eventually alter her behavior enough so that either we can keep her or get her placed in a loving home.",DefinitelyNot2050,2022-11-21,08:52:51,2022,11,21,8,52,Monday

0,DogAdvice,Are these things I should develop a training plan for?,"I've only had experience with an extremely reactive dog so I want to make sure I'm not overkill for this pup. And learn the difference between ""eh this is a minor issue I shouldn't micromanage"" and ""this is a real issue that should be tackled proactively."" 

We go on solo walks all the time and I introduce her to other people and other dogs. She's a little nervous around dogs but LOVES people. But sometimes she'll see (not meet) one person and just decide she doesn't like them. She doesn't pull or lunge. Just a clear sort of ""stay away from me"" bark. But it's so rare. Not even once a day that I'm confused on how to handle it. It's not even the same look, race, gender or clothing that sets her off though they trend more towards elderly women. And not even the same person every time. I've kinda of just let it slide as far as training. I apologize and we'll move to the side to let that person go through. Dogs are beings too right? They're gonna just not like someone sometimes like I do. But because she locks onto that person she doesn't like, it spooks them a bit. She'll do her one warning barking and then as they walk past she'll bark a 2-3 time more if I don't redirect her. Again, no lunging or anything. I often use treats to break her attention. But is that the best option? Because I am unsure how I can decrease her random, yet infrequent reactivity and make her more comfortable.

Final thing is her ""confirmation"" barking. She's otherwise very quiet and I live in an apartment. She sleeps in the bed with me and when I give her the command to come up to the bed at night, she does a single loud bark and comes over. Like a ""okay I hear you."" or ""On my way!"" thing. I'm worried it may wake up the neighbor in the middle of the night. During the day she doesn't confirmation bark like that. I don't get it.

0,DogAdvice,"Abused Dog, AC Won‚Äôt Help","There is a very large family around the corner from my daughter‚Äôs house that got a large breed puppy about 6 months ago. From the day they brought the dog home, it has been locked alone in an outdoor enclosure. He/she is never taken out of this 6‚Äôx6‚Äô enclosure. One side is chain link, and it is covered by a roof but still exposed to the elements due to the chain link side. 

My daughter and her GF tried speaking to the family there, but a language barrier prevented any meaningful dialogue, and they were eventually told to leave. They then called animal control, who came out and checked on the dog, and then told my daughter that because the dog had food, water, and shelter, and was not chained for extended periods of time that there was nothing they could do. 

I‚Äôve walked past this poor animal while walking my daughter‚Äôs dog and it breaks my heart. He/she whines piteously and claws endlessly at the cement beneath the chain link gate.

However, mentally I am certain the dog is in unbearable anguish. It hurts me physically and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

0,DogAdvice,How to correct my dog when she charges and barks at people.," Hi  everyone. I have a two-year-old lab. She's a wonderful dog. She was a  joy to train and i feel that I have very clear lines of communication  with her. She has a very balanced temperament (even though she was a  little timid in her first year) and handles 98 percent of interactions,  both with humans and dogs, very well. She has never bitten or shown  signs of aggression in any form other than what i describe below. She  also has a pretty rock solid recall. All in all, a very well-behaved and  good-natured lab. Not untypical.

However, lately a problem has emerged and i don't really understand what causing it or what to do about it when it happens.

I  should say firstly for context that i'm from the UK and this happens  while off lead in the park. In UK parks, it's generally permitted and  understood that dogs will be off lead. There are very few dog specific  parks. The park in question is very, very large.

In  short - Very occasionally, she will charge and bark at people. I know  that she would never attack, but of course the people on the receiving  end do not. She has a pretty scary bark and when she bares her teeth I  appreciate that she could be pretty frightening. She will charge and  stop 5 feet from them, take the space, hackles up and intensely bark a  few times and then return to me. It strikes me very much as 'get away  from us!'. When it happens, she ignores her 'Stop' command (which  usually makes her stop and sit immediately) and ignores her recall  command. This usually all happens in 5 seconds or so.

I've  noticed a few common triggers - People who are concealed and then  reveal themselves, for example, from behind a tree. Also people who are  behaving erratically. Occasionally (and hugely embarrassingly) people  whose faces are covered with veils. It also happens when people have bad  energies. For example, sometime i will spot someone a little physically  intimidating or something walking towards us and even though i don't   change my behaviour or signal my nervousness to her, she picks out the  same person and barks.

I think  there is a logic to it from her perspective. It seems pretty defensive  in nature. However, in my book, this is unacceptable and there is no  excuse. Especially to ignore her stop and recall commands.

Do any of you guys have any thoughts on what this new behaviour might be about and how to best deal with it when it occurs?

Thanks so much.

0,DogAdvice,Should I be socializing my 2mo and 2yo old? 2mo bites too much.,"Recently got a 2month old golden retriever, I have a 2 year old Bichon who is admittedly not socialized but is other wise very well behaved save for some of the basic commands we just never taught her. 

2 year old has never dealt with other pups besides her littermates, obviously. I don't know what her relationship was like with her mom or the backyard breeders we got her from.


2 month old comes from what seemed to be reputable breeders, they checked off most of the ""ethical breeder"" checklist. The breeder warned us that Golden is ""anti-social"" and likes to have her own space. She seemed worried we wouldn't like that and really encouraged us to get the other pup. 


Personally, I don't see any insecurity or aggressive habits in this new puppy. She is just a typical puppy with shark teeth and learning boundaries. She is quiet ""introverted"" , however, and regularly get irritated with our Bichon being too close. 


Bichon is usually high energy during playtime, darts around and wants to go hard. So for a while we had to remove *her* because she was overwhelming pup. 

Now, it's the Golden we have to keep separated from Bichon because all she wants to do is *bite*. My Bichon has completely kept a distance, sits with my husband or in another corner and is incredibly tolerant of Golden when she does get a hold of her tail or lip. 



They do want to play at times. But I feel like I can't let them because Bichon will just get bitten. It's like the first thing my Golden wants to do.. and I don't know that my Bichon has it in her to ""correct"" or teach bite inhibition because I can't let them play for longer than two seconds. 

My Bichon has actually gotten an *eye* infection because Golden always goes for the eyes.


Like, I don't think I can let them even sniff each other unless they are about to go to sleep. 

Am I hindering behavioral development and their relationship if I keep them separated at all times? My Bichon wouldn't hurt the Golden, I'm worried she'll lose an eye. 

I do try to play with Bichon separately but she is just SO obsessed with Golden that she won't play with me. 

What could I be doing wrong here? Should I just keep them separated until pup is older?

0,DogAdvice,Post-op amputation rescue,"Hello all. Yesterday, my wife and I brought home a foster-to-adopt rescue. She is an 8-10 month old Anatolian Shepard who is 16 days post-op single rear leg amputation. She was found as a stray and transferred to the local SPCA where they determined her rear leg injury was irreparable and required amputation at the hip. We were told that they also performed a Spay procedure prior to the amputation. They did not send us home with any pain medication for her which I found odd, as I can only imagine she is still hurting. We did get Trazedone but from my understanding, that has no pain-killing effect and only serves to keep her calm. She has displayed anywhere from mild to moderate aggression towards my wife and one of our other dogs. All were seemingly random woth no common themes as to what would cause it. My wife tried adjusting her e-collar prior to bed and she gave a defensive bark and a attempted snap. That was the worse aggression display thus far with the other being mild towards my other dog. He will be minding his own business and she will start quietly growling as if she's just annoyed he's there. She has yet to show any aggression towards me or our other, oldest dog. 
My question is, do you think this is because she is in pain still? I can only imagine so but this is our first time having any issues with an adoption or foster process.",rcooper890,2022-11-21,01:28:46,2022,11,21,1,28,Monday

0,DogAdvice,Questions about playing rough and neck safety,"Some context about my dog Buttercup who is the predominant cause for this post; she's a Pitbull-Boxer mix with some other stuff in there somewhere, about 6~7yrs old, and the sweetest dog ever when it comes to people, other dogs, and cats. We've had her since she was 2yrs old and she was a mommy before we adopted her.

Her favorite game is playing Tug of War, especially when you get competitive and make her fight for it and play keep away. Ever since I've started playing Tug with her, (when I was 14 and we had just gotten her) to this day, I've slowly become more and more rough and competitive when playing with her. I don't mean that as in being mean to her, but rather, making it harder for her to ""win"" and play fighting. While playing, I'll frequently shove her around, pick her up and swing her via her holding onto the toy, and get her in face growling and wrestling with her. She has never ever intentionally HURT me while playing like this, only nipped at my hand accidentally or lightly (didn't break skin or truly BITE me) when I really deserved it.

I wanted to make this post because I'm wondering if it's safe to play with her like this. Soon as we stop playing, she'll be sweet and gentle as always, and she seems to genuinely enjoy the rough housing and competition. But is there any chance playing with her like this could be teaching her to be aggressive, even when it seems like she's having fun and still sweet as always? And I'm also concerned if there's any chance giving her a tough time and doing stuff like swinging her up into the air while she holds onto the toy has any chance of causing any serious harm to her neck, teeth or spine. I love playing rough with her and me and her both seem to genuinely enjoy it, but if it might hurt her or cause her to become aggressive I'd like to tone it down.

TLDR; I play rough with my Pitbull-Boxer and she seems to have fun and remain the sweetest dog ever, but I want to ask if it's bad to do this and if it could possibly injure her.",JustJouy,2022-11-20,23:24:23,2022,11,20,23,24,Sunday

I have two dogs of working breed. I have had them since they were 3 months old and raised them to be very social at the dog park. They did well socially but earlier this year they spent about 6 months with my dad's dog who would chew them up and bully them. Since getting them back, they are very quick to snap if other dogs get into their face and try to bite strangers patting them on the lead.

These are behaviours they didn't used to display. I think they've experienced trauma and I want to help them get comfortable with greeting new dogs again.

0,DogAdvice,Extremely reactive/anxious dog - feel like I‚Äôm running out of options. Please help!,"Apologies for the long post. My dog (14 month old Romanian rescue) is constantly over threshold when outside, as in he will bark at nothing, whine, lunge and growl on a constant basis. He‚Äôs aggressive towards dogs and people. No aggression issues with visitors to the home. Generally speaking, he‚Äôs content in the home (apart from barking). I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say he will spin and bark at the top of his lungs at nothing. I understand he will smell things I can‚Äôt but this is 80% of the time outside. 

Neurological condition: I got him at 6 months old but was unaware he was suffering from a spinal subluxation - before the vets thought attacks were ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù - he was hospitalised, had spinal surgery, crate rested for three months. I‚Äôve taught him to walk and do all of his basic functions again. Last month he was discharged from the neurologist and physiotherapist. No brain damage has occurred, only neurological deficit is his mild ataxia. 50% of the time I‚Äôve had him he‚Äôs not been allowed outside. 

I‚Äôve worked with a trainer and two behaviourists and have seen zero improvement. In fact, due to spending most of his time inside as he will immediately freak out, he‚Äôs worse. Both say he can‚Äôt meet other dogs without using graded exposure, but have people had success muzzling their dog and letting them meet a calm dog? He used to live with dogs in Romania but now he can‚Äôt see/smell one without wanting to kill it. 

Medication: is on gabapentin and fluoxetine, no change from either. Vet wants to prescribe trazodone but has admitted they have no idea. Seems weird to me because he‚Äôs ataxic. I live in UK and have been told Zoloft is seldom used. We use diazepam occasionally but limited impact. Do people have positive experiences with Zoloft ? Considering a veterinary behaviourist but we‚Äôve spent over ¬£15,000 on vet bills. It‚Äôs absurd.

I‚Äôm attempting to contact other behaviourists but all say the same thing: do gradual graded exposure. Yes, in theory that‚Äôs great, but there‚Äôs no starting point. The others suggest using a muzzle to shut his mouth so he can‚Äôt bark and then click train (wtf is wrong with people) or using a collar for corrections. He can‚Äôt use a collar due to his surgical implant. 

If positive behaviourists don‚Äôt help, medication so far hasn‚Äôt helped and my vet/current behaviourist don‚Äôt know what to do, what is left? 

I live next to the beach so it‚Äôs a challenging area to control due to dog/foot traffic. I currently attempt training at stupid hours of the day in an attempt to avoid triggers, but he still barks at nothing. I love him so much but attempted to rehome him for his own good, I‚Äôve even contacted specialists who run facilities for dogs who can‚Äôt be homed, all have said no because he would be bullied due to his condition. I know this isn‚Äôt a good environment for him but for understandable reasons people and organisations won‚Äôt take him. I feel forgotten. 

I‚Äôm constantly heartbroken and the last 8 months have made me severely depressed. I‚Äôm considering euthanasia but don‚Äôt want to do it. I saved his life and am his rock. 

Any suggestions, medication, behavioural, specific behaviourists in the Uk, or anything else really, is hugely appreciated. If nothing else, thank you for reading - I suppose my boy and I are both in crisis.",No_Remote_3602,2022-11-20,16:33:12,2022,11,20,16,33,Sunday
0,DogAdvice,Dog bite,"I didn‚Äôt see any rules saying i cant post this, but I understand if it gets deleted.  TW- mention of dog fight, wounds, injuries. 

I live with family, and we have 6 dogs total, 2 are mine, two belong to sibling a (sibling a doesn‚Äôt live with us but dogs are here), one belongs to sibling b, and one is my moms. One of sibling a‚Äôs dogs (dog a1) resource guards everything, (but mom refuses to feed dogs separately) and has gone after 4/5 of the other dogs, who did nothing in response. 

A few months ago, dog a1 went after one of my dogs. She ended up going after him and we had to take dog a1 to the vet. 

This morning, dog a1 went after my dog again, and we had to separate. Everything had calmed down, so we didnt crate either of them. My mom and I were sitting on the couch, and dog a1 was between us. My dog came walking by us and he tried to to after her again. My mom moved her arm in front of dog a1 and my dog bit my mom. It was a severe bite, and my mom ended up needing surgery. 

Where i live, i am able to self quarantine my dog, so she‚Äôll be separated for ten days. Ive already arranged a foster for her after the quarantine is over (she was vaccinated in august so she is current), but what do i do from there? 

Sibling A hasnt lived in the house for almost a year but refuses to take her dogs. She lives in a pet friendly apartment and my mom paid her pet deposit. Dog a1 has had these issues for years, but no one has done anything to fix it or listens when i say his issues will only get worse as he gets older

Im not in a good place financially to move out, but i feel like that may be my only choice to keep my dog.

0,DogAdvice,My dogs won‚Äôt stop fighting.,"We have had my almost 2 yr old GSD (male, neutered) since he was 8 weeks. We just adopted a 9 month GSD pup (male, not neutered yet). We‚Äôve had the pup for a week and a half now. 

The first day I brought the puppy home they were fighting for 8 hours and I had to take work off the next day cause i literally got no sleep with them. Since then the fighting is slowly getting to be less, but it is still fairly constant. 

Most of the time the fighting is playful. But after hours it still gets annoying. My older dog has gotten mean a couple times but that gets shut down immediately. Even after wearing each other out completely one of them will walk by the other and they start fighting all over again. 

I try separating them sometimes so they can get ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù but this is not realistic to do constantly. I will give them distractions like toys or kongs but as soon as they don‚Äôt want those anymore it‚Äôs back to the same thing. They wear each other out until they are basically passing out from exhaustion and falling asleep very easily. I just don‚Äôt know how they sleep for 20 mins and are back at it again. 

I know my older dog is doing this more out of showing his dominance and establishing that. The pup is usually just doing puppy things like nipping or being curious of the older dog which sets him off again. Like I said they do get disciplined if either of their behavior goes too far and I feel it is mean.

Is fighting like this almost all day normal behavior? If it is when will it calm down to a reasonable amount? If not, what can I do to make this better?",goneboaling,2022-11-20,13:54:48,2022,11,20,13,54,Sunday

0,DogAdvice,At a fork in the road,My dog has been crated at night since she was a little puppy. She‚Äôs 2 now.  She has developed a habit of waking up extra early and banging on the crate to get out. Nothings wrong she just wants to lay in my bed with me. It‚Äôs disturbing my sleep. I never wanted her to sleep in my bed all night for a few reasons. For those whose dogs sleep with them how do you have ‚Äúprivate time‚Äù with your partner? Is your dog ok being boarded since they are used to sleeping with you?

0,DogAdvice,I am at the emergency vet rn - what could be the cause of the below symptoms?,"Brought my 9yr old blind &amp; diabetic pug/chihuahua mix to the vet due to:

-vomiting 4 times in the past 24 hours
-not eating
-had not gone to the bathroom
-very lethargic

They took him back and the vet tech said they noted:

-low temp (95 degrees)
-labored breathing
-also noted lethargy 
-other vitals are normal

She told me they have him under a heat lamp/blankets to bring his temp up. She didn‚Äôt offer any other explanations, but he is classified as ‚Äúurgent‚Äù (out of stable/urgent/critical). There are two other urgent cases ahead of him.

Any advice, speculation, etc. while I anxiously wait at the dog ER? Im hoping for some consoling information, but also want to be prepared for anything.",hollowag,2022-11-20,09:46:34,2022,11,20,9,46,Sunday

0,DogAdvice,New Behavior in Senior Dog- should I be concerned?,"I‚Äôve had my dog since he was 5, and he‚Äôs now 12. He‚Äôs a neutered Australian Shepherd (possibly mixed, but idk) and has always been very calm and not one to really play. He was a medical alert dog for his former elderly owner who passed away which is why I took him in. He was very under socialized and over weight, so it took a lot of training and attention to get him healthy and used to being around other dogs. He‚Äôs now very social, loves to walk and exercise, but again, doesn‚Äôt play with toys. I work from home, so every day we walk the beach and he gets a lot of mental and physical stimulation with me, my husband, and my kid. If I go anywhere, he usually comes with me, and only shows anxiety when I have to leave him. He loves everyone in the family, but he‚Äôs MY dog, and basically my shadow. I‚Äôd describe him as a Velcro dog.

Over the last few weeks, he has been getting really antsy in the evenings to the point where he will play with toys with me. It‚Äôs been really nice to see his playful side, since every time I think about him being 12 I get really sad, since I know Aussies usually live 13-15years. He has no current health issues and his vet says he‚Äôs in very good shape for his age.

Here‚Äôs the (possible) issue: when we get into playing, or when he sees me play with my daughter, he starts trying to hump me. He has never done this before to people or dogs. When we used to go to dog parks, he was always submissive. If I‚Äôm sitting on the floor he starts digging around my legs and eventually pulls my leg towards him and mounts up. Even when I move away he‚Äôll keep humping the air until I scratch his back and then he kinda snaps out of it. I try to keep the playing to fetch, since any tug of war or wrestling type play gets him humping.

I‚Äôm the only does it to me, nobody else. My concern is that this behavior could be a result of a health issue or could lead to a more concerning behavioral issue. I haven‚Äôt been able to find anything online as to why a 12 year old dog would suddenly start humping after never doing it before. Thanks!",moonlitemeadow,2022-11-20,08:02:02,2022,11,20,8,2,Sunday

0,DogAdvice,Just witnessed my neighbor's dogs getting into a fight and one of them seems pretty wounded. My neighbor isn't coming back until Monday.,"My neighbor has two  dogs -males, greek shepherds- who are always in the garden. He has a big garden and he has build a dog house for his dogs there.

So, the dogs seem to have a weird relationship with each other. One minute they're cuddling and the next they're fighting. It's very common for them to fight and it usually starts when something triggers them. They bark at a thing/animal/sound that triggered them and somehow they end up fighting pretty bad. I have talked to my neighbor about this and he seemed to consider it a normal thing like it's no big deal. 

Tonight I was walking my dog. Unfortunately, I can't avoid his house, so I have to pass by his dogs with my dog, who makes them bark, which sometimes leads them to fighting. Just like every time, when me and my dog passed by they both ran to the rails and started barking and then, they started fighting. One put the other down but I paid them no mind. I just moved on because I have seen them fighting before.

However, when my dog and I returned from our walk about 30 minutes later what I saw concerned me. One of the dogs, the one who was down, was still lying there and the other was standing on top of him doing nothing just standing there. When the one still standing saw us he ran to the rails to bark at us just as he usually does but the other did not move. The other dog kept laying there only moving his eyes to look around. When I walked closer, I saw blood on the side of his neck. I couldn't tell how bad the wound was because it was dark but the dog moving nothing but his eyes looking scared makes me believe it was quite bad. 

My neighbor is not home. He's usually away during the weekends and he returns on Monday or Tuesday. I have no way to contact him because I don't know his number and despite searching him on social media I couldn't find any profile matching his name and face (sounds creepy but I thought I could try reaching him on Facebook or something)

I went by his house 15 minutes ago. The wounded dog is still laying there and he now moves his head a little bit still looking very scared, while the other, the one that bit him, is lying next to him (it looks like he is protecting him/staying on his side but I am not expert). 

So, what do I do? Can I call anyone? The dogs are pretty aggressive to anyone trying to enter their territory, so I doubt anyone can approach them. I thought about calling the police but what if they put the dogs down? And if my neighbor finds out I called the police to his house while he was away, he is going to get angry and he is not a person one can reason with. 

I have contacted a group of volunteers who help dogs in my town but they haven't answered my messages yet. 

Is it possible the dog could die from the bite during the night? Should the dogs be separated? What am I supposed to do in cases like this? I feel helpless. Should I just contact the police and hope for the best? (according to the law here, the police can intervene in cases of animal abuse and they can take the animal away).",honeyapple0,2022-11-20,06:24:28,2022,11,20,6,24,Sunday

I was scrolling on Facebook and saw a post of someone that was needing to rehome a chaweenie and without any questions asked (stupidly) i volunteered to take the male dog in.(huge mistake) The past 8 years I‚Äôve been having to multiple times a day clean up after he uses the bathroom EVERYWHERE!! I‚Äôve legitimately tried everything I‚Äôve taken him to behavior classes, I‚Äôve done positive reinforcement, I‚Äôve done scheduling his bathrooms and eating times, I‚Äôve tried potty pads( he refuses to use it), I take him outside constantly (he refuses), I have gone as far as making him diapers (his body shape requires suspenders) and the dog doesn‚Äôt care he will pee and poop in them constantly!

0,DogAdvice,Hearing loss,"Hello! I have and 11 1/2 year old great dane. Recently, he has been exhibiting a signs of deafness (not listening, excessively vocal). I originally thought he was just getting stubborn in his old age. However, over the past few weeks I started thinking he might be deaf because he wouldn't even notice when visitors were at the house. It seemed happen almost overnight. He went to the vet and she said there was some fluid in his ear and performed a hearing test (making a sound behind him with a chime?) which she said he didn't respond to. She said it was likely due to age. I wasn't the one who actually took him to the appointment so I'm not sure why nothing could be done regarding getting rid of the fluid or what it was from.

I feel like he can still hear to some degree though. If I say ""do you want to go for a walk?"" Or ""do you want to go for a ride?"" He gets attentive and turns his head to the side like he always has. This works even if he isn't looking at me. 

So does this mean he can still hear to some degree or is he detecting familiar vibrations? Like right now he is napping next to me and I said his name.. He seemed to twitch a little but didn't wake up.

Also, any advice on whistles or perhaps vibrating collars to help get his attention if needed would be greatly appreciated.",Aggressive_Peach8138,2022-11-20,03:07:43,2022,11,20,3,7,Sunday

0,DogAdvice,To rehome or not to rehome,"Hello. I have a major dilemma here and maybe someone could give me insight on my thoughts to solve it. I would like to not have to rehome my dog by any means.  But. 

I am looking at starting a career change.  I‚Äôve hit a sudden and unexpected brick wall in my life and things are about to change dramatically.  Where I currently work I take the dog to work with me.  She is almost never ever alone as she goes everywhere with me work or not.  This job is unexpectedly ending.  As a result I am looking at relocating to a new city, and starting a career as a plumber which is something I‚Äôve wanted to get into.  Apprentices do not make much for the first or second year.  I‚Äôd be selling my home and besides apprentice salary, be living from the house sale until my monthly income gets higher and I‚Äôm once again in the green.  At which point I‚Äôd probably down payment a house with what I have left.  

The dilemma is that to keep the dog I am going to have to leave her home during the day.  I can probably spend the 200-300 a week hiring someone to come in halfway through the day and give her a walk.  I‚Äôd also walk or run her before and after work.  This would get expensive, but I could do it assuming by year two or 3 of apprenticeship my salary would increase and I‚Äôm not at a deficit each month.  Without the dog, I wouldn‚Äôt be in a deficit at all.  

But the money is only one thing I worry about.  The main thing is leaving her alone so much.   I hate the idea as she‚Äôs never spent much time alone.  There is a co worker currently who has a family with kids and a dog who might be open to taking her.   The dog absolutely loves this guy and she also loves kids and other dogs.  His wife is stay at home.   Kids are homeschooled.  She would have a good life.  

I‚Äôm seriously torn what to do here. It isn‚Äôt an easy decision by any means.",Eyeofhorus34,2022-11-20,00:17:21,2022,11,20,0,17,Sunday

0,DogAdvice,My dog just bit her groomer :(,"She's a year and a half old and is normally very friendly with everyone, people and dogs alike. She loves children when we see them out walking

We have noticed for the past month or so when we tell her to go outside for a pee before bed she has turned around and snapped if we attempted to touch her, so we don't touch her we just raise our voice and she relents and goes outside to pee. I felt awful when this happened as I never want to put her in a situation where she feels like she needs to bite, so I don't.

She's been going to the same groomer every month since we got her and they always say she has been difficult to groom and hates all of it, but never any aggression. I tried to help her by bathing her at home sometimes, using the hairdryer etc and she's great with me. I bring her with me into a small room in the house where she can't escape my hairdryer and I don't need to hold her or force anything. We play with toys while I dry her and she doesn't care.

Today they were trying to dry her, one person had the dryer and the other was holding her still and attempted to put a towel over her (apparently they do this to calm them but I've never heard of it). She 'freaked out', turned around and bit the groomer. She didn't break the skin but bit her quite hard.

I guess my question is - what should I do now to be responsible to her and to others? Can she be around my niece supervised? Should I avoid that groomers? Is it better to just groom her myself from now on?

We are keeping an eye on her in case there's a health reason, but I honestly think she's fine and I understand why she reacts how she does. She's such a great dog in every other way, and I'm just really sad this happened",trufflekitten7,2022-11-19,19:08:22,2022,11,19,19,8,Saturday

For the last week she's been losing a lot of hair and the last 2 days at 19pm aprox she suddenly starts shivering and exhibits very low energy throughout a 20-30 minutes period during which I feed her 5ml of honey water with a syringe because she seems to get better after that, then she goes to sleep and the next morning she's full of energy again. 

If there's anyone reading this who has a diabetic dog, I'd appreciate if you shared your experience with me and gave me some advice, I don't sleep at all because I'm scared and constantly checking on her.

Should I wait until Monday test results or bring her to the ER? What worries me the most is that after the episodes, she will act as normal as If nothing had happened.",JudyCherry,2022-11-19,17:42:43,2022,11,19,17,42,Saturday

0,DogAdvice,How to clean teeth of 3 yr old GSD we winded up with?,"Long story short: 
I winded up with her as a foster fail and I believe her teeth needs cleaning but she won‚Äôt let anyone come near her mouth.
How do I introduce brushing teeth to her?

Details:

I‚Äôve been a cat person all my life.
Both my cats passed after 16 &amp; 18 years of wonderful company.
A year after, I volunteered to temporarily host now-our dog, because she was abandoned by her owner and his parents were going to put her in pound.  The dog pound employees guaranteed that she‚Äôs be put down b/c they had no room.
We tried to re-home.. no one would take her.
So she‚Äôs ours now, vets, trainer ‚Ä¶ etc.

0,DogAdvice,Dog acting weird after leaving him with neighbour,"Just to be clear, I dont think there was any abuse involved. Ive known my neighbour for a few years now and I've seen him and obviously heard him in the back yard with his own dog before she passed away, he's got a very kind heart towards animals but I am also confused at why my dog is acting strange.

We have a Deerhound x Staghound and my partner and I have started working similar hours so hes pretty much left at home for 8 hours alone instead of the original 2.5 hours and it has been stressing me out a bit. My neighbour offered to look after him during the day when we're not home which seems like the ideal scenario. His wife is sick so he doesnt get to leave the house a lot so the company is probably good for both of them.

I left him today for a couple of hours whilst i worked a half day for a bit of a trial period, gave my neighbour the run down and the do's/dont's and was on my way. Thanks for reading the rambling just wanted to clarify the situation and scenario. 

Home now and he seems to be acting a bit aloof and depressed. Is this normal? Have I just upset his routine? I think this will be a better routine in the long run. Is it fear of abandonment or something? I'm very lost and would love some answers on whether or not im doing the right or wrong thing. Thanks",AuntyBill,2022-11-19,10:39:22,2022,11,19,10,39,Saturday

0,DogAdvice,Dog won't play with her toys anymore,"Hi, I'm not totally sure if this is the appropriate place to ask this, but I'm wondering if anyone has any advice. I have a 5 year old female husky that I've had since she was 7 weeks old. Of course like most huskies she's pretty high energy, and has always chewed on and destroyed toys since I got her. Her favorites tend to be string toys (that I monitor bc she's bad about trying to eat the string), stuffed animals (that I get very rarely bc she destroys them so fast and makes a huge mess), and cardboard, which she mostly just likes tearing up.

Back at the end of July I made a big move. This was clearly pretty hard on my dog. I lived with someone else before and there was another dog in the house that we got when she was about 3 months old, a female border collie. This border collie lived with us and my husky for 3 years (we got her when my husky was 2). 

When I moved the border collie went with the other person. I moved into a much smaller place and simply could not handle two dogs right now, especially two high energy dogs. 

Not only has my husky become a lot more anxious and needy (she clings to me and follows me room to room, which she never did before. She's affectionate but never like this) but she basically won't touch her toys anymore. I even got her a stuffed animal when we got here and even now months later it's intact. She licks it sometimes but that's about it. 

She eats and drinks normally, was in total health last time i took her to the vet, she still loves to go on walks and play with other dogs when I can manage to get her to a dog park, but she will not touch her toys. 

The combination of the anxiety and lack of interest in toys has me a little worried since she hasn't gotten better in all this time. It also makes caring for her pretty difficult as she seems to struggle to entertain herself at all and wants attention from me, and especially exercise, 24/7. I do what I can but I have my own stuff to do, and quite frankly some days after having already walked her a few miles and trying to play with her (which she's not really up for at my apartment either) I don't have the energy or interest in more play time. 

I'm going to be in this apartment for a while longer. I was wondering if anyone had any advice as to what I could do to get her to actually play with her toys again. I've tried rotating her toys, tried getting her new things(new rope toy, stuffed animals, rubber ones) but the only ones she has any interest in are new bones, and even those she gets bored of pretty quickly. I can't exactly afford to just constantly buy her new bones she barely even makes a dent on anymore every week. 

I thought at first she just needed more time but we're coming up on 5 months now of this. I'm not sure what to do to help her.",spinningmous,2022-11-19,09:17:42,2022,11,19,9,17,Saturday

0,DogAdvice,My Dog Keeps Regurgitating His Food,"Hi r/DogAdvice. My dog is a 2 year old neutered male corgi. He is a pretty vomit-y dog in general, so at first this didn't raise too many alarm bells (he has been to the vet for vomiting three times and they never could find a reason for it). For the past three days, he's been regurgitating some or all of his food a few minutes after eating. Not every time, but at least once per day. It's not always all of his food (sometimes it is) but 50-75%. He is pooping like normal, has plenty of energy, drinking normally, and doesn't seem lethargic at all. He is acting completely normal, other than the regurgitating. He also has a slow feeder, but I'm not sure if it's actually effective at slowing him down since it's the same bowl he's had since he was a puppy. We haven't changed anything in his diet or anything like that. He does have allergies and we give him Benedryl on days it's really bad, but he hasn't taken any for a week or so. We are going to try and find a vet that can take him before the holidays, but our normal vet is completely booked. My only thought now is that either a) the slow feeder is not slowing him down enough or b) he's anxious.

0,DogAdvice,5 y/o Dog has randomly started peeing in the house - advice,"So we adopted a shelter dog in 2019, she was fully potty trained, never made any accidents, knew tricks, etc. the only issue we faced was she had separation anxiety and she couldn‚Äôt be left home alone in a cage .

0,DogAdvice,Help with getting dog to go to the bathroom post surgery.,"Afternoon, our 3.5 year old lab/hound mix had TPLO surgery 10 days ago. Since home she has been going to the bathroom about every 10 to 14 hours. These last two days she is now only going every 22ish hours. Her not peeing is more of a concern than pooping in that time frame and i dont want her to get a bladder infection.

She has actually been drinking more water than when she came home over a week ago and I take her out multiple times throughout the day ranging from 15 mins to an hour. She is also eating her normal amount of food pre-surgery.

These last two days she just wanders around the yard and seems to just straight up refuse to go to the bathroom. I'm not sure how to get her to go. I have taking the cone off, gave her a bit of space with the leash and also giving her access to previous no entry sections for her in our backyard. We also keep it clean as usual and don't leave her droppings behind.

0,DogAdvice,Am I wrong to convince my bf to make his dogs live indoors?,"This is going to be long, bear with me.
My bf has three dogs, two of which are large 9 month old picardy spaniels (littermates) who live in a 10x20 dog run (the other dog spends the day in his parents backyard). All of his dogs are outside dogs, but he allows one of his favorites to sleep inside every night. He has never had an indoor dog before. He got the two large Picardy‚Äôs as 8 week old puppies and pretty much put them immediately in the dog run. They haven‚Äôt been trained at all and they get minimal attention. They don‚Äôt even have a dog house big enough for one of them, let alone both. They bark constantly and they jump like crazy, especially if anyone is near the fence. (They get so wild to the point that I‚Äôm nervous they will hurt themselves.) He says they have plenty of toys but I‚Äôve never seen them. He also tells me that he lets them out of the run and gives them lots of space to roam around a few times a week. I told him they should sleep inside, especially since his other dog gets to and he says ‚Äúthey‚Äôre fine‚Äù because all of his life he has had outside dogs and they were ‚Äúfine‚Äù. We live in the south, so I get it, it‚Äôs not *that* cold, but it‚Äôs just not right, and surely cant be comfortable. I just think he has a totally different view on dogs. To me, he treats them like an accessory. Meanwhile, I have four dogs who are a little spoiled. Mine are all well trained and allowed on the couch with me and sleep in bed next to me. 
His excuse for not letting them inside is that they are dirty, smelly and very loud and unruly. I have told him several times that they‚Äôre just untrained so they don‚Äôt know any better and the solution to the problem is to train them. I was under the impression that as soon as they get trained, he will allow them to sleep inside, but it‚Äôs not looking that way. I asked him if he has looked into training them and he says he just wants to find a specific trainer who will prepare them for hunting. 
I told him they will get nowhere hunting without first learning basic obedience so it doesn‚Äôt matter. 
I just want these beautiful dogs to have a fulfilling, comfortable, and happy life. And I don‚Äôt think he realizes that the dogs being with him more (even just laying at his feet while watching TV in the evening) will build a bond and end up making him happier too. I just think that he has never had the opportunity to bond with a dog closely so he will never understand my point of view until he does. 
It‚Äôs just so sad to see them yelp and jump and whine for attention all the time. I hate that they are stuck in a tiny space and don‚Äôt even have a dog house. And it makes me so upset that he says ‚Äúthey‚Äôre fine‚Äù because they deserve so much better than ‚Äúfine‚Äù. Seeing them bark and jump in their tiny space makes me cry every time.

And this is not even mentioning the ignorance of him putting these two siblings (M+F) together in the same enclosure for 9 straight months. I‚Äôm worried about littermate syndrome and possible inbreeding occurring. 

Is it wrong of me to try to convince him to make them indoor dogs? If not, how do I do it? I don‚Äôt want to guilt trip him all the time but I don‚Äôt know how to emphasize how important it is to me, especially as the temperature starts dropping. It‚Äôs so unfair to those wonderful dogs and it‚Äôs upsetting that he is unfazed by it. 

Advice?

TLDR: my bf has outside dogs that, from my perspective, would be a hell of a lot happier living inside but he says they‚Äôre too disobedient to live inside because they‚Äôre totally untrained. I want them to live inside but he and i have totally different views on dogs.",shutchi,2022-11-19,01:01:03,2022,11,19,1,1,Saturday

0,DogAdvice,Looking for dog incontinence help,"Essentially what the title says. I have a small 5lb senior chihuahua. She has congestive heart failure and her medication makes her have a lot of accidents. I‚Äôm tired of having to constantly wash rugs, blankets, sheets, beds, etc. I tried pee pads but she doesn‚Äôt understand them. I have bought disposable diapers but she easily takes them off. So, I bought cloth diapers with suspenders that require diaper inserts. She still somehow finds a way to take them off. However, when she does keep them on it seems like they leak anyway. The cloth diaper is always soaked and often I still find places where she completely peed on the carpet through her diaper. I‚Äôve even bought two separate ‚Äúwaterproof‚Äù dog blankets to cover my bed and some of the floor. I‚Äôm seriously losing my mind from living in pee smell but it‚Äôs impossible for me to find all the places where the diaper fails or when she gets out of the diaper when I‚Äôm not home. 

Every diaper that I have found online has some review talking about how it isn‚Äôt actually leak proof because either it isn‚Äôt absorbent enough, or it spills over the leg holes. Blankets also have these types of reviews.

Side note: I have even considered if I could scent train my younger dog to tell me where she peed so I could make sure to clean it up asap and really good but idk if that is confusing for a dog ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

0,DogAdvice,About to Fly across continents and then drive cross country with 2 dogs....any advice on how to get ready?,"So, the USA + any USA Airlines rules have made it practically impossible to fly home from Brazil to the USA that doesn't cost 6k to bring them home with me. SO I have found 1 airline that will still fly a dog under the plane with you that is a latin america airlines BUT They only fly into 2 cities, Miami or NY. My destination....New Mexico. SO, I need to rent a car to drive from Rio to Sao Paulo (8 hours). Then Fly the dogs from Sao Paulo to Miami strait flight, 8 hours, then rent a car from miami and drive to New Mexico....(30ish hours) This isn't a spur of the moment vacation or anything this is a change of countries for safety and my family. So there is just no...not leaving or not going. And this is my only way to bring my fur family with me and I am willing to do it....Any advice on how to acclimate and get the dogs ready for this trip in 2 months to make this as smooth as possible I'd really appreciate.

Mini Schnauzer has flown cross continental before from mexico to brazil. He's crate trained but deaf now...maybe a bonus because he won't hear all the plane noises? Also great in cars and long road trips. But I've never done....Cross country road trip with him.

Newer Member is 1 years old and very clingy and I've been working on his crate training, what I worry about is his separation anxiety that I've mostly worked on so I can leave the house anytime, But I don't know how he will take me leaving him at the airport. He's also good in cars but the only long trip he's been on is when we rescued him in the mountains and brought him home. He's also 2xs bigger then the mini schnauzer.

I'm a bit overwhelmed but I want them to be safe and comfortable and I want to buy things for the car, A) to protect it from dogs to hopefully not have to pay for detailing, and to keep them safe out of the crates (because both won't fit in a car without disassembly) And how to make this as easy of a transition for them because this is about to be a crap ton of change all at once.

For context we've got a labrador puppy who is 5 and a half months and two 4 year old cats.

Puppy is always on a house line and is never allowed to chase the cats. Ever.

We got home yesterday evening and one of my cats (the more confident one!) now bolts out of the room whenever puppy comes in. I'm not sure what has happened but he's become petrified of him and it's making me so so sad.

Any ideas/tips what I can do to repair the relationship??? It was going so well and I'm heartbroken that our cat has had something happen that has scared him this much of our puppy.

I usually pick him up by the armpit regon and from time to time he yelps. I try to be as gentle as I can but idk üò∂. I picked up other pets like this and they never had a problem with it so it confuses me on what I'm doing wrong. 

I originally thought it was his harness rubbing against his armpits making them hurt but that doesn't seem to be the case since he hasn't worn it in months. It's not ever single time I pick him up but it is enough to notice. I even examined the area there doesn't seem to be anything that could cause him pain. I must be holding him wrong or still some how being rough. I don't think I am or at least trying not to be. I feel so bad. I don't pick him up often, only when I need him to move or go outside.

0,DogAdvice,2 y/o Cav King Charles still potties inside..,"Mochi, my 2-year-old Cavalier, sweet as the dickens and mostly smart to boot, can't seem to understand that outside is the only place he should go to the bathroom. We take him out regularly, almost too often by comparison to the tens of dogs I've had prior (and I know they are all different). We even got him mostly button trained so that he'll press a button (one in our living space, another in our bedroom) when he wants to go outside. But, at least once a day now, he'll just decide to go inside instead. The time is random, as is the accident and place he goes.  


He's fixed. And even when he does go inside, it's not in the same spot, and (if it's pee) it's never with a raised leg as if to mark. We always clean it with an enzyme cleaner, and a fancy carpet-washing vacuum to be sure that it's thorough. As I said, it's at least once a day, but never at the same time. I get up at 5 AM Monday thru Friday to walk him, and most mornings it's dragging him out of bed just to get up (it's cold and he's a snuggly lazy boy who likes to stay next to us under the weighted blanket, lol). He goes and does his business and then back to bed while I get ready for work. My partner gets up around 8 AM, and sometimes finds that Mochi has gone again, not even a full 3 hours later! If it's a good morning though, we can almost be assured there's going to be a different time that day he decides to have his accident. My partner stays up nightly, between 1 to 2 AM almost every weekday, just to make sure he goes outside before bed!  


During the day, if Mochi has to go, he'll press the button. My partner works from home, so Mochi gets to go out regularly on a short schedule just to try and keep ahead of the accidents as best we can. This basically has lined up to be 5 AM, 8 AM, 1 PM, 5 PM, 10 PM, and 1 AM. We had discovered back when things were really bad with his accidents, Mochi wasn't getting put in his kennel (we call it his home when speaking to him) enough for nap times. When we started that, it helped immensely, but not completely. We feed him regularly, twice a day, with the same amount of recommended food in the morning between 8 and 10 AM (depending on if we slept in on the weekend), and then again around 6 PM (depending on when we've had dinner, as he knows to go into his home while we eat, and his dinner is right after). He has constant access to clean, running water from a tip-proof cat water fountain. He likes it because his ""sister"" (our black cat) likes it, and they're the best of friends.  


And honestly, the craziest thing is, he'll have a day of the week (sometimes a weekday, sometimes a weekend, but not typically more than 2 times a week) where he not only doesn't have an accident, but he won't even ask to go outside for what most deem a normal amount of time between his restroom breaks, 8 hours! And he'll have those days without anything else being different - his meals, his naps, play times with either us or his sister, etc. But no matter what we do, we literally cannot come up with what we can do to replicate those days.  


We've taken him to our vet, who has done x-rays and scans to see if his bladder is ""small"" or if there's any infection(s), but he's in perfect health, and even more so considering his breed! We've been told over and over since he was a puppy (idc what people say, he still is, okay!!) ""Don't worry, it'll pass, and he'll be trained before you know it,"" or ""Just keep at it, and he'll get it,"" or ""have you tried to reward him with treats while outside and after he goes potty,"" or ""make sure you take him out consistently/at the same time,"" and more. We've tried them all. He's not the first dog I've had, not the first dog that I got while on my own, and certainly not the first dog I've potty trained, whether in my family or on my own. But we're out of ideas, and we've gone through all the typical advice. This can't be his normal. He's such a good boy, and the biggest love bug you'd ever seen, and the greatest snuggler in the world. There's gotta be something we can do to help him be the bestest boy we know he is.

0,DogAdvice,Puppy Help,"I recently adopted a puppy and although I have had dogs my entire life I have never rescued one younger than 1.

0,DogAdvice,Need help with my multi-dog household,"I have a 5 year old Australian Cattle Dog mix boy and a 9 month old Poodle mix girl.

When my girl was younger and not potty trained, she was exclusively in a playpen in the kitchen. Gave her alone time everyday and it went okay. She wasn‚Äôt totally comfortable, but didn‚Äôt bark, cry, act upset etc. She basically just stared at the door.

After she got spayed around 6 months, and is now potty trained, I fully puppy proofed my bedroom and moved her in there. Not in the playpen, just stuck a baby gate at the door and let her free roam. Here‚Äôs the kicker, she has barrier frustration and is destroying the gate at the door. I try to give her alone time, but the barking and chewing commences as soon as I walk away. I leave her with toys and chews, but it‚Äôs not enough to engage her. 

I have a CTC, CPDT-KA, SAPro trainer, but it‚Äôs been little help. She says the two dogs play well together, but will never be able to be alone together because of their size differences (he‚Äôs about 70 pounds, she‚Äôs about 12 pounds). She recommends giving them 10-15 minutes a day supervised together without toys and then increasing the time. Which, cool but if she has barrier frustration and needs to be separated when I‚Äôm away, how do I do that? Now that she‚Äôs had freedom, she doesn‚Äôt care for her pen or crate anymore. Do I re-train her to go in her crate or playpen? Would half a day doggy daycare once a week help her be separated from me? Am I just a moron?! She can‚Äôt just free roam around my place because she steals his toys, steals whatever she can find, and just has no chill still. 

Sorry for my rambling, I‚Äôm just so frustrated and with US holidays coming up, and her not being able to be alone at all anymore I don‚Äôt know what to do.

TL;DR: have two dogs of very different size. One is a puppy who has barrier frustration. Trainer says dogs can‚Äôt be alone unsupervised. How do I get around all this and get her more comfy in her surroundings?",angryears923,2022-11-18,05:57:45,2022,11,18,5,57,Friday
0,DogAdvice,How much would you pay for a pet sitter?,"Hi all! So, we have 3 dogs and a cat, and they really haven't had to be alone for much time at all, aside from a couple hours to go to the movies or something. I work from home, and on weekends we take them \*everywhere\* we can (except for Kitty, because he hates traveling, so we try to limit needing to take him places).

So anyway, we have a Friendsgiving an hour away, and we haven't seen any of these friends since we moved this January, so I'm not sure how long we will be there, and it was really starting to stress me out thinking about leaving them for 4-5+ hours (especially our littlest, who is 12 lbs who has a tiny bladder and is super super attached to me), so I asked my younger sister (she's 21 and a senior at the university in town here - SUCH a good kid) if she'd be able to hang out at our house and hang out with them, let them out to potty, etc. I told her she could do whatever she wanted, sleep, study, netflix, etc, essentially just make herself at home. She agreed and said she's really excited to see them and spend time with them and I'm SO grateful for it. 

My big question is, how much would you pay for a pet/house sitter for 5-7 hours? Money is really tight for me right now, but I want to be sure to pay her fairly. Not only because I truly appreciate her help (especially on a Saturday when she probably definitely has offers to get turnt with her college friends), but also because I feel like as her older sister I feel like it's important to set a precedent in place to where she's expected to be paid fairly for her work. She and I have a lot of similarities and she's SUCH a sweetheart, but I spent a good amount of my 20s being essentially a doormat/happiness pump/people pleaser, and if I can help to set a different precedent for her, I'd really like to.

0,DogAdvice,Winter doggy care questions-,"So I'm a first time dog owner and I have some questions about winter care. Firstly I'll explain the weather in my area so it's easier to understand my concerns, here in Silesia we usually have no snow up until like mid December or even January, but it is very rainy and windy, and when the snow does appear it's VERY common to put salt/sand on the roads and sidewalks (it's also said that it's gonna be snowing a lot this year but they usually straight up lie so idk yet we'll see). 

Now as for my dog- she's 4 yo, weights 10.6 kg and is double coated.

Now as for the questions, first being- Do I buy her doggy shoes??? She already has some depigmentations going on on her paw pads because it's very cold (during the night it's below 0¬∞C) and I don't know if it hurts her or is annoying? I've read the paw pads will get very dry during winter but nothing some beanie moisturizer can't fix but I'm not sure, there's also the topic of salt on ice which I know is painful for dogs to walk on.

Now the second question HOW DO I KNOW IF SHES COLD- I know! I know she's double coated and she's most likely NOT cold, but now that she's shedding, her coat is very thin and she's always very cold to touch after our walks so I thought maybe she's cold because of all that balding situation? Do you think I need to gear her up for winter or just leave her be with her beanie moisturizer???",krzeslodobiurka,2022-11-17,23:57:37,2022,11,17,23,57,Thursday
0,DogAdvice,Please help! Possible allergic reaction to food?,"Last night I noticed a small bump on my 1 yr old chihuahua‚Äôs nose. 30 mins later I look over and her whole snout is swollen. I called the emergency vet and she said not to panic, give her a half a Benadryl and it should go down. It finally did this morning but the poor baby was itching her whole body all night and still is. Also, I think she threw up this morning. Do you think this can be caused by a food allergy? Or does that not make sense with the sudden snout swelling? I also don‚Äôt know whether to make a vet appt. The vet didn‚Äôt seem concerned last night and I‚Äôm worried they‚Äôd charge me so much money to just be like ya give her more Benadryl and stop feeding her whatever food you gave her.

0,DogAdvice,Matting advise,"Hey, so i‚Äôve never posted on reddit before, but i‚Äôm in need of some help 

I wasn‚Äôt sure whether to post this on here or somewhere else, but i figured this place was as good as any.

Onto the main reason for my post, i‚Äôm a minor (not going to say exact age) and i have three dogs. I‚Äôve owned all of them since i was in elementary school, and i‚Äôve been expected to care for them all on my own. This includes feeding, walking, cleaning, grooming, etc. And while my parents did help me sometimes, i‚Äôve mostly been on my own. Due to this, my dogs have become very matted over the years. I‚Äôve always managed to just shave off the mats myself, luckily without hurting them, but it takes a very long time, multiple days on some occasions. Recently one of my dogs has developed some really thick matts on all four of her legs, they‚Äôre so close to her skin that i‚Äôm too scared to try to cut them off. I tried asking my mom if i could take then to get shaved at a groomers, but she said that they‚Äôll take my dog away if they find out she‚Äôs matted, and i really don‚Äôt want that. 

Will the groomers actually take her away? She‚Äôs not badly neglected, she‚Äôs clean and flea free, she just has some really bad matts on her legs. I have a job, so i can pay for a sedated groom if needed, i just don‚Äôt want my dog to be in pain anymore. 

I know that this is my fault, i haven‚Äôt been brushing her like i should have, there‚Äôs just so much going on in my life atm, so i keep putting off brushing her, but now it‚Äôs too late

what should i do? i really don‚Äôt want my dog taken away from me, i‚Äôve had her for so many years, but i don‚Äôt want her to be in pain",Substantial-Skin-810,2022-11-17,13:07:06,2022,11,17,13,7,Thursday
0,DogAdvice,Dog is healthy but isn‚Äôt doing much or eating enough,"So my dog is an older male, but he‚Äôs still in good health aside from pancreatitis. When we found out he had it, we switched him to a low fat diet, but he‚Äôs gradually gotten more skinny until he ended up losing a quarter of his weight. We took him to the vet and they said everything seems healthy and he just needs more calories without fat, so we‚Äôve been trying to feed him that stuff, but he still doesn‚Äôt appear to be eating much. He‚Äôll eat, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like it is as much or even an improvement on how much he ate before. He also lays down a lot more than usually and walks slower when going on walks, but I‚Äôd assume that is due to lack of energy from losing so much weight, since he can still be active when he wants.

The animals came into the cities and towns and chose to hang out. 

I always wondered if they actually missed us humans.  I doubt it , we have always been a pain in the ass to other beings and vegetation. 

They probably just wanted to come in and sniff around, to make sure we were actually gone. And then they all probably did a jig together celebrating!!

Anyway that was my sad take on it cause I, for one, loved all those animal friends. But they were probably needing a break!

0,DogAdvice,Question about Stray Dog I Fed,"I‚Äôm really sad today because there was this stray dog I was feeding where I lived , I usually stay away from strays because I have really bad anxiety and depression, I don‚Äôt like seeing things I care for suffer! This stray was different he was very calm ,relaxed would just sit under my trailer and I began feeding him every morning . He slowly started getting energy because when he arrived he would lay under my moms car and not move no matter what . I had splash water on him for him to move so we could use the car. He was the nicest dog I‚Äôve met even more so than my own dog and seemed to not need much except food . Well a couple came to pick him up cause they liked how calm he was and he is a beautiful dog  a German Shepherd. I have anxiety so I don‚Äôt work regular 5 day work week . I do odd jobs every now and then , I had 300 dollars I was saving up because I need a tooth pulled cause I have a cavity . Anyways I ended up wasting all my money on flea treatments for him and my yard because me and my neighbors got infested with fleas because he would lay under my house , it was really bad but o didn‚Äôt mind because I just wanted him to be healthy and clean so the couple would have no reason to not want him or put him out on the streets again. It was a huge weight lifted from my shoulders cause I really can‚Äôt handle responsibility or worries . The dog I own I love now but initially I took her in against my will because my brother was going to the army and I wanted her to be with ppl she knew rather than strangers. Im going off topic . 3 weeks ago my mom said the couple loved him and he was free in their fenced In yard. Being well taken care off I was so happy . Now unfortunately I found out today that he began to get aggressive. He ripped the neighbors cat to shreds apparently and they tried tying him up after that because when they would leave he would escape and try going with them , follow the woman everywhere. He didn‚Äôt want to be tied up though , would apparently pull very hard on his leash and trash around which I think is kind of normal if he hasn‚Äôt ever been tied up . But when they took him I put him on a leash and he was calm with them just stood or sat next to us. Apparently he ended up biting one of their children ! They told my mom that he escaped or was taken but I found out that they actually took him somewhere  else and abandoned him. They didn‚Äôt tell me cause they didn‚Äôt want me getting mad. Now I‚Äôm so confuse as to al that effort I put in and how calm and nice he was . To how everything turned out. I feel like things always turn out bad and that‚Äôs why I stay away from strays . I‚Äôm so confused and I hope someone can give me some clarity! I‚Äôm sorry for this long post , I just needed to vent and also needed someone to understand!

0,DogAdvice,"Pair of dogs bark at every dog they see on the street, how to make them chill?","Hi everybody, so recently we adopted 2 dogs, a mom and son, they're pretty friendly towards people and relaxed overall. We are still adapting to the change since we only had a dog previously which was smaller although more aggressive.

The thing is these 2 are on the bigger side, the mom is like a mix of golden/lab and the son it's a husky mix. It's already quite the exercise going on a walk since they go crazy, they do relax and walk slowly after a bit but whenever a dog shows up, no matter what dog, the mom starts barking and does sound more aggressive, the son seems more playful because he even cries like if he wants to play. We don't let them of the leash since we don't know them yet and don't know if they could run away or cross the street, etc.

The problem is that sometimes I have to take them for a walk by myself and when they pull barking at another dog, between the 2 of them they do give me trouble holding them, once I already slipped and lost the leash of the son while in the middle of the street. Luckily there weren't any cars but I figured this could be an issue.

Also since we live in an apartment they sometimes make quite a bit of noise barking at the other dogs, so I want to see how to make them chill a little, any training tips are appreciated",Disastrous-Lemon7456,2022-11-17,08:11:28,2022,11,17,8,11,Thursday

0,DogAdvice,Advice for keeping a dog permanently off the bed?,"Hello there!

I have a senior dog who went completely blind very abruptly a few days ago. The vet diagnosed her with glaucoma and she is receiving treatment, but it seems as though the blindness is going to be permanent. 

Which brings me to the question: how can I safely prevent my dog from jumping onto my bed?

My bed is very high - I am an average height woman and the top of it is at hip-level for me. She has never had trouble jumping up, even after going blind - but getting down has been trickier. She is afraid to jump because she can't see the floor (and it's a long way down to be jumping blind) but she also panics if I try to pick her up to put her on the floor. While this is what I've been doing, it is stressful for her and she has snapped at me more than once - so I think it is in both of our best interest to not continue doing that. 

While she has also made the jump down a few times, I'm worried about the possibility that she'll hurt herself - either from the actual jump, or from hitting any of the nearby furniture. 

I've tried giving her a step - a solid piece of furniture to hop onto between the bed and floor - but even if I picked her up and put her on it, she wouldn't go from there to the bed and I also couldn't coax her from the bed onto the step. 

My bedroom unfortunately doesn't have a surplus of free space, so I don't have any room for a ramp that would be large enough for her - and I don't believe that she'd be inclined to use one.

I feel like the safest solution long-term would be to prevent her from getting onto the bed at all - she'll be sad, I'll be sad, but I won't have to worry about her breaking her neck jumping down into a bookshelf. She does have a pet bed right next to mine that she uses sometimes already, and I'm hoping to make that her permanent sleep spot. 

I've mostly been looking at things like toddler rails, but as this is my first experience with a blind dog and I've never actually used these sorts of rails before, I don't know if they'd be sufficient to stop a 40 pound dog from just barreling through or around them. Has anyone here tried this approach before, or are there better solutions?

She's a very stubborn dog, so unfortunately I don't think I could trust training alone for her (Chow mix) - and while she has a crate, it is in a different room and I don't think she'd like being confined to it at night. It is unfortunately too large to have in my bedroom with the space I have available, and she likes to be where I am.",ScoopOfOof,2022-11-17,06:49:05,2022,11,17,6,49,Thursday
0,DogAdvice,"Crazy itchy but not food, allergies or fleas?","My cockapoo is struggling so so bad with itching. It's awful just before bed its like he's going nuts and as he sleeps with us it keeps us awake. The vet has ruled out that it's not food, he was prescribed flea treatment so it's not that and he is on apoquel allergy tablets and they don't work for shit.
Nothing in his environment has changed but we just don't know where to start eliminating to see what triggers it.
The emergency vet gave him an injection and steroids and they worked instantly just with bad side effects and he can't be on them long term. Our regular vets are quick to prescribe multiple tablets at a high cost. (my cats on 3! and none work)
He goes back tomorrow but the next step is a more expensive allergy medication and then allergy tests. They think it's seasonal but it's been bad since June. 

What are common things I can remove to see if it helps?
He's on limited ingredient diet. We avoided grass on his walks. Pretty sure it's not the detergent for the bedding. We avoid chicken treats and he's not getting half as many. 
We have 5 cats so really hope it not them XD

0,DogAdvice,Crying/Neediness help,"Looking for advice on how to curb crying/whining and neediness in a dog.

Bit of dog background: he's a giant breed mix, I rescued him when he was 1. Horribly behaved then, unsocialised and untrained. He's now 4. Has come on in leaps and bounds, is crate trained, semi-social with other dogs and lead/house trained etc. Doing so well! He's mostly stopped jumping when people come into the house- he absolutely adores all people. 

Bit of situation background: He's always been quite needy, since I got him. It took ages for him to stop crying/destroying things when I left the house. We're down to about 2 or 3 barks and a bit of crying before he settles now (have checked cams). But I got him when I was single, and now I'm seeing someone quite seriously. We're spending time between both houses. 

Now, the dog absolutely adores my boyfriend, and the Ukrainian couple he's hosting at his house. But that's now 4 people to contend with, all with different schedules. When I'm not there during the day, they sometimes want him out of the way (when cooking etc  as he's counter height). They'll sometimes have him in a different room with his bed. 

The issue: he seems to be crying and whimpering nonstop when he's not with people, and being a big dog he produces very loud crying! I've told them to ignore it and not give him attention, but any other solutions anyone can give, or tips? Was thinking a filled Kong each day when I leave, but also don't want him having too many treats!",red-Hazel,2022-11-17,02:00:59,2022,11,17,2,0,Thursday

0,DogAdvice,Poodle spends most of the time hiding,"My family has a miniature poodle, Diego. He spends most of his time hiding. He is very smart and understands our speech a lot, so he knows when we're planning something unpleasant for him.

Diego doesn't like going on walks. He has a knee issue, but the vet said that it shouldn't be a problem. He hates harnesses and any kind of clothes, so we use a collar and it helps a bit. He obviously doesn't enjoy grooming, nail clipping etc.

He's not treated badly in any way, although he was bullied by my brother's friends when he was a puppy (I HATE those kids).

Does anyone know why he hides so much and is it possible to train him out of it? It's so sad for both him and us, that he just lays under sofas all day.",appelssinni,2022-11-16,23:58:08,2022,11,16,23,58,Wednesday

0,DogAdvice,Help with puppy fear of being alone,"Hi everyone! I just adopted a 9 week old American Staffy and he is the light of my life.
It has been only a week and honestly all my days evolve around him, even if I‚Äôm at work (like now lol) I am searching training tips or toys to get him.
Obviously since he‚Äôs a baby it has not been easy, my problem is that I live in a apartment with a roommate (I am planning on moving out soon so I don‚Äôt want my pup to get attached to them that much) and since it hasn‚Äôt been long since he got separated from his siblings and mom he hasn‚Äôt experienced being alone, and I am guilty of being with him almost 24h everyday since I got him‚Ä¶
Well I don‚Äôt know what to do to be honest, his playpen and crate stay in my room cause he‚Äôs my responsibility not my housemate (and they have their own pets too which also stay most of the time in their room) and every time I leave for work he just cries all night long ( I work night shifts). Honestly if it was just me I wouldn‚Äôt worry much cause I know i need to let him calm down by himself and give him time to get confident in being alone, but i‚Äôm worried about my housemate and my neighbors.

him be more comfortable alone please share!",Sufficient-Spirit520,2022-11-16,23:13:44,2022,11,16,23,13,Wednesday

0,DogAdvice,Why is my dog suddenly Chewing up his crate bed and lining?,"So I have a Male 13 month old corgi heeler mix, he is neutered, crate trained and housebroken. But he does have a little bit of a naughty streak. Nothing crazy he just rips up stuffed toys if he‚Äôs given them and likes to counter surf (we are working on that).

When I say crate train I mean he‚Äôs very good about his crate he has had it and the bed in it since he was a puppy, and the only time he has ever had an accident in his crate is when we switched his dog food from puppy food to adult dog food and he had some tummy trouble. But it was thoroughly cleaned and that was months ago. 

He goes in there whenever we need to leave the house, so some days he‚Äôs in there for as much as five hours but that‚Äôs pretty rare, most of the time it‚Äôs for around two or three hour. He is very used to this routine and goes into the crate very willingly usually he immediately lays down to take a nap. 

But in the last week he has ripped up the bed in his crate and then today he destroyed the plastic crate mat. In both instances he wasn‚Äôt even in the crate for that long under four hours for both. 

I‚Äôm not sure what to do about it besides get a new crate mat, I don‚Äôt really want to spray the mat with the sour spray that we use for other things we want him to leave alone because I worry that it could hurt his nose being stuck so close to it.

0,DogAdvice,Need advice: I think my neighbor stole my dog,"So this is a long story to type out - so sorry In advance for my poor grammar/spelling. Last year my family dog was stolen from our property. I live on a fairly big plot of land and my closest neighbor is 3 miles away. The last time my dog was seen, he was was in the presence of 4 women who were at my house because their husbands/brothers were working in my orchards. These women happen to be apart of a fairly big family who work on our land and are our closest neighbors. When he went missing I sent flyers everywhere, I made a report, I knocked on doors, I ask every worker if they knew anything, and posted on every social media/ lost dog site you could. Never heard anything back. About a week ago I was driving out of town (I always pass their house when leaving mine) and I saw what I believed to be my lost dog running out of their driveway. I slammed on my breaks and turned around but, by the time I got there there was no sign of him. It left a weird feeling in my stomach and I‚Äôve decided to do more digging. I found out some of the names of the people who there and found a couple social media pages - looking to see if they posted a picture w him. I found one graining video that one of the women posted and briefly a dog who looks exactly like my lost dog pans into the video. I believe he is with them but I have no idea how to prove. We have gone knocking before and they said they didn‚Äôt have any dogs - even tho I frequently see them walking other dogs. I‚Äôm not sure what to do now.

When we put him out the back and shut the screen door, it knight be to vaccum and mop or do something around the house, he sits at the back door instantly and starts whining and crying. 5 mins in, he will start trying to open the door or bite the door and this will just go on until she finally let's him in. He has a nice back yard and a big house to roam freely around. The back door is usually always open so he has access to outside and inside whenever he wants but when we need to get stuff done without tripping over him, we out him out the back and it's usually only for 30 minutes tops.

Because he's so big, when he claws the door he scratches it and damages the mesh sometimes.

The look on his face when he sits at the door is like he's in trouble or we are treating him poorly. 

Is there a way to reverse this being 7 years old?

He's got a  pretty good life and he's never miss treated but the needyness in these times of trying to clean and the damage done to the back door or side door is starring to get to me.

He has toys out the back, a large fluffy bed, grass to run around on. It doesn't seem all that bad for 30 mins?

0,DogAdvice,Dog with pancreatitis for 3 weeks now,"Hi All-

My dog was diagnosed 3 weeks ago with pancreatitis. Initially he had liquid diarrhea on Friday night before vet visit on Monday and it stayed consistent and didn‚Äôt get better over the weekend. 

On the Monday he was diagnosed and given a drug (Cerenia) at the vet. I started him on Metronidazole for 7 days and FortiFlora for 10 days. All while on a bland diet. 

I had his 2 week check up and at the vet his blood panel still showed abnormal. Their machine only shows normal or abnormal. So we continued on with the bland diet for another week. X-Ray was negative on anything noticeable. 

Yesterday (week 3) his blood work still showed abnormal but I had them also send his blood out to get a number that could possibly show the severity of it, currently waiting for those results. 

His diarrhea stopped after the cerenia shot though it was still soft and messy just not liquidated.  He doesn‚Äôt throw up and seems more active and back to himself over time. The last week or so his poop is decently firm and looks normal. 

The weird this since this all started his gut or pancreas is super loud, like it‚Äôs very audible from like 10 feet away.

0,DogAdvice,I‚Äôm thinking about getting a puppy next year but I‚Äôm worried about my jealous dog,"I have an almost 5 year old corgi and have been strongly considering getting another one next year. The problem is that my dog is very jealous. She gets jealous when my boyfriend and I give each other affection. Either she‚Äôll squeeze her way between us, nudge us until we either tell her to go on her pad or kennel or try to get in on the action with puppy kisses (which is not what you want to listen to or think about as you kiss your partner). She‚Äôll even bark at us when we hug sometimes. We‚Äôre working on fixing these problems but progress is slow and I‚Äôm not exactly sure how to stop this behavior besides having her go to her pad and only giving her attention when I decide, not when she‚Äôs trying to get my attention. 

My boyfriends mom got a puppy recently and she HATES this poor creature. She never hurt it at all or was worryingly aggressive but she completely ignored it and snarled/intimidated/snapped at it when it came to her (and they were not left alone without supervision). The motherly instinct I hope would kick in was no where to be seen. This has obviously made me worry how she will behave with a new puppy around so I was wondering if anyone has navigated a similar situation or has any advice on how to curb this behavior in preparation to getting a puppy. 

I think it might be relevant to mention she was attacked by a small dog when she was a puppy. She‚Äôs got a little scar on her nose to prove it and has been wary around smaller dogs ever since. She‚Äôs very submissive around large dogs (even having been attacked by an off leash dog on a walk a year ago, although that encounter left no injuries and the dogs were quickly split apart) but gets nervous and more on guard around small ones.",chunckysalsa99,2022-11-16,03:03:02,2022,11,16,3,3,Wednesday

0,DogAdvice,"New Rescue - Sweet and affectionate but jumps on everyone, even when they're sitting down.","Just brought home a 1-year-old Border Collie mix who recently gave birth and was spayed. She loves people and (most) other dogs. There's one habit we're trying to work on - she jumps up as a greeting.

We're going to engage a trainer shortly but would love to hear anything that worked with your pup. She's about 50 lbs so her jumping could at some point hurt someone (though I don't think she means to). She's REALLY high-energy (which can be a little scary in and of itself). If she jumps on me while I'm standing I'll just calmly walk away and do something else. If she does it while I'm sitting, I can push her off (gently) but I have to keep petting her or she tries it again. She's very demanding about affection, which is sweet ... at first. But I can't type at the computer or look at my phone as she aggressively nudges my arm to pet her again.

I'm torn between wanting to give her lots of pats and attention (because of all she's been through, to reassure her) and thinking I'm maybe encouraging some of her behavior.

I suspect when we start working a trainer and come up with some training ""games"" she'll have a place to put some of that energy. She gets multiple walks during the day (some a mile or so) and we'll be taking her to a local dog run to get some of that energy out as well.

0,DogAdvice,What do you do when you can‚Äôt get a vet appointment?,My 13 week old puppy started limping on Saturday and we can‚Äôt figure out why. We gave her two days to rest thinking she‚Äôd get better but it‚Äôs only gotten worse and now she doesn‚Äôt want to put any weight on that foot. Where I live there are only three veterinarians within a two hour drive and they‚Äôre all booked out for at least two weeks. Am I just supposed to wait two weeks and hope she gets better on her own in the meantime. I don‚Äôt know what to do and I don‚Äôt want her to be in pain for weeks until she can be seen. I‚Äôm also worried it could be the kind of injury that‚Äôs no big deal if treated immediately but could leave lifelong damage if we let it go for two weeks before we do anything.,Siltyclayloam9,2022-11-16,00:23:12,2022,11,16,0,23,Wednesday
0,DogAdvice,Concerned over my dog not wanting to eat‚Ä¶,"My dog is a whole mix of breeds (Staffordshire pit, tree walking coonhound, and lab are the main ones). He‚Äôs about 1.5 years old and has always been a very good eater. So much so that when he was a pup we used a slow feeder. 

Recently, he had this mass on his foot that got very red and infected. We took him to the vet and they gave us antibiotics and anti inflammatory pills. He hates the pills (they smell like a fart) and we‚Äôve been shoving them down his throat for about a month now after every meal. The mass on his foot is almost gone (just some scabbing/scar tissue left), but for the last couple of days he‚Äôs been completely uninterested in his breakfast or dinner. He still takes treats and snacks but just licks all the kibble in his bowl during meals. I have to hand feed him the food because he has to take the pills with food in his stomach. 

So I‚Äôm wondering if the reason my dog isn‚Äôt eating is because he‚Äôs now associated meal time with getting 3 pills shoved down his throat. The pills run out tomorrow morning and the vet doesn‚Äôt want to see him unless the bump on his paw comes back. Should I just wait and see if his behavior changes after the pills stop or is this something I should address sooner rather than later?",CrownOfPosies,2022-11-16,00:17:51,2022,11,16,0,17,Wednesday

0,DogAdvice,Will my dog still like me after being gone for 2 or 3 years?,"I have a dog whom I absolutely love. She helps me so much everyday with my anxiety. She's a sweetheart. The thing is, I would like to take my Master's abroad. There is this really interesting programme that will last a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 3 years. It's exactly what I want, but I'm terrified of leaving my dog with my parents and then, upon my return, finding out she doesn't really care for me anymore. If I indeed do my Master's abroad, I would make arrangements in order to go home for the entire duration of my vacation (so about 2 and a half months in the Winter and 3 months in the Summer) and I'm also planning on visiting home every 2 and a half months each semester for various reasons. In a way, I think I would still be able to provide my dog a lot of quality time with me, but I spend *a lot* more time with her now. I fear she might forget about me or, at the very least, lose interest in me. Upon my return I intend to find a job in my home country and get a house, to where I'd take my dog so she could live with me and finally be totally reunited.

For the sake of brevity I‚Äôll leave all the details out but happy to provide any that may be helpful. But every few month we were having episodes of gastroenteritis that would land him at the emergency vet. A recent episode evolved into HGE and then this most recent one just started as HGE

I understand they cause isn‚Äôt really known but the vet said with as often as these episodes are happening there has to be some underlying condition. We did all the blood panels - all came back in acceptable ranges. We are now trying a strict diet. Essentially just hydrolized protein food. No treats at all. I have no way to know if it‚Äôs working. If he has another episode in a couple of months it‚Äôs not. Otherwise it may be. The only other test she has mentioned is a ultrasound to check the thickness of intestinal lining. The only other I can think it maybe running high stress is a contributing factor. He has been on a calming probiotic for quite some time. 

Has anyone been through something similar with other ideas? I would love to hear if anyone has ideas or similar experience

0,DogAdvice,My dog intermittently has blood in her urine and idk what it could be.,"I‚Äôm taking her to the vet again tomorrow so I‚Äôm not looking for any kind of diagnosis.  Just wondering if anyone here might have suggestions of what could be happening or anything to ask the vet about.  Yes, I know google exists, but I‚Äôm trying to avoid some panic scrolling and vague articles.

Context:
The first time she had blood was a few years ago and the tests showed that she had struvite crystals in her bladder.  We put her on an Rx diet - Royal Canin Urinary SO - which did the trick until we moved and it was difficult to get an Rx from her new vet as her X-rays didn‚Äôt show any crystals.
She was fine for a while until a few months ago when she started bleeding again.  We had X-rays and a urinalysis done, but there were neither crystals nor bacteria found.  The vet put her on a round of a general antibiotic -  Clavamox - and everything seemed fine.
That is, until today when she had an accident in the house and there was a considerable amount of blood.

She is about 4.5-5 years old, Pit mix, vaccinated.

my dad has a habit of empathizing with rudy, saying ‚Äúhis ass must hurt‚Äù and ‚Äúpoor guy‚Äù. when i say that we could do something about it, such as start looking around for other vets and second and third opinions- he refuses, saying it will be a waste. it is my impression that he has given up on rudy‚Äôs chance of a better life.

0,DogAdvice,First time mom nibbling 3 month old puppies,"My 4 yo Blue-Heeler/Shepherd/Lab mix had her first litter (with an Aussie we chose). We are keeping two pups from the litter and have a third for a family member we have held onto until we can travel to them. 

Mom has done alright with the litter, does't like them as we thought she would (she's been VERY maternal towards human babies). For context, she's a very gentle and patient alpha, and has done very well with other's puppies. When she's needed to set boundaries she does a great job at communicating with other dogs and the puppies before doing anything physical like nipping. 

Our puppies play hard, sometimes I'm concerned a little too aggressively, and recently Mom has started nibbling on her puppies when they're playing. She's done it for a bit outside of them playing, nibbling on their chest or neck (cobbing I guess its called). Recently, however, she has started doing it while they're playing, and started biting (gently) at one of their back legs. What causes me concern is that its always on whichever dog is being picked on. Since theres three pups, two can gang up on another, but this actually happens less frequently than one of the pups just bullying one of the others. Mom was raised with one of her littermates for about 2.5 years, and when she played with him she would always ""win"" by yanking the back leg out from under her brother, so we have seen this behavior from her before except she doesn't do it as extremely with the puppies.

The times where I have seen Mom join in have been both when they seem to be playing at what I deem an appropriate level of ""aggressive"" and when they've been ""too aggressive."" She will nibble on them and sometimes bite a back leg, but always on the pup thats being bullied.   


Should I be concerned? She has never hurt another dog in her life, but it concerns me that she's doing it on the pup who is being bullied. I'm trying to determine if the pups are being truly ""too aggressive"" and if so I plan to separate them when they are. They all have their own crates. Not sure when to have the pups stopped and not sure if mom is playing healthily or being a bully.   


Any advise on any of the things is welcome.",Organized_Chaos_x,2022-11-15,03:20:24,2022,11,15,3,20,Tuesday
0,DogAdvice,Re home one dog or both,"Long story short‚Ä¶. But still kinda long. 
I have a 15 year old male Doxie mix and a 13.5 year old female westie. They‚Äôve been together with our family for 12 years. Unfortunately the doxie can‚Äôt be around my kids anymore. He‚Äôs just old and a little grumpy and my 2.5 year old is a human tornado.  He also bit my wife recently. Most out of fear because he was trying to get away from the 2 year old and jumped on my 6 month old baby and my wife grabbed him pretty aggressively. Regardless we can‚Äôt have him in the house and worry about if he‚Äôll bite my wife or kids in the future. 

I‚Äôve tried a lot of different options to manage having old dogs, little kids and a wife who doesn‚Äôt have the bandwidth for dogs, but the reality is the Doxie can‚Äôt be with the family any more. 

Fortunately I live 2 min from my parents house and they can take care of the Doxie but I‚Äôm torn on what to do with my Westie. She‚Äôs just a sweet lazy old dog who gets along with the kids and is just low maintnance in general. 

Do you think it‚Äôs better to keep both dogs together and have them live at my parents house or have my Doxie live with my parents and The Westie live with us. 

The tough thing for me is, I love both of the dogs a bunch and they both really prefer my company over anyone else in the family. I don‚Äôt want to call them therapy dogs but they both at times a have provided me with a lot of comfort and affection.

0,DogAdvice,My dog seems to hate my grandparents,"So my family dog turned 2 on the the 12th of November. He is a fairly well behaved dog and very understanding in many situations. He is also very friendly, whenever anyone comes to visit he always wants to go them and play with them (ofc not everyone likes dogs so we only allow him to go to everyone once they r comfortable. All in all he isn‚Äôt aggressive just extremely playful.

My grandparents came to visit us and are staying for a month, but my dog just doesn‚Äôt seem to like em. Since the second they entered our house till now (2 whole days) he barks at their every move and even if he hears any noise made by them whether it is talking or sneezing or burping. 

This is very surprising cause he has never done this to anyone before, not even the guests he has never seen before. 

My mom and I think he may have sensed our hatred to our grandparents and is reacting the same way (yeah, my mom and I hate my dads parents cause they think they are more superior than us and tend to degrade my mom a lot).

Is there a way to get him more comfortable with them?
We have tried taking him for a walk with them,  made my grandparents ignore him, consoled him that we are fine and also given him the firm commands to listen which he usually listens to but not this time.

What do I do to get him to calm down and be normal again?

0,DogAdvice,Should I keep shark tooth 2 mo old away from u socialized 2 yr old?,"You might have seen me spamming the sub about my little Golden and I appreciate all the advice I get here. 

I have a 2 year old Bichon who is *very* excitable and darts around when having fun. She isn't aggressive, more so timid until she is comfortable with you. 

She has been extremely tolerant of my 2 month old pup, which seems to be instinctual. So it isn't my Bichon I'm worried about bringing harm. 


Golden goes for the eyes, man. She is nothing by teeth and will nip every near her mouth. Anytime we tried to let them play, she just wants to bite Bichon. 

I *can* tell when either of them want to stop play or need space.. so it isn't that Golden is upset. This is just how she plays, as I assume puppies this age do. 

Bichon doesn't react with biting of tail or paws usually but she does get hurt and squeak, which is when I usually have to stop play. 


Also, I'm not sure if my Bichon knows how to correct the Golden? I don't know if that's really a thing dogs do at these ages.. I see her put her head over Golden and sometimes boop her with paw or snoot after being bitten. But other than that, I'm too scared of Golden taking an eye to let Bichon figure things out with her. 


Some online trainers say to just keep them separated until Golden is more matured. Other say that it's important to let them do this. 

But dude those teeth fucking her and Golden has just been really trying to get my Bichon's eyes. 


They both want to play with each other. I don't want to hinder their relationship. What did you do with your dogs?",MetforminShits,2022-11-14,01:40:05,2022,11,14,1,40,Monday

0,DogAdvice,byGoing inside right after going outside: is it revenge?,"Our golden doodle Snoopy is 1y3m and has started more regularly leaving drops of poo after we pen him into the basement or behind a baby gate. 

A bit of backstory, we adopted him when he turned 1 in August, as his current parents were expecting at the time and couldn't sufficiently take care of him. He was completely matted, and suffered from anxiety being stuck at home in a mud room while both parents worked all day.

He has improved a lot and is doing well in our new dog training class! Still is very anxious about meeting new people but he is so full of love and joy with people he knows.

We tend to spend weekends at our parents house in the basement, which Snoopy loves as there are so many windows to see squirrels out of. Lately though, if we happen to need to leave him at home at our parents house (which he loves, it's a bit larger than our own), he will poop within 15 minutes of us penning him into the basement. I've tried going on walks for 15-30 minutes outside with him and he does seem to relieve himself completely right before we leave... He still has consistently left a pile right after we leave. 

I've heard some people say this might be ""revenge poo"" for leaving him alone and not taking him with us. He loves knowing where everyone is at and will routinely patrol the house and check all the windows when we're chilling at home. I can only think it has to do with anxiety, which I feel horrible about because especially for church there's nobody to stay home with him. Thankfully my wife works remotely and loves having him around, but for the times when we are both gone I can't imagine how hard it is for him.

Not really sure what to do at this point... Maybe we need to walk him for longer before leaving? Maybe he needs a smaller space to feel better? He's about 70 pounds so i don't want him to feel cramped either. Any thoughts would be appreciated, specially if I'm doing something wrong. My parents were not good examples when it came to pets, so I'm wanting to do everything possible to help Snoopy in the right ways.

0,DogAdvice,Dog Mauling,"Hello all! This is my first real post on Reddit so please bear with me. Idk if this is the right place to post but I need advice. I also want to say this event happed three years ago and I am just finding out about it now.

I have a dog who‚Äôs 10months. We aren‚Äôt sure what she is but we think shes a jack russle America bulldog mix. She‚Äôs very active and an amazing cuddle buddy. We love her but she is not the true reason I am posting. 

Today my partner and I were looking up  the trainer my parents recommend to us. We last minute needed a place to have her stay as we scored concert tickets. 

My parents swear by this guy and I have had a few training session with him and my dog and they were amazing. He clearly knows what he‚Äôs doing. His level of knowledge and experience is astounding. He‚Äôs trained both my parents German Shepard‚Äôs. My little 20lb dog seems like a cake walk for this trainer. 

Now here‚Äôs the problem: 

Today we searched his name in our city and right under his dog training website we saw a very concerning article. It detailed that a young teenager was mauled by four dogs that were this trainers dogs. He was paying this young man to feed and check on the dogs and was found mauled to death while the trainer was out of the country. It was clearly stated that our trainer gave up all his rights and was nothing but helpful in the investigation. The four dogs were euthanized. 

I don‚Äôt know how to feel. It‚Äôs a shock to know my dog is with him for the rest of the weekend and I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I thought I trusted him but this really makes me feel uncomfortable. I know he wasn‚Äôt even in the country when this happened and those dogs are no longer around but all I want to do is ditch my plans and go get my dog. 

Could someone give me advice? I really love this guy and have a tremendous amount of respect for him. When I googled him this was not what I was expecting.",Popcornshrimp111,2022-11-13,13:21:04,2022,11,13,13,21,Sunday
0,DogAdvice,Heart rate question,"I have a one year old shih-poo I‚Äôve noticed she has been a bit lethargic lately, i thought it was because we‚Äôve been going on longer walks, but today I checked her heart rate and it doesn‚Äôt go higher than 80-88bpm, after googling apparently a dog her size should have 120-160 bpm‚Ä¶ (I checked by feeling her heart rate with my fingers) 

She is a picky eater and sometimes doesn‚Äôt eat all the amount of food she should for daily value, could this be affecting her heart rate? 

Other than that she looks happy when playing or going on our walks, drinking water, normal potty business. 

I‚Äôm setting up an appointment for her to get seen, but I am freaking out while waiting‚Ä¶

0,DogAdvice,Should I rehome my dog to my parents?,"I‚Äôve had my dog, Echo, for about 2.5 years now. I got him when I was 21, the summer before my senior year of college. I am now in grad school and am starting a job full time in December. I love my dog with all of my heart - he has kept me alive through some really tough times in my life. However, my dog has some behavioral issues, and I am worried I am not giving him the life he deserves (I have three jobs and am in school full-time) and that I will not be able to do so when I start my new full-time job (I will be gone about 10 hours per day and he must be crated because he is destructive when I‚Äôm gone but he hates his crate no matter how much crate training I try to do with him - he even runs away from me every time I call him in the house because he is afraid I am going to put him away). Because of this I feel like I can‚Äôt leave my house for more than four hour at a time, but I have depression and anxiety and do the worst when I am home all day. Echo is reactive with new people, certain dogs, and with certain random triggers and has nipped people many times (he nipped my roommate the other day when they were moving a microwave, nips at me when I try to kill bugs, nips at people when they come up behind me). I moved to a house with a big yard so he and my roommate‚Äôs dog could run around and play and they do for hours a day but she is not home all the time and her schedule changes frequently. I have been to trainers and have talked to my vet about his reactivity but nothing seems to help. I am doing the absolute best I can with him and walk him on trails near my house but he has a crazy amount of energy (he is a shepherd beagle mix) and i feel like it is never enough as even after an hour walk he will bark at me to play with him. I am constantly anxious about him being near my roommates because I am afraid something new will trigger him and he will nip or even really bite one of them. My parents live in a big house on 35 acres and have another dog that he gets along with. My mom works from home and my dad is home and outside a lot so Echo could run around outside most of the time and there are not many people that come to their house and he does not have to be crated there because there is no roommates stuff around for him to tear up. I know they would give him a good life but I am not sure I can bear to part with him because I love him so much. What should I do? This decision has been eating me up and I feel guilty and anxious about both options.",amc5678,2022-11-13,11:15:09,2022,11,13,11,15,Sunday

0,DogAdvice,Corgi obsessed with icecubes??? Is this normal?,"Hi fellas. I'm the owner of a one year old cardigan corgi. In all aspects she is a perfectly normal dog, she's a healthy weight, she's energetic, playful, extremely curious, but as of late she has this really weird fixation on icecubes. 

She will beg relentlessly when I'm getting the icecube tray out of the freezer. She will sit next to me and put her paw on my foot over and over, like it's a treat I'm holding. If I ignore her, she'll jump up and even bark because she wants them so bad. If I give her one, she'll chew it until it's all gone. She'll even fetch for them or do tricks. It just has me really baffled because... Is it really that rewarding for her? I don't understand what in her head makes her want them so bad, it's just water after all. Tonight, she was upstairs with another member of the house, and I was making a drink with ice. I got the tray out, and as soon as I did that, she BOLTED downstairs, like straight up running. But if I were to let's say open the treat drawer, she probably wouldn't come running unless I shook the bag and shouted her name.

I also want to ask if this is okay to humor or if I should nip it in the bud? I don't know if they're good for her teeth or not. She is a very chewing dog, tears through chew toys really fast, chews through some household things. Not as bad as when she was a little puppy but she definetely enjoys it. I feel like she chews less after being given an icecube but I could totally be placeboing myself there. As of the moment she gets one icecube a day at the max. On average I'd say every couple of days, since y'know, don't need ice as much in the winter. Is this okay to entertain? Is there any reason she might be so attached to them? Am I overthinking a dog just being a weird dog? I'd appreciate any advice, thank you and have a nice day :)",DeadRisingLover,2022-11-13,10:07:43,2022,11,13,10,7,Sunday

0,DogAdvice,Why does my middle dog go after my new dog when my new dog is playing with our other dog?,"I have 3 dogs. 

2 year old basenji 
6 year old small hound mix
And 13year old elderly bully

The hound and bully have been living together for the last 5 years or so. The bully is dog selective but has gotten along very well with the hound and basenji. She is significantly bigger than the other 2 dogs. The basenji and hound are nearly the same size - slightly different but similar. 

Anyway, whenever the basenji and bully play or start getting riled up (play) the hound mix will immediately run up to the bully and growl on her and almost attack her - this has actually led to one fight between the bully and hound. The hound mix will ALSO bark aggressively (but not attacking) the basenji who then runs away doing zoomies. 

But basically the hound mix will ALWAYS intervene whenever my basenji and bully play! I do keep the hound mix away from the other 2 dogs because her behavior is not reliable or safe especially after that one fight. 

But I have no clue why she reacts that way. Her hair is raised and she immediately goes directly up to the bully and growls in her face (anyway the bully is deaf but it‚Äôs not like my other dogs know that).

Does anyone have any explanations on **why** this is happening? So far I‚Äôm working on subthreshold desensitizing training with the hound mix slowly and also removing her from the area if necessary as to not trigger her further. I just don‚Äôt know **why**?!

And PS. The basenji and hound play a LOT. The basenji and bully play as well. And the hound and bully play too but not as much.",agreementloop184,2022-11-13,05:12:46,2022,11,13,5,12,Sunday

If I sit down, he wants to sit with me but digs at my leg incessantly (ow).

If I try to play with him (cuz I figure he's bored), he ignores the toys and barks at me like I'm trying to murder him.

If I leave him alone, he walks over and continues to bark at me until I leave his line of sight, but then he *follows me and continues barking.*

He also tries to hump me every time I stand up. Any advice on how to stop that would also be appreciated bc verbal reprimands get barking, distraction with toys gets barking, and I just have to leave line of sight again for him to stop and it doesn't seem productive.

I'm currently hiding in the bathroom (again) like some survival horror game. He just paces the door and whines. What does he want from me?

0,DogAdvice,My dog is broken.,"My wife and I got a 3 y/o male beagle from a rescue back in June and he hates me. He always has. He was super nervous the first few weeks we had him, but we assumed this was just because he was settling in. A month goes by and he fully settles in with my wife. When I'm at work, he plays with her, lays with her, follows her, and even learns how to sit. Every day I come home it's the same old story. He howls when he hears my car pull up, he barks when I come through the door, he poops and pees wherever he is standing when I walk into the living room, and then he runs and hides in his crate.

We then assumed he may have been abused by a man, after all, he was a hunting dog and given up because ""he wasn't good at hunting."" However, my wife and I went on vacation for a week and during this time, we left him with a petsitter. I warned the petsitter that he might have some really bad anxiety when her husband was home to the point that me might bark and defecate himself. To my relief, she said this was no problem. However, during our trip the sitter sent me several pictures and videos of our dog sitting in her husband's lap, kissing him, and playing with him. It was very sweet, but it also broke my heart.

I've given nothing but kindness to this dog. I give him treats, I make his meals, I take him on his walks, I lay by his crate and scratch his ears and chin. And yet, nothing seems to work. It's been five months now and this dog has made little to no progress with me. I am writing this right now while my wife bathes him because he just pooped all over himself after I tried to take him outside.

I would've given him away to someone I know personally who would take care of him had my wife not already grown so attached to him. I don't know what to do at this point. I've been given so much advice from family, friends, and our local vet and nothing seems to work. Can anybody please tell me what I'm doing wrong or something I can do that I haven't already been told?",Grunge_Gaming,2022-11-12,22:26:50,2022,11,12,22,26,Saturday

0,DogAdvice,My puppy isn't interested in me,"We have a 11 week old American Akita puppy. He gets excited around strangers and wants cuddles but rarely accepts them from us which is very unlike the breed in general. Oftentimes he will move away when I come to him for cuddles and just move to then sleep half a foot away from me. Then on other days he will follow me around the apartment to see what I'm doing. He doesn't seem too excited to see us , barely wagging his tail and only coming towards us if we call him,  though he always just wants to play with us. It's kind of sad because I'm used to dogs going crazy around me and falling asleep on my lap but no , not with this one. He doesn't like being on the sofa/ lap or really too close. I assumed it's because it's too warm for him but a dog who never actively seeks affection?  Did I pick the wrong dog? 
I wont ever give him away but it's saddening because I wanted a dog to cuddle and be there with me, not a roommate who bites me regularly ( i assume sometimes because he doesn't get his way or I misinterpret playful behaviour ) .

0,DogAdvice,Is it normal to just be sleep deprived for 4-6 months or am I doing something wrong with this puppy?," I adopted an 2 month old golden retriever last weekend and she will be 3 months tomorrow. 

My first dog, who is now 2, was admittedly neglected in training and it took a while for us to potty train her. But it was ""easier"" when she was a puppy because I just ignored her and let her do what she wanted, while sleeping with us. 


I learned my lesson and want to do things right (while also training my 2 yr old). Which right now means not a single drop of pee on the carpet and she *will* be crate trained.

But for fuck sake I haven't slept more than maybe 3 hours a night since I got her. Some nights I just don't fucking sleep at all.

She is sleeping in bed with us, which I can already hear you all screaming. But it was advised by a YT trainer and her breeder to have her sleep with us at first to help ease her transition.

The thought is that she is still too young to really be trained or get what I'm trying to do and right now I need to focus on building her confidence and security. 

However, I think this is contributing to me losing sleep. Because it would be one thing if I just had to get up ever 2 or 3 hours for 10 minutes then go right back to bed. But she wakes up, bites me and fucks around, I bring her back to bed, then she bites and and fucks around for like fucking 15 minutes! Then I just can't sleep. 



I am crate training in the day time, she is at the point where she will voluntarily go into her crate for space sometimes. She will stay there when I put her in during a nap but she has to already be asleep. Today I tried putting her in as she was falling asleep and closing the door. She didn't like that, of course. 


So that's what I'm doing about crate training, in hopes that she will soon just sleep in there at night and that will solve the Potty Play Time issue. 

One thing that is giving me comfort is that she seems very smart and is extremely food motivated so training isn't that difficult... her recall is pretty perfect already, and I don't even need to use food anymore. 

So think the only obstacle with crate training or stuff that requires some separation from me is that she is just *so* attached to me. I can't leave the room without her losing her shit. 



Anyway, is it typical and expected to be sleep deprived when they're this young? I feel like I've never seen anyone mention it.

I'm sure this is a crating issue but whatever advice you got, lay it on me. I could really use the encouragement too. 

She's really only got a couple more months until she sleeps through the night.. it just feels like torture being woken up by needle teeth right when I finally fall asleep!",MetforminShits,2022-11-12,11:55:34,2022,11,12,11,55,Saturday
0,DogAdvice,Big Dog trying to eat Small Dog's food,"I recently moved in with my boyfriend and we both have dogs. I have a big catahoula (f) and he has a little pomeranian (m). My dog has never really liked going into bathrooms once she learned that's where baths happen and she hates baths. But recently I've been catching her trying to get into the bathroom from time to time.

Why is this a problem? Because the bathroom is where my boyfriend's dog's stuff is. His bed, his toys, his water, and his food.

My dog gets fed 2 times a day and she eats all of her food within a few minutes. She loves food. Actually the only thing so far I know she *won't* eat is lettuce. My boyfriend's dog, however, has his bowl filled and we just fill it again once it's all gone. He seems to only want to eat when people are in the bathroom with him.

The food he had before started running out, and my boyfriend wasn't sure what food he's been eating (I think someone else bought the food for him) so we've started switching him to new food. It just so happens that the new food is the same brand as my dog's food. And I think my dog has been trying to get into the bathroom since we started giving his dog the new food. We're wondering if she smells something familiar and is trying to get to it because of that.

After getting home today from driving my boyfriend to work, I noticed his dog's food was entirely gone. Which would be impossible knowing how he eats and that I had refilled the bowl just maybe 2 hours or so earlier. The bowl was also in a weird spot, pushed up against the wall and his water bowl as if it had been nudged there, like when my dog eats and her bowl shifts. And my dog was acting super guilty when I got home, so I know she did it.

That's long winded, sorry. But basically I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas on how to get my dog to leave his food alone. I don't want her over eating or eating food made for small breeds since she definitely is not one. The only thing I can think of right now is to set up a crate and put his food in the crate. Maybe the opening would be too small for her head and she wouldn't be able to get to it. Right now, I'm just having to keep the bathroom door closed unless we (my boyfriend or I) are going in, since that's the only time his dog seems to eat anyway. But I hate keeping him from his toys and water and such.

tl;dr- big dog is starting to eat small dog's food. need a way to keep her away from the small dog's food, especially when we're not home.",MochaNeko,2022-11-12,11:10:39,2022,11,12,11,10,Saturday

0,DogAdvice,Dog wants personal space when lying down. Personal preference or indicator of mistreatment before we had him?,"We adopted a dog about a month ago. He's estimated to be about ten years old. He follows commands well, is well behaved, loving and in general an easy dog to have around. That said, he had a couple of triggers.

1. When he's lying down her doesn't want people in his space. He doesn't mind me so much (who he is attached to) but he gives the kids a warning yelp when they linger too close to him (notably near his face).
2. He doesn't allow anyone to examine his feet. We believe this is associated with arthritis, but even if not it seems understandable.

The guidance we've given to the kids is, listen we know he has two clearly defined rules. Respect them, and we'll keep enjoying him. Disrespect them, and there will be no trust from him and the warning yelp could lead to a warning bite.

0,DogAdvice,I need help deciding.,"Risks vs benefits. Spaying age/right time.

Small info blurb. Sweet girl is a German Shepherd, dalmation, great pyrenees mix. She's about 7.5 months old. The vet brought up getting her spayed and he wanted it done right away, like last month. I knew enough to know that larger breeds should wait. So, we started researching. I know that it's generally RECOMMENDED to wait until at least 2. However, we had decided to wait until after her first heat and go from there. We found that Mammory cancer was the big risk factor for waiting. Chances went up to like 8 percent waiting for first heat, increasing largely to 26 percent if we wait until after her second heat. So we HAD planned to get her spayed in the new year after her first heat after reading that large breeds typically go into heat their first time between 9-12 months. Well, 7 months and here's her first heat. Which if we were to get her spayed before her second heat, she would barely be a year old. And I'm iffy about that. 

So. Here's where I need help. IS Mammory cancer such a big risk that spaying based on heat cycles it worth it MORE than age? Or are the benefits of waiting until she's 2, out weight the risks of Mammory cancer? 

I know that it's so that the hormones can help her grow properly. That hip and bone problems become an issue when spayed earlier. But is that a reason to wait, when Mammory cancer is such a risk?

Her dogs constantly come in the kitchen and jump up on the counters and lick the food off of the dishes in the sink and lick the countertops. And lick off people's plates at the dinner table. My dog knows or at least knew to stay out of the kitchen she does not anymore and is now trying to jump up on the counters even though I continue to correct her. All of her training there is now gone because she's just following the other two dogs. 

Her dogs constantly bark and growl and fight, I know that sometimes when dogs play they look vicious but these dogs are actually growling like they're fighting I can tell the difference. She lets it go on for too long and aside from being dangerous to the dogs it's extremely loud and distracting and my dog gets mixed up in it often. 

It was agreed before we moved in together that all of the dogs would be sleeping in our respective bedrooms but that has not happened and I believe is now not going to happen because of the size of her dogs kennels. She says they take up too much space in her room so she's going to just leave them in the main living room. I want to keep my dog separate but she knows that the other two dogs are out there and she constantly whines and cries and I cannot lock her in the other room because the two dogs are in the living room and she can hear them. So if we're out in the kitchen and need the dogs locked away my dog is now in the back barking because she knows the other two dogs are still in the kitchen/living area.


Those are the biggest issues right now I guess, my biggest thing is how do I not ruin my dogs training while we are in this living situation and how do I handle my dogs jealousy at her dogs? 

And how do I keep my dog listening to me??? My dog is obviously gravitating towards the person with less rules and more treats for doing nothing. Also my dog will sit in my room and lick her paws until the fur comes off because she can hear the other dogs playing outside constantly.

0,DogAdvice,How to deal with waiting with cancer diagnosis?,"My SO (38M) and I (30F) have had dogs since we got together almost eleven years ago. SO is very attached to them and has a very hard time processing things such as sickness or pain when they are involved.

One of the pups (7F) has bone cancer, found out a couple days ago. He has been calling everywhere and got a date set to start the oncology work on the 15th. He‚Äôd like it sooner but that was after calling all oncology clinics in the state.

The thing is, it‚Äôs eating away at her leg bone and he can‚Äôt handle the stress of sitting around with that knowledge. After we get her in on the 15th we have to wait another week or so to set surgery and then another two weeks to start chemo. And he can‚Äôt function, knowing it could metastasize. There isn‚Äôt any way to get it fixed sooner. On top of all this, the vet says we will only have a few months to a year with her after all this. Not much chance of remission.

She‚Äôs on pain meds now but the leg is lame and it‚Äôs killing him to look at her. It kills me too but I‚Äôd rather focus on ways to alleviate her pain than crumbling in a similar way and not being able to help.

What can I say to him to help him be okay with the inevitable? Or is there any kind of process that can speed this up? I‚Äôm guessing no, there isn‚Äôt, but I have to keep trying. Thanks for reading.",dogwalker_livvia,2022-11-11,22:56:17,2022,11,11,22,56,Friday

0,DogAdvice,my mom wont stop getting dogs and theyre going to kill eachother,"Ok so to start this off my mom(F37) has a savior complex when it comes to dogs but when she gets tired of them after like 2 weeks she basically has me(F19) handle and take care of them.  Its usually just me home since my mom works 2 jobs, i have a full time job as well and my boyfriend(M19) lives here working full time. She has 6 dogs, 3 queensland heelers, a pitbull, a labrador, and a german shepard. My boyfriend and I have one little chihuahua who sleeps and eats in a crate and is house trained after only having her for afew months. my mom keeps getting these dogs who are mostly working dogs and just throwing them in the yard essentially. She doesnt get them any toys or ever plays with them or walks them so they are just in the yard very antsy all the time. This leads them to be very destructive to our house and eachother. She lets them all sleep in the house and every day when theres poop all over the house it is my responsibility to pick it up or if they eat the food off the counter I have to clean up the mess. We have goats as well and the dogs (mostly GS) have killed/injured multiple of our goats to which my mom will not seek veterinary care or make me help her throw away a dead goat. My moms queensland heelers and the german shepard all bite and growl and are very dog aggressive. I have been bit by my moms heeler at least 3 times unprovoked. 2 of the heelers are both VERY aggressive if you try to put them outside, if you come near them or try to grab their collar while the slider is open they WILL bite you and even if you are at a spot you think they cant reach theyll still reach their stubby little head down to bite you. My moms german shepard barks constantly and i was able to convince her to buy a bark collar but she also bites very severely and is dog aggressive towards the pitbull mostly but all of the other dogs. If me and my boyfriend buy any toys for the dogs or anything the german shepard will not let the dogs play with them she will circle and bark at them until they react and she has a reason to bite/attack them. The pitbull and the GS get into it pretty often(the pitbull isnt fixed and the GS is dog aggressive) and usually they scuffle and it sorts itself out then theyll be fine but there has been afew occasions that they get really messed up. This started pretty severely when i was 16 and it was most of the time just me home after school when the GS and pit would start trying to kill each other. Multiple times i have had to have my friends/family come attempt to break up the dog fights. but anyways this leads us to now they are in one of their hating eachother fits but the GS really really messed up the pit and one of the heelers joined in and chewed the back of her legs practically raw. My mom will not seek veterinary care. I have tried to get my mom to train them, ive offered to split the cost of crates for all of them, and i dont know what much else i can do. I know she will not get rid of them, i think the GS is the main source of the aggression and if we took her to the pound or gave her away that alone will make the situation much better. at this point i feel like it's either get rid of the GS or the pit is going to get killed and she is very sweet. only aggressive when aggression is shown to her but i think thats just because shes unfixed(we are getting her fixed next month i managed to convince my mom) but i just dont know what to do. I know she wont get rid of any of the dogs and she wont spend any money on them but i am trying to buy a new car and move out of my moms house and those arent even my dogs to begin with. My chihuahua has toys and is well taken care of because i have the time and resources for her but i can only afford the expenses of one dog and I dont want my moms dogs to die.",pukeemonster,2022-11-11,10:23:51,2022,11,11,10,23,Friday
0,DogAdvice,Need help chatting with roommate about my dog,"I have a one year old lab who is extremely high energy. She‚Äôs taken on at least an hour of walks a day with plenty of time to sniff. I was pretty good about training her for a while but I went away for two months so my parents watched her. 

I came back and noticed she had developed some behavior problems. The main issue is she jumps on people. Not everyone but just people she hasn‚Äôt seen in a while.

I‚Äôve been having some problems with my roommate aggressively shoving and scolding my dog. My dog never pays any attention to my roommate besides an occasional sniff. Today he walked in and went to his room and my dog was following him when he shoved her face away. She wasn‚Äôt even touching him. Later today she was just sniffing him and he once again aggressively shoved her then yelled ‚Äúno‚Äù. I confronted him and told him he doesn‚Äôt need to yell at her because she wasn‚Äôt doing anything. He said ‚Äúwell you don‚Äôt do anything about it‚Äù. 

I‚Äôve been working on training her the last few days and I‚Äôm not going to pretend she‚Äôs a perfect dog at all but I just don‚Äôt know what to say to my roommate to get him to stop scolding and shoving my dog cause obviously I‚Äôm not cool with that.

0,DogAdvice,My dog is ruining my mental health,"My dog is a sharpei/chow mix who is estimated to be about 10 or 11 years old right now. We adopted our boy in 2016 when he was about 5. 2016 to 2020 were great years. 2020 he got attacked by a loose dog. 2020 he also had his first vestibular episode (unrelated to the attack). 2021 another vestibular episode which took away his ability to jump on and off our bed. 2022 he had another episode and his balance is pretty wonky now. He developed bad anxiety (panting and pacing). After lots of vet visits and test treatments with anxiety medicine, it was determined that he likely has a brain lesion or tumor to explain his odd behavior and his hair trigger anxiety. :(

The medicine he is on now seems to help him act more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù but I‚Äôve accepted that he‚Äôll never be the 2016-2020 version of himself. Trazadone helps keep his anxiety at bay. He still has panting episodes though if there is any change in routine. Melatonin at night to help him sleep and an nsaid to help his arthritis because his back legs are stiff. 

Honestly, this last year it has been so stressful to own a dog. I would never ever re-home him and I‚Äôm definitely not wishing for anything to happen to him. I just feel trapped and my mental health has seriously plummeted. I want to cherish the years we have left but sometimes it‚Äôs hard when he gives me anxiety! 

Any slight change in routine and he gets super anxious. I‚Äôm not kidding, my husband and I literally have to ‚Äúassume position‚Äù at the end of the night on the couch with him. If we don‚Äôt, he will pace and pant. For example, last weekend I laid down for a nap at 6:30 pm in my bed which was not normal for him. He paced the entire time I was trying to lay down in the bedroom because I wasn‚Äôt in the living room like ‚Äúnormal‚Äù when the evening came. 

My husband has to sleep on the couch with him at night and then sneak off to bed with me after he falls asleep. We have to plan out when to give him Trazadone if we decide to go out in the evening. If we stay home, it‚Äôs always 7:30 pm but we can‚Äôt always be home at that time. Our sex life revolves around if he is asleep or outside.

To top it off, all of these issues started at the beginning of this year which is also when I found out I‚Äôm pregnant. I‚Äôm currently weeks away from birth and he has ruined my mental health and made my pregnancy so stressful. I have to tip toe around his anxiety otherwise he pants and paces. He is in for a rude awakening when the baby is here because I can‚Äôt promise his routine will stay the same each and everyday. 

We tried Xanax and it gave him a HORRIBLE reaction that landed him in the ER. We tried natural remedies and that does nothing. 

My husband is less inclined to think it‚Äôs his time. He‚Äôs willing to wait til he‚Äôs on his last leg but the amount of times this dog has made me cry or given me a panic attack in the last year is insane. He will never be his old self again. Bringing our baby home soon is stressing me out all because of him. 

I know this may sound like there is no quality to his life but there is. He uses the bathroom no problem. He eats and drinks. He still loves going outside and going on walks, even though we can‚Äôt walk as long now. Our vet told us it will be time when he stops doing what he loves. 

I guess I‚Äôm just looking for similar stories and advice on how to cope with a stressful senior pet. It‚Äôs so challenging to feel trapped and feel guilty for feeling trapped. I‚Äôve debated many times if euthanasia is the best option but it feels like murder since physically he is fine and when he‚Äôs happy, it‚Äôs great. I‚Äôve never experienced this with a dog to the point that my mental health is affected and my home doesn‚Äôt feel peaceful unless it‚Äôs on his terms.",Natsouppy,2022-11-11,05:30:15,2022,11,11,5,30,Friday

This is actually an improvement, because he used to softly growl at them (it was an unsure of them thing, not an intimidation thing). So to get him to stop growling at them, I would praise him for finding them (based on his behavior change), so now I need a definite ID from him, but I don‚Äôt know what to make him do. 
When there‚Äôs no scent for him to follow, he jumps on me. When he‚Äôs alerting on a door, he‚Äôll sit at the door. 
I thought of having his ID be to sit and give me a ‚Äòspeak‚Äô, but it‚Äôs not ‚Äònatural‚Äô for him, and he doesn‚Äôt know that command yet. Additionally, I‚Äôm afraid if I‚Äôm finding an autistic child, then Briggs will scare the child with his bark. 
So, any suggestions on other methods of ID‚Äôing someone, preferably something for ‚Äòshy‚Äô dogs?",Dovydude,2022-11-11,03:02:04,2022,11,11,3,2,Friday

Previously he has some separation anxiety, but now I feel like he is barking at every little thing and noise he hears when at home, and visiting family and friends.

0,DogAdvice,At heath's and wits' end with compulsive barking. I'm Miss something here and need help,"We adopted a bijon frisee ten years ago. We realized that he had a perpetual problem when he treated collars like shock collars. He was silent when we first got him but he had been returned multiple times so we figured there was a serious problem. Keep in mind that we are both physically handicapped and can't move quickly to correct him. Here's what we've done so far, all with supporting advice from trainers and vets:

-	Verbal correction
-	Thunder shirts
-	Water pistol
-	Keeping on lead by our sides for physical correction
-	Two different trainers, one in their own home. 
-	Daily exercise and/or dog park with our other dogs
-	Time out in kennel
-	Rewarding for silence
-	Ear hoodies
-	Vibration collar (responds pretty well to this but becomes inured to low pulse and we think it's cruel).
-	Clicker training for silence

He barks full voice. He barks at any sound inside or out of the house. I just picked up my coffee cup and he barked at the sound of my nails on the porcelain cup. If I sneeze, he barks, fart and he barks, stirring a pot of soup, talking to my spouse, dogs miles away, everything and all the time. 

I'm a diagnosed trauma tension ""sufferer"" who refuses anxiety meds because it's stupid that this dog's sharp bark results in anxiety. He just never stops. The neighbors are complaining, dog owners are complaining when he barks at their dogs' normal alerts, he barks the whole time we are gone from the house.

He's got to be miserable. His back is just tight muscles and no amount of anxiety supplements or herbs help. He's developed a heart murmur and he'll probably die of it, it's so serious. 

Horrible admission: I talked to spouse about letting him go when he starts seizures or passing out. I have developed a diagnosed heart problem myself because every time he barks unexpectedly I jump (has to do with the reason I have PTSD). But I just can't kill an anxious but healthy dog. 

We're all missing something. Diazepam works 20 minutes for him and I refuse the meds for me. 

Note: This post is extremely hard for me. Please try to be kind even if it's an obvious solution we haven't tried.",first52,2022-11-11,01:54:13,2022,11,11,1,54,Friday

I have a very smart Aussie/blue heeler mix pup (female; born Aug 2), but I‚Äôm struggling a bit with helping her learn how to interact with dogs. She just gets so excited there is no holding her back.She jumps up in front of other dogs, tried to jump on their faces, and doesn‚Äôt seem to understand when the other dog is displeased. My neighbor has a very old chihuahua (he‚Äôs very chill) but my puppy gets far too excited with him. I would really like to facilitate better boundaries so that they could interact more. 

We share a fenced yard. I‚Äôve tried holding her u til she calms down, letting them sniff while both are being held by separate people, and putting her in a leash. I‚Äôve been unsuccessful in getting her to remain calm around him. Even if I can get her seemingly calm laying next to me, she immediately loses it when he comes close.
He‚Äôs simply too old for her to be so aggressively playful, but we share a yard and besides, it is not a behavior I want to continue.

0,DogAdvice,My dog wont drink water!,So I've had my dog for a 3 years. I did rescue him when he was about a year. He listens to me and I think we have a good bond. Lately I've noticed that he doesn't drink enough water. It came to my attention when I saw the amount of water left since I typically change it a couple times a day. I know he is thirsty because I take him out for walks and even then he barely drinks any. But the moment someone comes visits me ( I have friends and family come over constantly) he runs to his bowl and drinks almost ALL of it. He has been doing  this constantly. As if he is afraid to drink when im around. I don't understand how this started happening but I don't want him to be afraid.

Please leave any advice.

0,DogAdvice,"Nail sanding- used to be okay with it, tonight was a nightmare.","My dog has black nails so I opted for an electric grinder over clippers. It used to be a breeze. He used to sit still the entire time when I first adopted him but with time it‚Äôs become a nightmare. First, he incessantly licks at the grinder when I‚Äôm doing his nails and one time he got too close. It was okay it just startled him a bit. When I have friends over or my partner they give him little treats while I do his nails and that usually works. Tonight I am by myself and needed to do his nails. I‚Äôve done it alone many times but I wanted it to be a pleasant experience  for him tonight so I offered him a little raw hide chew to work on while I did his nails so that he wouldn‚Äôt lick at the grinder. He ignored the chew and thrust the entire time to get away. I feel like the chew made things worse cause he was focused on having it but wanted it in the right setting (to be comfortable chewing on it) I finished his nails using his training treats to distract him instead and gave him the chew immediately after.

0,DogAdvice,Dog heath decision - what would you do?,"Cross-posted to r/vet but looking for some level-headed advice from other dog parents. 

7 year old lab mix with propensity to eat things she should not (but always passes them)

55lbs, spayed. Takes 16mg apoquel daily. 

On Sunday, she was in her kennel and must have gnawed off part of her fleece blanket. We noticed this in her stool the next day. While she hasn't eaten this before, she's taken a stab at a kennel cover, a back pack, a passport, and various other inedibles over the years without issue. 

She's eating, drinking, and behaving normally. We don't see any fleece after Monday night. Stomach is soft, she doesn't seem to have any pain.

This morning, I wake up to find her pooping in our bed. Normal stool (not diarrhea) but unusual. I think it might be an anxiety poop since her schedule is off and we have been packing for a cross country move. She has pooped inside because of anxiety before. 

I take her to a 24 hour vet out of an abundance of caution, and because I'm nervous about any issues during move. 

they take x-rays, but overall she looks fine according to the vet. Says her belly is soft. We get sent home with antibiotics and a probiotic for any digestive upset. 

This evening, they call and say they sent the x-rays to a radiologist who identified something in her stomach that ""likely"" is the blanket. They recommend surgery or at least observation in their ICU, fasting, and rescan tomorrow. I ask if we can just fast her overnight and bring her back, vet doesn't like that plan. I ask if we can get her scans from this morning and talk to our normal vet tomorrow for a second opinion. She says she doesn't know if they can send the scans and the radiologist was a second opinion. Idk if she was frustrated but she seemed to really dislike that I asked.

I'm at a loss here, I have whiplash from the ""yeah she's fine"" to ""no she needs surgery."" Am I making a massive mistake by waiting to see her normal vet tomorrow? She has separation anxiety and I feel like an overnight is also overkill when she is behaving like her happy, normal self.

The complicating factor  were supposed to leave for our move on Friday. It's a three day trip, and we will be pretty far from emergency care Saturday afternoon through Sunday afternoon when we arrive. I will push it back and pay for a hotel to stay with her if she needs surgery but I feel like I'm not getting a good picture of the situation when there was this massive switch.

She's pooped, ate, drank, and played all day. 

Edit to clarify, vet definitely said it was in her stomach not intestines. I wouldn't play around with her intestines.",Upbeat_Peak2854,2022-11-10,09:39:42,2022,11,10,9,39,Thursday

0,DogAdvice,aggressive dog just keeps getting worse,"So I've asked before on here pretty sure and I've emailed our local humane society for advice from their behaviorist, but I'm not having any luck. 


My sister has a small chiweenie  that was a rescue from a hoarder situation, she's 9 years old now, we've had her little over a year.  She was clearly abused given by all the scars on her face, she used to bark and run away from everything but now its escalated to barking and charging at stuff to bite it- atleast for me and my dogs. 

A few months ago when I first asked for advice it happened after she bit me for the first time. Had to get stitches but I blame myself because I could've handled the situation better. Long story short sister left the house, dog somehow got foot stuck in spiral notebook, tried to help dog and she was letting me until I got pliers then- chomped.  She was scared amd hurt so really dont blame her.

After that I tried really  hard to get her to like me like she's super food motivated so I give her treats and bought her lickimatts and treat toys to help her destress.  For awhile it did seem like she was really coming around to me, like she would come up to me at the gate wagging her tail expecting a treat and isn't as upset when my sister isn't home. 

But she's suddenly made a U-turn to being mean again. My sister let her out of her room and she charged at me barking tried to grab my leg but thankfully just grabbed my pants legs. She's tried that a couple times now and my sister ignores me and tells me it's no big deal.

Now when I come over to the doggy gate at my sisters door she runs up to the gate barking, snarling, and trying to get at me through the gate. Literally yesterday I put a basket of clothing  by the gate and she grabbed a sweater sleeve through the gate and started biting the hell out of it. 

I don't know what to do honestly,  I've done what I can safely and my sister doesn't seem to care or see a big deal about the behavior. I've told her that she needs to start walking the dog or burn off some of that energy to help with stress and don't use negative reinforcement bc she's already afraid(ie spray bottle and yelling) at bare minimum. Neither suggestions have been used. 


I make sure to keep her separate from my dogs per adviced by the behaviorist, I'm pretty sure she'd start a fight with my dogs and that would likely end poorly since my dogs are 75 lbs and 50 lbs. 

Honestly I'm stumped at what to do at this point. The way things are going I'm defiantly going to get bit again and I'd feel really guilty because if that happens the next step will likely be euthanasia.",Stabbingi,2022-11-10,08:48:51,2022,11,10,8,48,Thursday

0,DogAdvice,Plush toy aggression,My male German Shepherd turned 2 this week so we bought him any toy he picked out at the store. He previously showed some protective behavior towards stuffed toys so we stayed away from them and pretty much stick to rubber toys. We've had him for a year now and he's completed his training classes but still showed some protective behavior toward stuffed plush toys (but none towards his bones and rubber toys or even food). Of course he picked a plush duck toy and still showed some protective behavior over it (growling and snipping that otherwise we never see). Well the toy lasted all of 2 days but I'm wondering if we should continue to avoid plush toys or if it would be beneficial to keep buying them to hopefully wean out the protective behavior with treat exchanges or something.

0,DogAdvice,Should I rehome my cat?,"I need advice!

I have an 8 year old Rat Terrier mix. She‚Äôs got a lot of health problems and her vet bills are getting really expensive. She‚Äôs got heart disease and can‚Äôt be under stress. 

I have a one year old Tortie cat named Clover. I‚Äôve had her a little over a year. She really stresses my dog out. She‚Äôll go and hit my dog all the time. There are times where she‚Äôs got Sadie‚Äôs eye and made her squint. (She‚Äôs not declawed). Sometimes when Sadie is laying down or something, Cloverr will come and start hitting Sadie and Sadie gets mad and starts going after her and I‚Äôm afraid that Sadie might hurt her because she‚Äôs constantly bothering my dog and my dog is getting really stressed. Like I mentioned above, my dog‚Äôs vet bills are getting expensive. I‚Äôm 3k in debt. I don‚Äôt know if I can even afford clovers vet bills. I‚Äôve had my dog when I was going through drug addiction and she saved my life. So my dog will not go. However, I was wondering if it‚Äôs better for both of them if I rehome Clover to someone who can afford her and give her more attention and maybe she‚Äôll even have some cat friends in a new home. 

What would you do? I‚Äôm so lost. I love Clover but I have to do what‚Äôs best for my dog and Clover both.",caninexx,2022-11-10,06:24:33,2022,11,10,6,24,Thursday

0,DogAdvice,Correcting Aggressive Behavior,"So I adore my dog. He's an ""American"" Corgi. I knew he was a corgi mix when I got him. But I didn't really know about the fashion breed until after. I have a full Pembroke. Anyway, I got him when he was about nine months old. So he wasn't a puppy. The story is that he was the last of a litter. No one wanted him because he wasn't real heavy with the red merle that they wanted. And he didn't get the blue eyes. So he was kind of cast aside. The breeder ended up moving and couldn't sell him so her mom took him. And she breeds American Bulldogs. My little guy was kept mostly in a kennel that was heated and cooled, according to the seller. She said he got plenty of time hanging out with the other dogs. But I have no clue what happened as far as training goes. She said he was in the process of potty training.

I've had him now for three years. I finished his training. So he does awesome on leashes. He's potty trained. Does really well with other dogs. And cats. Like amazing with cats. Good dog. Super smart. Learned really fast. BUT during the first year I noticed some odd behavior. One, he was scared of males at first. To the point when my boyfriend would pet him, he'd pee. Second, showing any kind of discipline would also make him pee. He'd flinch if he thought he was in trouble. He'd pee if we raised our voice. So of course I'm assuming he was abused.

A lot of the behavior we've corrected with patience and consistency. He started getting food aggressive but we've corrected that. He's still really bad about getting into the trash. But here's the thing... so let me first say he trained *himself* to go into the kennel. Like... he realized when we leave, we put him in the kennel. So when we put our shoes on, that's where he goes. I'm again assuming this is a save haven for him. So any time he thinks he's in trouble, he also puts himself in the kennel. It got to the point where now we don't really know how to punish him. Because now he growls at us when he gets in trouble. 

His body language is more like he's scared. We've NEVER hit him. We do not believe in physically correcting our dogs. Just... no. But he definitely backs himself into the kennel and growls when we get onto him. He's bitten me once. He got a pork chop the cat had knocked down. And I reached for it thinking I could grab it. Big mistake on my part. I didn't say anything, I just moved really fast and he snapped at me. I should have known because at that point I was aware of how scared he gets. Because usually, I'll tell him drop it and I can grab what he's got. 

He's not protective of the kennel. I can reach in there just fine. I can reach in there when he's in there. I try not to reach around him when he's eating. I feel like he gets really uptight when he eats. I can move the bowl slowly, though. So I don't know if the food aggression is linked to the kennel thing. I don't know if the abuse is just that deeply rooted. My boyfriend and I have been playing around with different ideas. Like putting a blanket of the kennel when he's in trouble? Or leaving the kennel shut until we need to let him in there. I don't know. 

What I do know is that if something works, he'll pick it up. He's seriously the smartest thing. I just don't understand why he still gets scared and why he flinches. He's been with us for three years, now, and we've never hit him. I don't know why he's so scared. I'm really looking for ways to kind of correct this behavior so he can know better when he's in trouble. It's like he thinks because he's punishing himself, he can get away with it.",ProfessionalNinja298,2022-11-10,04:33:20,2022,11,10,4,33,Thursday

0,DogAdvice,Should I Take My Dog Back From My Mom?,"I have a 9 year old mutt, Blu (medium sized, \~30lbs, I was told he is part basset, part blue heeler) that I got when I was a teenager and still living with my mom.  When I moved out of my mom's house, I didn't take him with me because my mom's house had a large yard and I was moving into an apartment, so I didn't think it would be fair to him.  Almost 2 years ago, my mom's house burned down, and my husband and I had recently gotten an apartment with a yard so I took him in.  When my mom's house was rebuilt, the fenced off yard was significantly smaller.  My mom already has 2 dogs, and she is not the best dog owner.  She doesn't train them or even correct their bad behavior, and she rarely lets them out of her room.  2 months ago, I had to ask my mom to watch Blu for a couple weeks while we were living with a friend and waiting to move in to a house.  The yard at our house is large and would be perfect for Blu, but there are neighborhood deer that frequently come around, and Blu has a past of chasing wildlife (chickens, guineas, and peacocks that are no longer around at my mom's).  The yard is fenced in, but I wouldn't put it past him to jump right over it if he wanted to.  I haven't brought him to our house yet, because I'm worried he'll chase the deer, but leaving him with my mom with so little space makes me feel immense guilt.  He is getting older, and I want him to spend his last years with as much room to play as we can give him, but I'm so worried about what would happen if he attacked a deer.  This has caused a few small arguments between my husband and I because he thinks its a bad idea to bring Blu around the deer, and while I agree it could be a problem, I feel like I'm abandoning my dog.  

Any advice on what to do in this situation would be appreciated.

0,DogAdvice,80yr old Nan got an 8wk old puppy,"I live with my Nan and we don't have the greatest relationship but we try and make things work.

Nan has wanted a dog for a long time (there is already a Shepherd in the house), and I have seen this as a good idea as long as it was a good size and age. For a long time there were disagreements about the dog, as I've been unsure how the Shepherd will go with another dog. As well as the fact Nan wanted large dogs which would be hard for her to walk. 

So anyway, Nan has impulsively bought an 8 week old poodle cross dog. A toy breed. (At least it's small!)

Nan barely gets out of bed, clearly suffers from depression (has treatment for this), she seems to be having frequent falls and hides this from family - Her idea is leaving the puppy in the crate for long periods of time, as well as cuddles and feeds. 

But I am stuck looking after puppy majority of the time, Nan is upset and angry that I am interfering yet she isn't meeting the puppies needs. The pup is very energetic and Nan is hardly up for most of the day. Hardly asks to see or spend time with pup. If I want her to see or look after puppy because I'm going somewhere, she just tells me ""put him in the crate"".

I want to be able to support my Nan with this as it seems I am stuck in this position- However, Nan is reluctant and downright passive-aggressive over my 'interfering' &amp; refuses to speak with me realistically regarding the dog.

I have 2 kids in the home, I work, I have studies. This isn't convenient for me but I can't leave the puppy all day unsupervised and spending too long in a crate maybe 3+ hours easily. Which is why I've 'interfered'.

He‚Äôs had diahrea starting the day after we got home on Sunday, and still has it today (Wednesday) it‚Äôs a green ish kind of colour too. I called the vets yesterday and they said to try him on rice and boiled chicken and if it doesn‚Äôt go in 2 days to call them. They also said to give him so pro kolin and he‚Äôs only had one dose yesterday since there was only a bit left, but are picking more up for him this afternoon. 

Other than the diahrea, he has been acting his normal energetic and hungry self.

0,DogAdvice,Start of behavioural changes or a bad day?,"My ex and I adopted a pup (Springer Spaniel) who is now two. When we split we decided that because our dog always seemed to love me more I‚Äôd keep him. 

My ex moved out a few weeks ago but has been in &amp; out on weekends to spend time with the dog. Pup is very happy to see him and sad each time he leaves. 

He went to daycare today and seemed fine as we drove to/from. Right as we were nearly home I had to stop suddenly and he slid forward in his seat slightly (he does have a seatbelt restraint and it was on - he didn‚Äôt slide enough to have got hurt at all, just an inch or two with plenty of slack left) and he immediately tried to climb in my lap for reassurance/attention.

0,DogAdvice,I need advice on what we should do about my dogs tumor,"He's a pitbull mix,  over 12 years old.

This is a tumor that has been removed once before, after paying $1500 to the vet :(. It came back and it's leaking fluids, and smells quite bad. We've started putting a cone on him because he keeps licking it. I also have been applying a antibiotic ointment. The obvious answer would be to take him to the vet, but money is super tight right now, both mine and my partners cars decided to take a shit during the same week, as well as other issues coming up through out the year sucking away our savings. It's been a stream of bad luck.

I've had this dog since I was 18 years old and I'm 30 now so he's been a big part of my life and has even been the light during my darkest of places. If I could go back I probably wouldn't have adopted him because pets are sooo expensive. Hindsight is always 20/20 though. I feel like I'm letting him down and I just want his last year's to be as comfortable as possible. He still plays, loves peanut butter, and denta chews and no one believes he's actually 12 years old because of how active he is. He still acts like a puppy sometimes.

Once we catched up on his pet insurance payments we planned on taking him to get a check up, but we know they are just going to tell us he needs surgery. Another $1500. 

I'm doing what I can for him with what I have on hand. I worry about it getting worse and not being able to afford a ER visit for him, its so stressful. I love this dog with all my heart and I've given him the best life I could.",Godivore,2022-11-09,10:36:33,2022,11,9,10,36,Wednesday
0,DogAdvice,"we adopted a bonded pair, one has behavior issues","We adopted a bonded pair, one has behavior issues

I'm deciding to post here because I can't find a lot of information online for our particular situation.

My boyfriend and I just bought our first house and he brought his 10 year old American Eskimo dog Jack. I've always wanted a dog and I advocate for adoption from shelters. I've always said I'd get the oldest dog at the pound. Well at the shelter, the longest resident(s) were two, a bonded pair. So that's what we got, now we have 3 dogs. The pair are almost 4 years old, siblings, shepherd/boxer mixed with some other breeds. Brother and sister, named them Dipper and Mabel.

Mabel is very shy and timid, and the shelter workers called Dipper her protector. Dipper is much more outgoing.

Well, Mabel has clamped onto Jack's head 3 times within the past month that we've all lived here. The first time, I was giving Jack a treat in front of the pair and I think she got jealous idk. This was the bite that lasted the longest (7 seconds or so). 

Please note she always bites his head and never breaks skin.

The second bite was when there was a visiting dog in the neighbors yard and our 3 dogs got excited. Maybe Dipper and Mabel, or just Mabel was scared. Jack was barking at the neighbor dog and then Mabel clamped onto his head and shook him. 

The third time was just now, when we were all in the bedroom, on the bed except for Jack. All of us were playing together and having fun, but Jack was just on the floor watching. After we (thought) we all calmed down, my boyfriend went to bring Jack up onto the bed with us (he isn't usually on the bed because it's too high a jump) Mabel went to bite him again, we think she missed because we reacted so quickly. But Jack still yelped for being scared, maybe she got his fur, or maybe she did bite him. Either way, this bite lasted the least amount of time.

After doing some research I think they have littermate syndrome and Mabel got the short end of the stick. 

Looking for training advice or behavioral insights, obviously it's too late to prevent littermate syndrome. 

They are bonded and stop eating when they are separated, so getting rid of one of them is out of the question.

Also worth noting, after my boyfriend got Mabel off Jack the first time, I went to pick up Jack and then Dipper bit me on the back and tugged on me, not breaking skin but still left a big bruise. This was within the first week of adoption and honestly not worried about Dipper's aggression as it was only one instance provoked by Mabel getting yelled at and pried off, and he just wanted to do something to help her. If someone thinks this is something to worry about, please let me know but I'm more focused on Mabel's aggression.

We think the 2nd two instances were her trying to play with Jack but really not sure. Jack does not want to play.",mlance025,2022-11-09,09:53:37,2022,11,9,9,53,Wednesday

0,DogAdvice,Boarding Advice for those who need it,"I‚Äôve been working at a all in one pet facility for sometime now and have noticed a lot of erratic and stressed out dogs that come here and that‚Äôs no fault to our own it‚Äôs just how it is based on our specific focus noted on our site and founding history. I just don‚Äôt think people know that there are so many other variations of boarding that could cater to your dogs specific needs. My specific facility focuses more on hygiene and cleanliness as opposed to interacting and getting to know some of these dogs, which means that the dogs are supervised but we rarely touch or interact with them. Let alone do they get to socialize with each other. This doesn‚Äôt sound like a big deal to most but certain dogs need that stimulation and interaction. Our dogs just stay in cells all day separated from each other . And for puppies, Honestly if you have the money for it I‚Äôd highly suggest doing board and trains as opposed to just boarding a dog anywhere. I used to think my dog would be loved on and cared for by any reputable hosting company but that‚Äôs not true. I‚Äôve also visited some other facilities and noticed that these animals are also just put into isolated cells for long periods of time . (outside of a couple potty breaks) ..I didn‚Äôt know the difference when I first got my puppy and wanted to share and found that thumbtack actually offers some reputable professionals for affordable prices.  Even rover is nice!!Putting dogs especially puppies into confined spaces for long periods of time like ours is just a recipe for disaster and doesn‚Äôt teach them anything.

0,DogAdvice,Dog won't let us touch our feet.,"Hi, this is my first post on reddit so if I mess up the protocol it's just ignorance, sorry.

We have an approximately 2 year old mixed breed rescue dog. I suspect she has Pitbull, whippet and possibly Blue Heeler in her make up. Could be from a litter of hunting dogs.

She is a real handful and we have had a hard time getting her into a good place but the effort is paying off. Her obedience swings between Crufts level amazing and f... you depending on her focus. She exhibits possessiveness, dominance, stubborness, high prey drive / movement fixation and jealousy but not to an aggressive degree, we are slowly making headway stopping her jumping up on people and getting rid of a few irritating behaviors. 

I've had a few dogs and have a reasonable understanding of training and dog behavior but this wee bugger is the hardest dog I have ever had to train. Very smart, very stubborn.

This post is a cry for help to stop her trying to bite our feet when we walk and also to find out why she will growl and guard our feet if we or someone else touches them. She will display this behavior if we ask a stranger to touch their own feet... It's got me flummoxed.

I can only think that she may be possessive of them because they are at ground level, it's really weird behavior.

The days of tickling my girlfriends feet when she is on the couch are fading, the mutt will growl mildly and block any effort to touch them. I can stop her growling but she will not move away. 

Thoughts from the wise would much appreciated. Cheers.",WhaiWhaiPihau,2022-11-09,07:40:38,2022,11,9,7,40,Wednesday

0,DogAdvice,Food Obsession - Training Tips?,"Hello!

My partner and I are adopting a dog through a rescue program that rehomes stray dogs. So far, all things considered, he has been very well behaved - gentle spirit, no accidents in the house, learning basic commands quickly, fine with crates, and good around cats, children, and other dogs. 

We understand that as he adapts to his new environment, these things may change, but the one behavior we want to especially address is his obsession with food. Naturally, being a former stray, he‚Äôs not used to receiving meals regularly. His excitement over food has grown, to the point where he is beginning to jump onto furniture in the hopes of reaching more food, especially the cat‚Äôs.

When eating, he is ok with people petting him and moving his bowl, and growls a little when bones are taken away. No biting or aggressive behavior, but we also want to make sure he doesn‚Äôt develop that either in his obsession.

Some suggestions from trainers we have been given include investing in pet-safety cupboard locks and rewarding him with food/treats when his energy has simmered down and he‚Äôs no longer hyper focused on getting food. Curious what people‚Äôs success stories are and what other tips you may have?

Thank you!",whycantmynamebeghost,2022-11-09,06:23:28,2022,11,9,6,23,Wednesday
0,DogAdvice,Breeder says to feed 8 wk old twice a day? And is she really 8 weeks old?,"When I adopted my golden retriever, she was a few days shy of 8 weeks old. I got her from a breeder that breeds for hunting and they seemed to check all the ""ethical breeder"" boxes. 


However, the last time I adopted a puppy- it was from a backyard breeder (before I knew better) and she had no medical records, I didn't know how old she was supposed to be and we just fed her what the bag told us to before ultimately free feeding. 




So, I don't really know exactly what's right here. The hunting breeder instructed us to feed the pup only *twice* a day and .25 to .5 cup of dog food each time. She said we could use the kibble for training treats as well. I thought this was odd, since she's a bigger breed and I figured puppies eat more frequently.. she explained that they don't want their dogs ""growing too fast"" because of their growth plates which made sense to someone who knows very little about this stuff. 


Here's my concerns:

1. She is much smaller than I expected. I googled what they were suppose to look like and she seems younger. Her records say ""5lbs"" and I know her mother is a bit on the smaller side. 5lbs is supposedly the minimum weight for this age... but her face looks so much younger..like still that squished up newborn look? 


2. She is *so* hungry. I will feed her 1/3 cup at 8AM, maybe a little less for training treats, then 1/3 at 5PM.  Today, it sounded like her tummy was grumbling and she puked in her mouth a little.  Which sounds like hungry pukes (my bichon got like this when she refused to eat certain foods). 


I know some dogs are just highly good motivated and always ""hungry"", that they'll engorge themselves until they're sick. I also read that a sign of over feeding is diarrhea, which she had a couple of times when I gave her a little more food but I just brought her home on Friday so I can tell if it's just stress shits..

The first night she slept well, shit well, ate well. She just seemed to feel at home and is already pretty comfortable. 


Should I be feeding her at this frequency? I'm feeding her the same dog food the breeder used.

Linked is some pics of her so maybe you can tell me if she seems big enough to be 2 months old..Google can be deceitful sometimes. 

Excuse my nasty car.

0,DogAdvice,my 8 month old Samoyed is scratching my walls.,"Hi all, I have never posted on here before so bear with me. 

My beautiful 8 month old Samoyed Nimbus is scratching at my walls and I'm at a loss of what to do. 

Info- 
- it's not one dedicated spot it's multiple
- he gets multiple walks a day as we are in an apartment so lots of trips outside to do his business as well as 1 to 2 30minute walks. 
-he has plenty of toys and bones to chew on. 
-He has access to me all day as I work from home and he doesn't scratch at all if he's home alone. 
- he has one napped for 5 minutes then proceeded to stand up and scratch the wall then go back to sleep.
-I have contacted his breeder and even she is at a loss. 


I have days where he is an absolute angel and sleeps while I work from home and we play etc on my breaks, then there's days that from the get go he is scratching at the walls.

We now need to repair a few spots from him.


Please any advice will help

0,DogAdvice,Does anyone know how to find a farm for a dog to be re-homed at? We‚Äôre giving up our Australian Cattle Dog and I feel like the worst person in the world. But I want him to be happy.,"My husband and I moved
into a house two months ago.
I had wanted a dog for a long
time and even have
experience with other
herding dog breeds. We were
desperate. So we got a dog
from the shelter. They're one
of those horrible shelters that don't even allow you to meet
the dog unless you're going
to adopt it, and trap you into
taking a dog home without
making an informed decision.
Zeus is an Australian cattle
dog. Like I said, I've had
herding dogs before so l
thought I could handle it. But
I've never had a cattle dog.
Some stuff came up and now
my husband and I have to
work so much that no one
would be here with Zeus throughout the day. He has a
big yard to run in but all we
can offer him with our
schedules and sanity is a
brief walk at the end of the
day. He is horribly behaved
and is incapable of being
anywhere but inside his
kennel or outside. Otherwise
it is chaos. He is destructive
and hurts people- you can't
even sit on the couch without
him getting on top of you and
biting/nipping your face. He does not respond to no. He does not let go when he
grabs things. He barks. He
has harmed our child nephew and tried to bite our
baby nephew. He can be
aggressive. He is a lost.
Freaking. Cause. We've tried
everything and at this point
with our schedules there is
no way on the planet we will
be able to keep trying. I do
think he loves us. He has
gotten attached. And though
we have gotten attached, I
will admit I am scared of him.
There is no possible way we
can give him a happy life.
Either way it will hurt him, no dog in the world should have
to go through this. We effed
up. I hate myself so much
right now, and it will be my
fault if this is a continuous
cycle throughout his life. My
husband is sad and I can't even look at my dog without feeling a horrible sense of guilt. I can‚Äôt help but hate myself and take all the blame because I'm the one who initially wanted the dog. That is why I want to give him the happiest life possible. Is there a way to re-home a dog to a farm?",oh_n0_br0ken_table,2022-11-09,01:25:51,2022,11,9,1,25,Wednesday

I tried lick Mats, and these electronic smart toys that are supposed to be stimulating and toys and I tried taking everything and only giving her one at a time.

0,DogAdvice,Re-training leash walking for 2 year old dog?,"Hey all -

Was watching some videos about leash walking and it made me wonder if I messed things up at the beginning of working with my puppy (he's almost 2 now) and I'm curious if I'd have luck in trying to ""re-train"" leash walking.

To preface - he doesn't pull on the leash at all but he stops and smells every. single. tree/hydrant/fence. and that gets really old, really fast.  He never pulled on the leash when he was a puppy so I never felt the need to work strongly on leash walking skills and I had read how much it wears puppies out mentally to sniff everything so I generally let him do it.  He wasn't leash reactive in the slightest, wasn't pulling like crazy, and he got to sniff and wear himself out.  Win/win/win...or so I thought.

I'm curious though if that taught him that walks are for ""sniffs"" and not actually getting anywhere. (I know he doesn't care about that but I do.) He doesn't pay much attention to me while walking and I have to pull him along every few feet to get off a scent.  I've started on a ""walk"" command (just what I call it) to have him move off a scent and carry on with our walk but that lasts for about 20 seconds before he's right back to sniffing.

I have all the time in the world to train so I'm not afraid of getting my hands dirty and knowing this might take a while but I'm a little lost.  I think what sparked it was the leash training videos I was watching showed the dog paying close attention to the handler and that couldn't be further from the truth with my guy.  He's so engrossed in every single smell that he drowns out any commands and shows stubbornness.

Thanks for any help or advice.  

tl;dr Wondering if re-training my almost 2 year old dog on how to leash walk is possible because right now he views walking on leash as a sniffing adventure meant to cover 10 feet instead of the few miles I want to walk him.

We took her to emergency vet they got her a steroid injection and benadryl. Next day she has an accident in the house while I slept/gf at work. Swelling was gone by Tuesday so we stopped giving her benadryl/pepcid ac that the vet recommended but kept her on the proviable dc for her digestion she had solid good color poop all seemed to be getting better. Well Wednesday morning I woke up to an even worse case of diarrhea with some blood. (Note that to give her proviable we used some blue Buffalo wet dog food) when this happened I stopped using it and gave her plain chicken and white rice and waited 24 hours to see if she improved. Well she hasnt had an accident in the house but has had diarrhea, it started off orange but 2 days later was light brown and very slimy. It's been that way since,  yesterday she had to poop 5 times throughout the day with last one I took her out for being 2:30 am. Gf got home took her out at ~ 6 am we went to do some errands for an hour came back and she was clingy like she had to poop again. Gf took her out and she did poop a small amount but moved locations then let out a couple drops of blood. She has a vet appointment next Monday but I'm just worried at what could be wrong.

0,DogAdvice,Seeking Breed Suggestions/ Advice,"Hello!! I am not 100% sure if this is the right community for this post but am really seeking some advice from those with dog experiences. 

 My boyfriend and I have been wanting to get a dog for the past two years and are becoming much more serious on the plans of getting a pup as we are moving together this summer. We are planning to move into an apartment in Arizona. My boyfriend has experience with dogs (he grew up with a Britney spaniel), whereas I have never had a dog of my own, but my current room mate who i have lived with for two years as a dog (dutch shepherd) who i adore and help care for regularly. Basically as much I know I love dogs, I am a bit nervous as we have been talking about what breeds to look at since I have little experience. 

My boyfriend and I have compromised on no large breeds, since we will be in an apartment. We are both in our early 20‚Äôs, so looking for beginner friendly breeds. 
He personally loves spaniels and dobermans. I personally like king charles but I am terrified of their health concerns so have been put off the idea after further research; but i also love shepherds. We both do not want to look into any shitzus, poodles, or chihuahuas. Is there any suggestions of medium-small size breeds that are good in apartment living that anyone may suggest with all this in mind?",alxsli,2022-11-08,15:26:44,2022,11,8,15,26,Tuesday

0,DogAdvice,5 month old dachshund has a sudden fixation for shadows,"Our not-fixed female dachshund has all of the sudden found a fixation with shadows.  She‚Äôs very high energy, and one night, out of nowhere, while I was shining a laser pointer for her to chase, she became obsessed with shadows.  They‚Äôre primarily moving shadows, nothing static, but it really came out of nowhere.  Since she was a little-er guy, she would yell at shadows maybe once a week while taking her out at night.  She was more afraid of the shadows previously, but is now extremely excited by them, wagging her tail profusely the entire time.  

She also licks walls in what seems to be an attempt to get at the shadows.  I‚Äôm not an expert with animals at all, but she seems to be producing an insane amount of saliva during this process: she was trying to drag away a pillow that was under my head for less than a minute and left two very large wet spots on the pillow.  There weren‚Äôt any water bottles, pipe leaks, or anything else that would‚Äôve caused the spots

0,DogAdvice,Dog still itching after apoquel and cytopoint (years later),"Hi all, I have a 6yr old mini dachshund and she has been on apoquel (daily) for around 4yrs due to itching her skin until the point she would lose her hair around her underarms and ears.

It worked fairly well, however during this year she scratched her eye so bad she pulled out her third eyelid (looked like cherry eye). I used to be able to massage it back in as per the vets instructions, however one time it popped out and was too inflamed to be popped back in. She had to have it operated on with two row of stitches. 

In recent weeks, her itching has gotten so bad again and I‚Äôm terrified of her hurting her eye badly again. I brought her to the vet again today as I can‚Äôt take my eyes off her and instead she‚Äôs walking about with one of them blow up donuts on her so she can‚Äôt attach her face and eyes. 

The vet gave her a shot of cytopoint to see if things would ease up. It‚Äôs been around 12hrs and she‚Äôs still dragging her face along the ground. 

I ensured to have the vet check her eyes and teeth in case there was anything bothering her physically but it was all good. 

I just want her to be comfortable.. 

Any ideas? The vet told us she could be allergic to grass, dust mites etc and made sure we rinse her dry kibble. Just feeling really deflated and would love her to stop attacking herself!",luckycharms_889,2022-11-08,05:03:52,2022,11,8,5,3,Tuesday

0,DogAdvice,Suggestions for buying a muzzle (please read explanation!),"The actual questions are at the bottom. The rest of this is just me explaining why I think my dog might need a muzzle for walks. This is very long, sorry! 

My dog, Charlie, is pretty reactionary. He loves visiting people, but he's skittish around other dogs. But, needs to get more energy out. Our backyard is fine, but he needs more. Luckily, we live in a very good neighborhood for walking! There's a lot of trees that give shade, the neighbors are typically dog friendly, and there's a park really close by! Two main problems, though: People don't leash their dogs and there's a colony of feral cats. 

There's a lot of factors that go into the first problem, and I can explain if needed, but I'd like to keep this concise. On top of that, dogs can easily break out of the fences, b/c this neighborhood is kind of old and the fences have fallen into disrepair.

Also, there's just a lot of feral cats in this neighborhood. My neighbor's backyard is very overgrown because he doesn't actually live in that house. The tall grass and overgrown bushes are the perfect place for cats to hunt for mice and other small prey. So, they're near our house a lot. Charlie has a prey drive. I absolutely do not want Charlie to catch a cat. But they kind of just roam the neighborhood, and it can be hard to avoid them. Charlie is about 70 to 75 lbs (32 kg to 34 kg) and can overpower me if he really wants to. He hasn't yet, but I know he can. 

Now, the obvious solutions to not being able to walk the neighborhood are dog parks and dog daycares. Charlie doesn't do well at the dog park. It stresses him out &amp; ppl don't always watch their dogs. We usually take the dogs to dog daycare, but it's getting really expensive and we can't afford it. We also have another dog that he can play with, but sometimes he can get stressed out when playing and he starts getting more aggressive. We know how to take care of this, as do the employees at the daycare, but not everyone does and we don't want to just entrust our dog to someone who may not be prepared. So, looking for a cheaper daycare isn't really an option. 

All of this said, I feel like a muzzle would be the easiest thing to do to protect him and others. I haven't talked to my family about this yet, because I'm afraid they'd be all ""muzzle bad!!"" and I want to have some information to give them about why muzzles are not always bad. 

I've done a little bit of research, but I have some questions: Metal/wire basket muzzles are recommended for biting dogs. My dog is not a determined biter. He nips at people who come towards him, but can be more harsh to dogs that come near him. Still not a full-on bite, more of a snap, but do I need a metal/wire muzzle anyway? Since he might chase the cats, should I get a metal muzzle no matter what? Biothane muzzles look a lot more comfortable and friendly, and are advertised to hold up against dogs that nip &amp; snap, but how ""big"" is a nip? Biothane muzzles are also more expensive. Are there any brands you guys would recommend? Preferably cheaper but I'll always take quality over price. As of right now, I'm leaning towards a biothane muzzle, but I want to know more from other dog owners. 

Here's a link to some pictures of him, if needed: https://imgur.com/a/M5nTJzX

0,DogAdvice,"7 mo poodle bathroom issues, sensitive to redirection","We rehomed a female miniature poodle at 4 months old. By the time we got her, we were already her 4th house - she was passed from family to family who couldn't properly care for her. We also have a spayed adult yorkie mix with whom she gets along great. Puppy is scheduled to be spayed in a couple of weeks.

Puppy has been having intermittent bathroom issues. My husband works from home every weekday, I am on a hybrid schedule. On the days that I'm not home, he was finding one or two mistakes on the carpet in the living room despite letting her out every 2 hours. To remedy this, we cut off her access to the rest of the house when we work. We each have our offices gated off in a way that allows our yorkie to hop the fence and do as she pleases while the puppy is stuck with one of us unless she asks to leave (at which point we take her outside to pee and give her a chance to get a drink). She was also having issues peeing the bed overnight. We started crating her (much to her dismay) and given our different sleep schedules, she was going about 7.5 hours in her crate without having to pee. We started letting her sleep in the bed with us again and she hasn't had any other issues peeing the bed overnight. We have left the crate set up at the foot of the bed in case we need to go back to using it.

However, today we had a really weird issue. I was cleaning up during my lunch and left the bedroom door open as I toted some laundry out.  I noticed her go trotting into our bedroom. We have a dog bed on top of the crate because the cats like to perch up there. She jumped up into the bed on the crate and started peeing. I hurried over there and picked her up, which caused her to pause, and I went out on the patio with her and kept telling her to ""go potty"" to which she correctly walked o
into the grass and finished. She had been let out an hour and half earlier

Keep in mind, I don't raise my voice at the dogs - the most they've ever gotten is a low pitched ""NO"" if they're trying to eat rabbit poop in the backyard. I didnt even say the word NO when I caught her peeing in the dog bed because I was afraid it might cause her to associate peeing in general as negative. However, this poor dog was clearly upset after coming back in the house even after receiving a treat for finishing her business correctly. She went so far as to go and sulk on the couch in the other room, which is what she does when we've finished something she doesn't enjoy, like getting a bath or cleaning her ears - she didn't even want to follow me back into my office but I managed to coax her in here where she is now curled up and taking a nap.

We've never had issues like this with our other dog, so we're trying to navigate this as properly as possible. I know she's only 7 months old, so I'm not overly concerned about the occasional mistake on a rug - we've come up with ways to circumvent that problem. I'm mainly concerned about her reactions to being redirected away from the things she's doing wrong. Not to anthropomorphize her, but it's like she's super sensitive and gets her feelings hurt if you try to redirect her incorrect behavior. Am I doing something wrong? I'm going to take her to the vet to check for a UTI just in case, but she isn't showing any signs of one besides the accidents.

Any help would be appreciated.",StarTunnel,2022-11-08,04:25:55,2022,11,8,4,25,Tuesday

0,DogAdvice,"About to become a first time dog, poodle owner. Have a few questions and I would appreciate any input","Hello, folks! Good day to all!

So as the title says I am ready at last to get my own standard poodle. My favorite breed of dogs. My sister has a small one but she is not a good source of information.

Just to get it out of the way - I know that owning a dog is costly and I work from home. I chose the standard breed as I am rather active for longer walks and prefer the bigger size dog.

Few questions.

I am looking for an 8 weeks old puppy and I know that first half the year we need to be together all the time. But will I be able to live him home alone at 8 months as I usually spend weekend riding my motorcycle?

We live in a two story apartment - is it ok if the puppy sleeps on the first floor from the beginning as the cabinet is the most comfy and warm room?

My workplace has pet insurance for funny money - like $ 10 a month. Does it worth it?

Do you have experience in leaving the dog in daycare for a few days. I googled and there a re plenty with $65 a day separate room.

We also have a parrot. He is mature smart and coward. Usually he is pretty quiet, but when he is worried - as he sees a new face he may scream a few times. And this is not a good experience. Will it be very detrimental for a pup?

How easy(or hard) is keep a male poodle without neutering him? Do I get him a doll or there is like a circle of owners that let their pets copulate?

Also, what is ""a must"" when I purchase a pup? Some of them are reputable breeders and want $ 3000 for a pup with a waiting list about a year. Others are twice less than that and available but is it OK if they are not AKC registered? Also, I am definitely not going to participate in shows or making money out of puppies.

Does any of you have an 8 week old black standard pup for rehoming by any chance",brooklynbodycount,2022-11-08,02:32:05,2022,11,8,2,32,Tuesday

0,DogAdvice,Destructive behavior in 11-month old - I think he's understimulated,"We have an 11-month old husky who has gotten increasingly destructive as he has gotten older. I am pretty sure it is due to boredom, and would like to give him more stimulation to help. Currently he gets a walk at night, but I'm considering adding one in the morning (I don't think one walk a day is enough anymore; when he was younger it was)

Something to note is our setup: both my husband and I work out of the house all day. We have another dog as well. They both have access to the dog door (fenced-in backyard) so they can come and go as they please while we're away. While this helps with not needing to take them out for bathroom breaks during the day, it also means that we can't give him puzzles or other interactive toys because the other dog will take them from him, and we can't separate them during the day because they both need access to the backyard

I think my best option is longer walks and also walking him in the morning, but I'm not sure if that will help, or how long a walk needs to be to really keep him interested and tired out. I was also thinking of giving him a puzzle in the morning before I leave for work? He is currently not crated, but we are also considering that as an option.

Would love any and all advice. Thank you!",tuberosalamb,2022-11-07,23:47:17,2022,11,7,23,47,Monday

0,DogAdvice,4 Month Old Puppy is Having Seperation Anxiety,"Hey.  


Three months ago we got a doberman pup, it's our second doberman after our previous one crossed the bridge to dog heaven due to old age, a year ago.

We try as much as possible to not leave him alone at home as we already know from experience these dogs are clingy to their owners and are prone to seperation anxiety.  
Sadly, things don't always work out, and from time to time he has to spend some alone time at home. Of course he always has access to food, water, toys and sometimes even a bone to keep him busy.   
The issue is, that when left alone he becomes a different dog, and I don't think I have to be a dog psychiatrist to determine it is seperation anxiety.   


He immideatly starts.. screaming? I don't think barking or whining with any adjective would describe what that is. He doesn't destroy anything, and most of the time he won't even pee or poop  on the floor. He just stands at the door, for an hour or more, barking and whining like crazy. I can hear it from a block away, it's non stop. I'm not sure he even breathes while at it.  
Luckily for us we live in a dog friendly country, else the neighbours would sue us already and honeslty I can't blame them. 

Then when I open the door it's like I have returned from overseas and he hasn't seen me in years, even though I wasn't out for more than 10 minutes. 10. minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

What can be done? Should I try a trainer\*? I haven't had this experience with any dog in my life and neither has anyone I know. I don't even care about the neighbours, seriously, f them. I just don't want him to feel that way. it breaks my heart. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*trainer - my country is infested with horrible ""dog trainers"" which get certified by a ""dog training school"" that just makes bucket loads of money by pooping out as many ""trainers"" as they can. So it's both expensive and time consuming to find a trainer, and i'm looking for things I can start doing now, I don't know when the next time he'll be left alone is going to be, but as I said, even 10 minutes is too much.",GeForze16,2022-11-07,21:43:25,2022,11,7,21,43,Monday
0,DogAdvice,"Attachment issues (trigger warning, death)","backstory: I have a Shiba Inu mix (lab, pit bull, shepherd) named Sabrina. 1.5 years old. Ever since she was a puppy she has been quiet not one to play or lick your face, really timid. Our groomer even was asking if she was abused before we got her because of how shy and jumpy she is. She has NEVER been hit. She is crate trained. We are moving across country (literally coast to coast) and are staying at my moms for the time being. Brother passed 1.5 weeks ago while we were here.

Her brother passed due to old age and she was always attached to him. She was less timid around him. Now she has scratched the wall up when my mom was home sleeping and everyone else was gone and is pooping and peeing in the house. When she is let out she will just scratch the door unless I walk her or stand outside with her which I have been doing. But if I even go to the bathroom with the door shut she will piddle or poop on the floor even after just going outside. She follows me everywhere. I have also been bringing her with me everywhere I go. When I do leave her for short periods she is in her cage but when I return she is inconsolably excited/relieved for 5+ minutes crying, panting, and whimpering. She is stuck to me like glue. She has also developed a dislike for other dogs, even nipped at my brothers dogs and his puppy and a dog at the dog park. She listens to commands almost immediately and knows the basics sit, stay, lie down, and paw. What can I do to help my grieving puppy? I know she must be exhausted from the move as well.

Hi, can someone please give me some advice. Bonfire night was on Saturday and my wee dog was really terrified from the noise and stuff. My dad took her for a walk yesterday and she was fine for about 20 mins and she was off the lead but then ran away from him, her recall is really good and she always stays beside you when she is off lead. I took her for a walk this morning on the lead and her tail was down, she was pulling on the lead like she wanted to run home and she kept shaking every time she stopped. I am really worried about her I am not sure to just see what happens in a few days or go to the vet.",Scottish2307,2022-11-07,20:34:10,2022,11,7,20,34,Monday
0,DogAdvice,Very reluctant eater,"Over the past week, my 6yo Cairn Terrier X has  been a very fussy eater. Her meal sits there until its almost her next mealtime and she reluctantly eats from my hand. Tonight she's just not interested in food even by hand. Her teeth are fine and she's drinking water. Her belly doesn't feel tender.

We've tried swapping to the dry and wet bland the vet gave us after tummy troubles (found KFC in the park!). Not interested. She's happy to have treats on walks and we gave her a raw chicken wing on Sunday which she ate with gusto. She has eaten a couple of zucchini scraps and a piece of steamed pumpkin tonight. I put her meal in the snuffle mat and Kong bowl but she's just not interested.

She's normally a fast eater and she gets grain free dry food after her hour long walk before and after work.  I work from home and give her some wet food in a kong during my lunch. 

Has anyone had this experience? I'm very worried and the earliest vet appointment I can get is Wednesday am.

0,DogAdvice,Introducing my dogs to my cat.,"I have 2 dogs and 1 cat. A blue heeler 2-3 yrs old(William, who‚Äôs initially owned by wife) ,a lab pit mix 2 yrs old(Johnathan, who we adopted together) and a Maine coon 9 yrs old (gizzy, who is mine). I was living with my mom when wife and I met. I moved in with wife. And with an obvious concern for my cat, mom was willing to take care of Giz while I embarked on the next chapter of my life. 

Giz has been w mom for 3 years now, and i miss Giz ): theres been weekends here and there where Giz would stay the weekend with us just to try to introduce the lot. William has always been skeptical about Giz but never had any real problems. Johnathan is my biggest problem. We‚Äôll put dogs in the cage when Giz comes over so she can get acclimated to the environment. But when john sees her, he‚Äôll just bark his brains out scaring giz into a retreat making it hard for her to want to explore ): The only XP Giz has with dogs is just the very infrequent few day intervals with extreme supervision. Same vice versa. 

We dont have a lot of money right now to afford obedience classes. What are some tips to help get them more comfortable with each other? Or is it just a lost cause?

Ive read allowing 10-15 mins of meet and greet with the lot a couple times a day but its hard to listen to skull shattering barking for 15 minutes. Should I get ear plugs and just allow the behavior?

0,DogAdvice,How to bond 2 yr old with 8wk old,"Dudes... I have no idea what I'm doing. My 2 yr old Bichon Frise has not been socialized and we just never thought we would get another dog. We are her entire world. But since I've been able to stay home and pull my head out my ass, I noticed that she actually might need a sibling. 


So I agreed with my husband's wish to get a golden retriever. We figured the energy level would be great match. 

We've googled and YouTube how to raise this new pup, wanting to avoid the mistakes made with our Bichon. But what we didn't consider, stupidly and ironically, was how to help them get along. 


1. We thought she was going to be bigger..and totally forgot what an infant pup with pirahana teeth was like

2. Although we were so ignorant and made many mistakes with Bichon, it was easier to just focus on her. Training a new pup and showering her with do much attention, with a dog that has been spoiled all her life is a challenge I just didn't anticipate. 


Our Bichon might pull on the leash and doesn't know any traditional commands but she is actually a very polite and sweet girl. 



We were warned by the breeder that this Golden pup was ""anti-social"" as compared to her more social butterfly sister. Breeder seemed nervous about our Bichon getting along with her but Golden came right to us, fell asleep in our arms, and seemed to be indifferent about Bichon.


This will be our 2nd night with the new babe. I know she's only an infant and has only been with us for 48 hours. But my Bichon seems to be going through a mix of emotions and I have little idea of how go help transition together.


Golden wants to cuddle with us, naturally. Bichon is keeping her distance because Golden has asked for space... So Bichon doesn't get to cuddle or be close with us. 

It seems like Bichon is mostly curious, sometimes tries to ""correct"" Golden with boops or light display of dominance and Golden will lie down/show belly. But for the most part she stares from a distances, takes the opportunity to sniff the baby when she is sleeping, and is *incredibly* tolerant when Golden nips her. 

I mean, she's latched onto her lip with them shark teeth and my a Bichon just stood still, she never reacts even when her tail is being bitten. This hasn't happened often, we try to keep them separate and make them respect space if they are rowdy. 


Invitation to play turns into annoyance or fear because it seems Bichon is unsure how to play with this baby.. and Golden nips or gets irritated with the darting around. 


It honestly makes me sad that it appears my Bichon is trying to figure out this new friend, wants to play but doesn't know how, and is also dealing with her home and family being taken over. 

I feel like an utter failure. I'm heart broken over how poorly my beloved 2 yr old has been socialized and seems to want a friend so badly. And I'm frustrated that I can watch all the videos on dog body language but it seems like it all goes through one ear and out the other, not to mention with all the different methods and opinions and advise that seems to conflict. 

I'm worried they may never get along, because these first few weeks/month are so important and that I'm fucking it up by either intervening with the way they figure things out or allowing bad habits. 


So far they eat well together, sometimes sleep near each other.. but mostly keep a distance. 

I will be crate training Golden as advised by the breeder. I'm hoping to also work on training my Bichon. 

Any advice about how to facilitate their relationship is much appreciated. I genuinely wanted a sibling for my Bichon, not to just get another dog. 

I'm also considering getting a trainer for them both? I don't know how young is too young for that but I feel like I need the help... 

Sorry about the emotional rambling. I'm barely alive with like 2 hours of sleep since yesterday and a hot mess.",MomentsOfSuffering,2022-11-07,12:04:51,2022,11,7,12,4,Monday
0,DogAdvice,"Dog scared of car while in motion, but is fine with the car as long as it's stopped.","OK so I've got a Pitbull-Terrier/German Sheppard Mix who's a little over one year old. We got her at 4 months old. I'm a truck driver, so she went on the road with me for about 4 months while I worked on training her, getting to know her, and bonding with her.

Originally we thought the fear was just because of a new environment, so we did as we were advised by vet and trainer, and gave it time, hoping she'd adjust. After 4 months of her ultimately shutting down while I drove and opening up, getting playful and happy when I parked, we realized it wasn't a ""new environment"", but instead a fear of a vehicle in motion. Stop lights, stop signs, parked, as long as it's not moving she is 100% open and happy. So sadly I pulled her off the truck and she's become my wife's dog. Except when the wife comes out with me once a year.

Just got done with the wife being out with me for 2 weeks and Snowball has acted a lot more comfortable this time due to the wife being on the truck. Vet has made a few suggestions about it maybe being motion sickness, so we tried motion sickness medications (no effect), tried a thunder wrap jacket which makes her feel like she's being hugged all the time which has helped quite a bit, but not solved the issue. We also set her crate up which is what she feels is her safe space, which is frankly where she spent most of her time while we were moving.

I was wondering if anyone else has had this issue and if there is anything we can do to make her more comfortable during the occasion ride? Obviously I'll never be able to bring her back on the truck full time, I wouldn't dream of it considering her obvious fear of riding, but it would be nice if she wasn't so scared when going to the vet, to the park, to the pet store, etc etc.

Recently read CBD might help. We know she deals with SEVERE separation anxiety (this was from before we got her, but being with me on the truck 24/7 probably didn't help that issue), but don't know if that's related to the fear of the vehicles moving.

If anyone has any suggestions it would be extremely helpful. Thank you!",Hellyrr,2022-11-07,11:51:37,2022,11,7,11,51,Monday

0,DogAdvice,Help: How to adapt my 4 y/o reactive male GSD to my new shepherd mix puppy,"Yesterday, I adopted a sheltie gsd mix from my cousin, who's roommate had puppies and needed to rehome them. They had their first few vaccines and a dewormer. This is relevant later in my post. Yesterday, when the puppy came home, he met my 4 y/o male GSD outside in our backyard. I recognize this may not be the best way to introduce them, but I do not have the possibility to introduce them another way. At first, he was just very curious of the puppy and was sniffing him a lot, and the puppy was laying on his back very submissively while my older dog examined him. Then, once the puppy started to move, my GSD tried to grab him and the puppy yelped. When this happened, my GSD went into what I call ""lock mode"" and he tried to go after my puppy. I picked him up and walked away, and my family members helped by taking my GSD inside and I put my puppy in the crate I set up for him. It is near our living room and dining room. My GSD was highly anxious, panting a lot and just standing outside of his crate. He would occasionally bark playfully at my puppy, but once or twice it was a firm and unhappy bark. My puppy seemed really scared, and once we took out my GSD I took out the puppy from his crate. He projectile diarrhea all over the living room, I'm guessing from stress or fear. Once he was cleaned and settled he was calm, but he started having bad diarrhea for the rest of the evening and today as well. I would take him in front by himself on a loose leash and he would poop, he is a very smart puppy and is already house trained in just one day. Today his diarrhea was basically water, and I called so many vets and animal hospitals, but none were open since its Sunday. I was fearing he maybe had Parvo or Giardia.  I took him to my dad's camper on his truck since it was a nice breezy day and we didn't want to risk my other dog getting sick. I set up his kennel in there and he seemed to like that environment much more. He ate rice, boiled chicken and carrots to soothe his stomach and he drank lots of water, and was so relaxed he even took a nice nap, which he hadn't been able to do since yesterday. He was very playful with me and was cuddly as well. I spoke to my cousin and he agreed to take him for the rest of the day to see if the better environment, or one that he was used to, would help his symptoms. Once we arrived at his house, he was very happy to see his dad and he immediately went to play with him, and then went to lay down on his belly on the kitchen tiles, very relaxed. Then he went into his kennel where I left him, and he was eating more of the mix I packed for him. Now I am wondering if the issue was my GSD, since he was so vigilant about him and would not let him rest. Every time he would move, my GSD would come running up to the crate and watched his every move. I am scared that maybe I am not the right home for him. I understand it takes hard work to raise a puppy and I am ready for that, but I also do not want to risk my GSD hurting my puppy intentionally or by accident. I also do not want the puppy to suffer from extreme stress and fear, when he could be in another calmer environment. He is such a sweet and gentle puppy that I want the best for him, but I have also grown so attached to him already and he has with me as well. I am very conflicted and don't know what to do. Puppy has a vet appointment tomorrow to rule out any viral or bacterial infections. I was thinking of hiring a trainer to help with their assimilation process, but I don't know if this should be done for both of them or just for my GSD.

0,DogAdvice,My dog tried to attack another dog,"English is not my first language so I apologise for the misspelling 

My dog (I‚Äôm going to call him T) is 3 y/o, he is kinda large (25 kilos), VERY strong and incredibly rough in the way he plays. He never hurt anyone, what I mean is: he doesn‚Äôt realise how big he is in comparison to others so he plays as if everyone is his size

What happened today: I was on my way to the park with T and my 11 y/o cousin and she wanted to walk him and take the leash. Out of nowhere, T starts pulling really hard bc he saw a another dog, but it was so rough that my cousin almost fell to the ground and he went straight to the other dog. It took me a solid 2 seconds to realise what was happening and grab him by the harness. 

Honestly, idk if T was trying to play, but thankfully the other dog took it like a champ. Understandably, the owner was livid and started yelling at me but I was so shocked that I don‚Äôt even know if I apologised. 

Like an idiot I still took him to the park (6 blocks away) and on the way he wanted to greet a random woman so I got furious and grabbed him by the harness, again, but this time all the way to the park.

When I got to the park I went to the place all the dogs are and T was playing like usual but when he got tired and was laying next to us. A puppy came and started being cute and giving us kisses. I thought it was weird that T didn‚Äôt react at all cause normally he just looks at me and jumps to get my attention, but I though nothing of it (again, stupid). After the fourth time the puppy came, he accidentally stepped on T‚Äôs ball and T went crazy, started growling and tried to stand up. I grabbed him so nothing happened but I got furious. When I was scolding him the puppy‚Äôs owners were apologising profusely and I was apologising to them, too.

We took him home and he behaved perfectly on our way back. I‚Äôm guessing because he could tell I was pissed.

This never happened before, I‚Äôm so angry and so worried. What if hurts a dog next time? I don‚Äôt know what to do, please I need advice",jochufita,2022-11-07,04:50:37,2022,11,7,4,50,Monday

I can't even describe the frustration this causes everyone but my dad refuses to train him properly or get professional help. It has even led to some people in the house crying and having mental breakdowns over how insane it drives them. In the past, I've tried to spend time with him. I've played with him, cuddled him, etc. But he doesn't care. Even when I'm next to him trying to give him attention, he will sit on the side of the sofa crying until dad's back.

0,DogAdvice,Dog on a low-fat diet?,"Hello!

A couple years back my dog had a parasite and due to this had a major lack of appetite. My vet at the time said he was probably having gastrointestinal issues and told me to switch to a lower fat kibble. Since then (it‚Äôs been years) I finally found the Hills Science diet weight management kibble that he does eat (although we pretty much have to now top it with other fatty options to get him to eat it). It‚Äôs a minimum 8% crude fat. I was told to look for MAX 8% in the past but the minimum is fine.

However, my dog isn‚Äôt getting fat, he isn‚Äôt gaining weight, he has normal poops and is a happy 5 year old. I would really like to switch him to a better, richer kibble that he deserves without crazy toppers like chicken or goat milk!

I‚Äôve been looking at grain-inclusive options between open farm, orijen or jignature. Although the lowest crude fat minimum is 15%.

Has anyone‚Äôs vet ever told them something similar? I fear that this is advice he once gave me based off assumption and the last thing I want is to harm my boys tummy? What do you think?

TLDR; dog was put on low fat diet at age of 3, has stayed on it due to vet recommendation, want to get him something better but crude fat is higher and want advice.",Beneficial_Party_677,2022-11-06,21:31:48,2022,11,6,21,31,Sunday

0,DogAdvice,First night with 8wk old: when do they sleep through? Sleeping with us vs crating,"When we got our 2 year old Bichon, we had no idea what we were doing and were afraid of noise violation when crate training so we just didn't crate train her. We like sleeping with her and so that's been our dynamic. 

However, we picked up an 8 week old Golden Retriever yesterday and we are wiser now, having learned from our mistakes with our first pup. We *do* plan to crate train her and more or less know how but there are different opinions about crating the first handful of nights at this age. Something about making them feel safe and building confidence. 

This is important to me and from her perspective, she's just been taken from mama and littermates. So  I'm posting at 4 AM, having had maybe 2 hours of sleep total, wondering when I can start fucking crating her lol

Some articles say I can expedite her sleeping through the night by crating. I'm just worried that she'll associate it with being isolated and scared. I want this crate training to go as smoothly as possible. Of course I'll train throughout the day too. 

Each time she's gotten rowdy or whined, I took her out of our bed to go potty and she's peed. She'll come back to bed, play a little, then sleep. So it's not to crazy. I'm just looking at... what? 8 more weeks of sleep deprivation? 

Is it normal for me to just lose sleep until she is fully potty trained and sleeping in her crate? I guess it wouldn't be the first time I went insomniac for several weeks lol. 

Am I wrong to let her sleep with us for a while? If it helps build security and confidence.. how soon do you think I should start trying to crate her at night? 


I'm sure this has been posted a billion times and mine is riddled with typos. I'm just fucking exhausted and worried I'm fucking this up again lol",MomentsOfSuffering,2022-11-06,19:29:48,2022,11,6,19,29,Sunday

0,DogAdvice,Advice on training(?) a Dr.Jekyll/Mr.Hyde dog,"A year ago, my family adopted a 5.5 y/o supposed Pomeranian/Lhasa Apso from the local shelter. We neutered him, got him groomed, and fixed his ear infection. We were told he had a bite history but it was implied it was one time &amp; was regarding touching his sensitive infected ears.

He is cured to my knowledge from the infection. He is VERY cuddly and loves attention. He‚Äôs overall a sweetheart! But sometimes he can have triggers that turns him into a ‚ÄúMr. Hyde‚Äù, and it does not appear to be a fear response. I‚Äôm talking when he doesn‚Äôt want to get off the couch, leave the car he hopped into unexpectedly, have his toy he suddenly decided to protect be approached, or be prevented from eating poop (cat, dog, doesn‚Äôt matter). 

A trainer we saw with him suggested a drag leash to be able to pull him away from his trigger which helped a lot towards protecting everyone involved. He immediately acts like nothing happened! However‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs banned from the groomers, at least for nail trimming I think, because he‚Äôs bitten the groomers too many times. One groomer was bitten during the cutting process &amp; she finished the next day, the next groomer was bitten while trimming the nails to the point she had to leave and seek care. 

I‚Äôve heard a veterinary behavioralist might be able to help? Haven‚Äôt gotten to look into too deeply, but I know it may be pricey. Just wondering if there is any other options to explore before splurging on a potential mystery box.

I thought it was just allergies since the skin looked [red](https://imgur.com/a/ZvRg4He) and now purplish. I noticed my male dogs constantly trying to sniff and lick her &amp; she‚Äôs spayed. 

I initially thought it was just allergies (I gave Zyrtec which didn‚Äôt seem to make a difference) but I‚Äôve noticed she‚Äôs possibly peeing more and drinking more water. There was 1 day where she just kept asking to go out (though she didn‚Äôt always pee) and it freaked me out so I toke her to the vet for a suspected uti. We did the urine culture test which would came back after a few days, x rays, and blood work which came back fine except bilirubin was high. Vet wasn‚Äôt concerned given the other values were normal. Vet also didn‚Äôt see bladder stones. 

We started antibiotics and few days later, the culture test turned out negative so she said it‚Äôs probably not a uti. Possible vaginitis but it‚Äôs hard to diagnose.

I didn‚Äôt mention it to the vet but my dog has a belly, I believe the vet saw it because she said she felt that area and it tender. It could also be from weight gain from her spay last year",Spizypickles,2022-11-06,11:10:54,2022,11,6,11,10,Sunday

0,DogAdvice,Dog will not eat joint supplement,"TL;DR: I have tried everything I can think of to get my dog to eat his prescribed joint supplement on a regular basis, but I cannot get him to do so short of shoving it down his throat. Putting it in his food is not a viable option for regular consumption. Need creative ideas to coax/trick him into eating it (it can be crushed into a powder). Peanut butter and cheese don‚Äôt work. :(

I need some very creative suggestions here. My 9 year old Bichon was prescribed a joint supplement to be on for the rest of his life, but I cannot for the life of me get him to regularly consume it. Our journey so far: day one, he ate it on its own after I cut it into small pieces fairly happily. Day two, he refused to do this so I wrapped the small pieces in some cheese and this worked for another 2-3 days. Then he began to somehow eat just the cheese around it (all while keeping it inside his mouth) and then spit out the joint supplement piece inside. Okay, fine. I started to crush it into a powder and put it in his breakfast since he gets wet food with each meal, and this worked fine for a bit until he decided to go on a few day fast (which is not atypical for him, so please disregard this fact. He is otherwise healthy and always eats normally within 3-4 days). New plan was to crush it into the powder and put it into peanut butter so he couldn‚Äôt physically eat any part of it without consuming the supplement. I implemented the plan this morning, and I kid you not, my dog who loves peanut butter did not touch it. I am at my wits end, and short of forcing him to eat it like a pill (which I REALLY don‚Äôt want to do), I am out of ideas. He must be able to smell the supplement in everything and he clearly doesn‚Äôt like the taste. I am willing to try literally anything as long as it isn‚Äôt aversive.",meganv21,2022-11-06,09:53:52,2022,11,6,9,53,Sunday

0,DogAdvice,Why might my dog keep limping and how can I help?,"Jack Russell Spaniel X. 9 years old. 10kg. Healthy weight. 

I‚Äôve taken him to the vets FOUR times in the last year over it. Almost always he stops limping before we get there. It‚Äôs costing me a fortune in pointless vet visits.

The most recent time the vet gave a really thorough manipulation, pulling his leg back, moving it around and pushing his fingers into the flanks and hips. Nothing. My dog was just looking at the vet as if to say WTF dude? 

It‚Äôs usually after a longer walk in the park, rather than just round the houses. Sometimes afterwards he can‚Äôt jump up on the bed, limps, is withdrawn and yelps really loudly if I try to pick him up. Seems to last longer and longer each time, but by the time we take him to the vet. Nothing. It‚Äôs really stressing me out. 

The vet says it isn‚Äôt arthritis, the hip hasn‚Äôt come out, nothing is broken and everything is where it should be. He‚Äôs been prescribed anti inflammatory medicine and that‚Äôs it. I feel like the vets isn‚Äôt really taking this seriously but I don‚Äôt know what to push for.",Heewna,2022-11-06,09:19:46,2022,11,6,9,19,Sunday

0,DogAdvice,Great Dane acting out/misbehaving?,"My dog Boston (8 y/o) has been acting out recently, and I can‚Äôt figure out why but I feel like I‚Äôm at my wits end. This has been happening slowly for the last maybe 3 months, but getting progressively worse the last month or so. 

She won‚Äôt go outside, and when she does she doesn‚Äôt go pee or poo, she just stands around. Then she‚Äôll come inside and do her business inside afterwards. Not as many pees inside but lots of poos. 

She won‚Äôt eat her food all day then down it right before bedtime so she usually has to go bathroom in the middle of the night. I‚Äôm worried if I put her food/water up at a certain time she‚Äôll go the whole day without eating? 

She hasn‚Äôt been listening to her usual commands at all (go outside, out of the kitchen, gentle, even just ‚Äúno‚Äù, etc.) and just ignoring us in general. She‚Äôs also been sniffing on top of tables/counters and even sniffing plates- all of the above she knows not to do and never did before. 

The two biggest changes that I think could be triggering all of this: back in June we had one of our other dogs put down, they were quite close. The other thing is that I‚Äôm currently 8 months pregnant, so maybe she can sense the change coming? 

She‚Äôs been to the vet and her health is in usual order (she has arthritis in her hips but that‚Äôs controlled with medication). She does have anxiety but usually just when she‚Äôs out of the house or around new people. 

Is it the death of the other dog finally getting to her? Is it the pregnancy? What can I do? Our other dog is acting completely normal and behaving well. I‚Äôm just worried about having a newborn while also trying to manage Boston‚Äôs new behavioural issues.",toebeansareforever,2022-11-06,07:44:08,2022,11,6,7,44,Sunday

0,DogAdvice,Dental cleaning for dogs,"We went to the vet this morning for just a wellness exam and to check up on his spine. He is doing fantastic and got a clean bill of health. 

She checked his teeth and they‚Äôre a grade 1/4 which is good for his age. We brush his teeth everyday. She mentioned dental cleaning. She said he doesn‚Äôt really need it, but he does have minimal tarter build up. Since we are brushing his teeth everyday, we have reduced gum disease and all that stuff. 

She told me that she thinks he would benefit from it but it‚Äôs not necessary at this stage. He is just healthy meaning there would be less complications right now versus later, if we do need dental cleaning. He is also 8 years old if this helps.

0,DogAdvice,Any advice on how to introduce a hyperactive dog to a grouchy cat?,"I want to preface this by saying I AM NOT willingly adopting a cat just because. This cat was my dad‚Äôs cat and he just passed away. No one else will take her and I do love this cat. It‚Äôs a piece of him that I want to keep. The only issue is I have a hyper dog. We think he is a border collie/catahoula mix so he is quite intense. He loves to stare down cats outside and would probably chase them if I let him. We fostered kittens once before and he was absolutely fascinated by them. He would sit by the closed door and sniff and would get so excited when the put their paws under the door. When I would hold the kittens, he would cry and want to sniff them. My dad‚Äôs cat is a grouch and has no fear. I‚Äôve seen her chase a 70 pound pitbull across the parking lot and throw herself at windows because a raccoon walked by. I have a spare bedroom that I plan on keeping her in for an extended period just to kind of depressurize. Is there any hope of my dog and cat coexisting? I know they will never be best buddies but I worry about the dog chasing her and then her whipping around and attacking him which obviously wouldn‚Äôt end well. How can I train him to leave her alone and let them get used to each other without stressing each other out? He is crate trained so I thought of putting him in his crate with a kong and letting her explore after a month or two of just being in the bedroom. I also don‚Äôt want her to be locked in a bedroom for the rest of her life because they don‚Äôt get along. I appreciate any helpful advice!

0,DogAdvice,"Dog jealous - how bad is this, and what to do?","My dog (female, almost 2 y/o) doesn't like it if I talk to or pet other dogs. If I do this, she'll usually jump up on me as if to remind me that *she's* my dog. She has a few times kind of ""pushed"" other dogs away/""slapped"" them if I interact with them, but today she did something she's never done before:

We were walking (she's on a lead), we ran into another dog that we see every now and then, on a lead with her owner as well, and as my dog loves all other dogs, she wanted to say hello, and so did the other dog. They went through the usual spiel of sniffing, playfully jumping around etc. when the other dog comes over to sniff me. My dog immediately (I hadn't even acknowledged the other dog yet) jumps up on the other dog's back and kind of grabs her - it looked like when a male dog tries to mount a female dog. I had never seen her do anything like it, and she did it twice on this encounter, both in the context of the other dog showing a very subtle interest in me.

Does anyone else have dogs that are like this? Is it likely to turn into aggression, and what can I do to turn this around?

Also, I interpret this is jealousy, but I'm not 100% sure if that's what it is, either.

0,DogAdvice,Amstaff bolting off and unresponsive,"Hey ya'll firstly I'm a new dog owner and have been learning a lot, but recently my dog bolted off and it was a frightening situation so I'm wondering how to go able handling it.

For some context, and yes this will make me seem very irresponsible but like I said I'm new to all of this and still learning the boundaries and relationship you have with dogs, so I did make a mistake and hopefully have been able to properly identify where I went wrong to learn.

So I got my Amstafg from a shelter July, 5 years old yet he's very sweet and affectionate, very obedient and responsive when at home. I've asked before here about leash training and will be working on that soon, but to re-explain here, he gets very excited and pulls hard on the leash. The shelter gave me a muzzle halti but it feels awful and he hates it so I've just got a harness and been slowly working with him, more just trying to get him out and get used to the area rather than training him.

Anyway, the otherday I left the front door open to take out trash, now he is such a good boy with 0 training he doesnt run away even as I left him at the open front door and went to the back of the house (please let me know if this is bad for whatever reason, I just trusted him) and he even came out and hung around me out the front, slowly beginning to walk off but once he left my ""orbit"" I said No and called him back, he would come sit next to me and I gave him some pets and praised him.

Now in hindsight I realise he was starting to get more and more excited the more he did it, only about 3 times, then I took the bin around the corner and he sniffed around a bit, as I turn around to call him back he just bolted.

He wouldn't listen to anything I would say or respond at all, only running further and faster away the closer I got. Eventually I got him back.

I don't blame him I'm sure from his perspective he thinks he did nothing wrong and just got to run around for a bit, I realise I should have noticed his excitement and praised him for the good behaviour and then put him inside to calm down. 

I'm wondering to anyone who is willing to offer advice, is there anyway to train this behaviour? Or is he just too excitable outside to be left unleashed? What might have been his reasoning or his behaviour or thought process to make him bolt and stop listening? 

I dont understand dog behaviour all that well yet, so I just assume he was too hyped and excited to properly understand or register my commands?",KyleCubed3,2022-11-05,10:08:24,2022,11,5,10,8,Saturday

0,DogAdvice,"[Tagged rant] People who can't read emotions well on other people, are the most likely to be scared of dogs.","Disclaimer: this is just an opinion, singular POV, everyone has different experiences with raising dogs and use of hyperbolic language is used to highlight a particular point. So let's be nice to each other.

Whenever someone has a particular fear or intense dislike of a certain breed of dog I always think it's because they struggle to pick up on other people's emotions when they're looking at that person's face.

For example, when a scary looking man shows no emotion on their face while making direct eye contact with you it's very unsettling. Imagine not being able to look at a dog and figure out how that dog is feeling in that moment. You wouldn't be able to effectively raise that dog without being able to pick up on it's emotional energy so you can steer the dog towards the correct behaviour. 

When young and learning your mind is very plastic. Puppy's seem to have a way they go through life in those early stages. Which is made easier to keep the puppy calm when you know how to react to it's actions. When a 15kg ball of cunt comes bundling at you, barking and growling like something kicked it in the nut sack, shaking like a cat shitting razorblades. And you panic, then you're only going to make the fucker freak out more by acting like an absolute twat and screaming your head off. You'll be raising a toddler killing machine by the time of it's 4th year or worse getting your face eaten while you're sleeping.

Just get a toy breed instead as you're clearly looking for a baby to keep basically from cradle to grave. Log on to the KC, check the inbreeding coefficient percentages of ancestral lines for 8 generations of Cavapoo and make sure that puppy doesn't have any illnesseses or genetic disorders that cripple the fucker all 7 long years of its aching life.

Or better yet, grab a mutt thats been moved 7 times in 1.5 years that desperately wants to maul another child due to its terrier traits.

Fucking waste of time. People make bad mistakes all the time. People get hurt in all sorts of ways because of our mistakes. Just stop fighting with each other about how to properly stop this issue. Whether it be kill all of them and make some dumpster meat or it's all love #nobaddogonlybadowners both camps make me sick.

There's a wealth of knowledge out there about how to raise great dogs of all breeds, whether you want smashed and slammed or pure bred crufts champion. It's easy to understand what each dog breed requires to not grow up a dick so it lives a long and healthy life.

Stop pretending you know more than others because you watched 75 hours of Yankies breeding the love out of GSDs through ""what to do to raise a great German Shepherd and why they're the perfect canine companions"".

0,DogAdvice,How to deal with neighbour‚Äôs biting dogs,"I live in a block of flats, with narrow hallways on each floor, which connect lifts, the stairwell and the doors of the individual units. My neighbour has 2 chihuahuas and her door is just next to the lifts, so I need to wait there for the lifts and get off there when exiting the lifts. One of her dogs bit me two times. 

First, she opened the door and the dog immediately ran out and bit the back of my leg, in less than 2 seconds, as I was waiting less then 2 meters from her door for the lift (the lifts are exactly near her door). She did not apologise, but asked me if the dog did me any damage and then just took the dog back in an slammed the door. Second time, her dog ran into the lift when I was returning home, and in less the 2 seconds bit my shoe. She was in her flat, but left the door open for some reason and the dogs were on the hallway. She also opens the door, and lets the dogs out on the hallway while they wear extensible leads, and they act aggressively towards me when i exit the lift and then get in the lift WHILE WEARING LEADS (so they might get strangled if someone calls the lift).

I tried to talk to her, but was impossible. She yelled that her dogs never bite, and when they bite it doesn‚Äôt matter as they are smaller then cats (yes, great logic). The she proceeded to yell ‚Äúdo you want me to sacrifice them? Do you want to go to the police?‚Äù with her kids present, while I told her that I just wanted the dogs to wear leads and not be unsupervised, as bites can get infected. So talking to the woman is out of the question, and I am trying to reason with the dogs instead.

I had 3 dogs as a kid (ex-stray dogs in the countryside so very different setup) and never seen this behaviour. My guess is that the chihuahua that bit me is super territorial and thinks the hallway is his home too, and is probably scared when seeing strangers. So far I tried talking to it calmly, calling it cutes names, and pushing him away with my bag when it tries to jump at my ankles. But this is getting ridiculous. I started having my phone ready to record and further interactions, as the owner of f the dogs calls me a liar even if she saw the first bite. I don‚Äôt want to sue or anything like that, but in this province the authorities will make the owner vaccinate the dog for rabies/do some classes if you prove they bite (rabies vaccine is not mandatory otherwise which is stupid - this is a rabies free country in Europe except few incidents). 

Any idea what I could try next? Maybe crouch and sweet talk the dogs? I want to start a family soon, and really don‚Äôt want to keep having to be on the lookout for untrained dogs every time I go in/out of my flat when pregnant or with a pram.",garden_gate_key,2022-11-05,05:59:25,2022,11,5,5,59,Saturday
0,DogAdvice,Have any of you guys tried using dog diapers when visiting other‚Äôs houses?,"So I have a female cocker, aged 3. She was spayed later in life and has a habit of marking territory. Before anyone asks, we‚Äôve ruled out medical issues with a vet. 

She marks multiple times during walks (the smallest amounts), marks after seeing another dog, has marked on her new beds, and if shes in someone else‚Äôs house she will try to mark indoors despite being house trained. It‚Äôs not super often that she will mark indoors, but it‚Äôs unpredictable enough to where I get nervous bringing her to someone‚Äôs house.

We don‚Äôt know yet if she will ever stop the behavior, but I don‚Äôt want this to mean she can‚Äôt come with us on adventures. And I certainly don‚Äôt want it to mean I have to board her when I want to see family out of concern for her marking habits. She‚Äôs perfect to me and holds her bladder just fine, it‚Äôs just that she marks sometimes. 

Anyway, are dog diapers a good solution to this? I would only have them on her when she is indoors at a stranger‚Äôs house. I trust she wouldn‚Äôt release a bladder‚Äôs worth of pee into it. And she would do just fine sleeping with it off. Has anyone tried this? Or is there a secret training solution I need? Because I‚Äôm open to that too, lol!

0,DogAdvice,littermate syndrome continuation?,"I just had a quick question out of curiosity? 
We rescued our now 6.5 year old (""D"") from a littermate syndrome home life... it was not a good one, it was to the point the siblings were fighting pretty bad and he has scars from it. But he bonded almost immediately with our now 3.5 year old (""C"") rescue we already had at home who came from a completely different bad situation (he was kept in a yard from birth - mom and siblings taken away at a younger age - and not really able to socialize beyond what he could see) thankfully our first rescue though skittish at times has taken to things SO well and we've had him for 3 + years or so now and our 6.5 year old we've had for roughly 2 years or so. I think ""C"" really helped ""D"" with the transition originally! 

I give a little background because I was wondering if the littermate syndrome traits could continue over and that's something that needs to be worried about? ""D"" completely bonded to ""C"" and honestly we joke he likes him more than either of us as his owners, ""C"" was more a people dog but has become very close to ""D"" over the years as well!

0,DogAdvice,Issues With Collie,"Hi!
I adopted a collie bitch in August. She is the cutest thing ever and shows as very timid (I don't know how she's ended up at a rescue but her behaviour suggests she has been hit in the past).

It's now November and whilst I love her to bits, I'm having reoccurring issues that are starting to make me regret rehoming her. Issues like;

- she pees. EVERYWHERE. Due to constantly chewing she sleeps in a dog crate (which is roomy as hell). When she gets put in - she pees. When she gets let out, she pees. She gets excited - and pees. It's getting to the point now where I'm having to wash my towels and blankets constantly because she's either peeing on them, or im having to clean it up. To make it worse, she pees and then rolls in it which means I have to bathe her at least once a day.

- she chews. Everything. I've went through 4 quilts, two blankets and two dog beds. I feel awful because she has nothing in her crate to lie on, but whatever I put in with her she'll chew it and I don't want to risk issues such as threads causing intestinal problems and so on.

I'm getting to the point now where I feel I'm not giving her a good enough home, and heavily considering either taking her back to the rescue or seeing if someone else can rehome her.

Any advice?

0,DogAdvice,Big dog jumped me and my puppy,"So for context, I have a puppy that is 6 months old. I walk her around a park that is in front of my house. Lately, there has been a stray that someone has been taking care of, letting him at night but then letting him roam freely during the day. He‚Äôs a pretty big dog. He isn‚Äôt unfriendly, and it‚Äôs quite clear he wants to play. However, I think he is in heat because he starts chasing my puppy, nipping her back and trying to pin her down. Before I would just see it as play, but lately she has started to squeal and runs away from him. This time I couldn‚Äôt even go home because he kept following us and my leash would get tangled. When I picked her up (and I know this shouldn‚Äôt be done but I really wanted to get out of the way) the dog started jumping on me and biting my coat. I started screaming at it to go away but the dog just kept jumping at my arm and my dog.  A few guys came to hold him back for a little bit, they knew his name clearly and told me ‚Äúhe just wants to play.‚Äù They tried to hold him back a but but they soon let him go and basically he spent the while way jumping me and biting my coat. He‚Äôs pretty big and heavy and could have easily knocked him over.

0,DogAdvice,I sent this message to the moderators of this sub. I am honestly so sick of the judgmental culture of /DogAdvice,"I do not care if this gets downvoted a thousand times. I sent this message to the moderators, and I'm posting here because I HOPE that some of you look more critically at how you are commenting on people's posts. I have absolutely never in my life written a note like this to anyone. 

For context, I am a new dog owner and post in this sub when I'm not sure how to Google a question, or when I do Google a question it comes up with totally different results and not at all answering the question that I actually have. I never had dogs growing up because my sister was allergic. I adore dogs, and fell in love with one at the shelter who had been taken in as a stray. I love this dog with my whole heart and all I want to do is give him a good home. Yet, every time I post any fucking question on this sub I am met with judgmental comments. And it's not like I am the only one. I've seen so many times posters being shamed for not taking their dogs to the vet sooner, etc. DogAdvice, do better. 

Below is the message I sent. 

\-------- 

I've been a dog owner for about 4 months, so I've been on this sub for about the same amount of time. In the four months I've used this sub for help with my dog, as a NEW DOG OWNER, I have to say I find the culture of DogAdvice to be absolutely shocking. 

Commenters are constantly shaming posters for not bringing their dog to the vet sooner - when if you're posting on this sub in the first place, it's probably because you cannot afford to take your dog to the vet for every single thing that happens. Someone LITERALLY told me today to ""not rely on social media for my dogs needs"" ????? This is DogAdvice, a forum for help with dogs. 

If this was a one-off fluke I'd think nothing of it. But the sad truth is that this has been my experience on this subreddit. It's abhorrent. This is supposed to be a positive place to discuss things we need help with when it comes to our dogs, and the fact of the matter is, this subreddit is a horrendous, judgmental, MEAN place for people to be pretentious about their knowledge of dogs and look down on anyone who is new or learning or simply ignorant. 

You should not need a PhD in dog training (yes, I know that's not a thing) to rescue a dog from a shelter, but this sub has created a culture that makes anyone posting feel as though that's the prerequisite. 

And the fact of the matter is that you all are the moderators. I know this isn't a paid position, I'm not under some delusion that you all have the time and energy to devote to making this place so positive and great and helpful only. But put in the minimum effort. 

I should NOT be made to feel like shit every time I post a question in this sub. Do better. I'm honestly disappointed in all of the mods of this subreddit.",sealprint,2022-11-05,00:15:24,2022,11,5,0,15,Saturday

0,DogAdvice,Dog suddenly lifting his leg on people at the dog park?,"I‚Äôve had my rescue lab mix (2 y/o, male) for 4 months. He‚Äôs been doing great at the dog park and learning lots of socialization through play. 

On Monday, I saw he briefly lifted his leg on a person as if he was about to pee on her. I was horrified and immediately told him to leave it. She was very nice about it, and he didn‚Äôt do it again. That was the last time we were at the park.

Today, Thursday, three days later. He did the same thing to an owner. And then he did it to a female puppy. I believe this puppy wasn‚Äôt spayed yet as she was only 9 months, and I thought maybe he was fixated on her because of that? He is neutered and in the four months we‚Äôve had him I‚Äôve never seen him hump, so I thought it might be a dominance thing? 

I‚Äôm just guessing! I‚Äôm at a total loss! Why would he start doing this all of a sudden? He meets new people frequently, not just at the dog park but friends of ours etc., and frequently gets play. We‚Äôve been 80% consistent with him in regard to getting his needs met, obedience training, routine, etc. ‚Äî shooting for 100% but it‚Äôs of course hard to be perfect. 

We‚Äôve told him to leave it, and after he lifted on the puppy we left the park. 

Also a note ‚Äî he is neutered, but he was neutered as an adult when he was first taken in to the humane society.

He had a spinal injury and is healing good right now. He is on steroids and muscle relaxers. Steroids are making him aggressively hungry so we have been feeding him a few kibbles more (vet allowed us to since he keeps scavenging). 

We started yesterday and today he pooped 4x today. Surprising to us. we will probably feed him a normal portion tomorrow instead. His poop is normal as well in consistency and color. He is not struggling to poop or anything.

0,DogAdvice,Puppy ate pieces of pee pad,I recently left my 10 week old french bulldog with a family member since I needed to go run an errand. I came back home and saw there was scraps of the pad gone. He had a small piece in his bed and I saw he ate it as well. I worry because it‚Äôs my first time having a puppy. I took him out about 5 minutes after and he had a little trouble pooping and definitely seemed like diarrhea. Wasn‚Äôt fully liquid but was definitely not close to solid like before. He went again about an hour later as well. It was a little more close to solid this time. Will his poop go back to normal and everything be alright soon? Or is this something to be very worried about.

0,DogAdvice,Eucalyptus Ingestion Panic,"I just got home from work and it appears my 1yr old dog ate a sprig of Eucalyptus that was up on a counter. Now I'm reading it's toxic and obviously freaking out.

We don't have a regular vet (not for lack of trying) and I am very concerned but I don't want to internet sabotage myself into a total panic attack WebMD style by reading horror stories or potentially contradictory statements. Emergency vets here are several hundred dollars to get an appt, even the ASPCA poison line is nearly 100$ and I'm concerned they'll just tell me to watch for symptoms and try to make a vet appt.

She's currently fine personality/energy wise, but obviously things can take time to cause harm. I also read if dog ingest something toxic not to feed or water them, but could that just be for potentially more severe cases (say, a pallet of chocolate) Is it better to make sure she has a lot of water possibly? 

Diarrhea, vomiting, salivating are apparent signs of toxic ingestion. If we have signs does that mean she needs medical intervention and the Eucalyptus is doing serious damage to her, or that it's upset her stomach and I'm simply going to have some days of taking care of vomiting and diarrhea?

Any potential advice would be greatly appreciated. Currently going to stay up late and watch her and check what our vet options are if this takes a turn.",kelsbby,2022-11-04,09:49:36,2022,11,4,9,49,Friday

0,DogAdvice,Why did my dog get aggressive at the dog park?,"We were at the dog park. It was my first time letting her meet dogs at the dog park. Usually, we go when she is alone. The first dog she met, I let them meet with her on leash, then they played great with no signs of aggression. The second dog, I kept her restrained at first, just like with the first dog. And the other two dogs played very rambunctiously. I kept waiting for them to calm down, which they didn‚Äôt. My dog had a calm body posture, it seemed, but I know now the intense staring she was doing was my major cue that she was feeling fearful. I made the mistake of letting go of her collar so she could go run with them, as I was feeling pressure from the other dog owners to let her go. She immediately ran up to the new dog and snapped at him. He didn‚Äôt back down and they ended up in a big fight. I‚Äôm wondering why this happened and how to avoid it in the future. Should I wait until the dogs are calm going forward? Should I stick to one dog at a time? Or just avoid the dog park altogether? Any advice on how to properly introduce dogs would be greatly appreciated, as I would like to be a more responsible dog owner and avoid these interactions while also promoting positive play with new dogs.",mymistresseseyes,2022-11-04,07:50:00,2022,11,4,7,50,Friday

0,DogAdvice,Does this look more like a bug bite or ringworm?,"https://imgur.com/a/4JfI5aD

Disclaimer: My mom is in the process of making my dog a vet appointment. I would never solely rely on the internet for a diagnosis of something like this, I‚Äôm just nervous and want to know what people think about this mark until I can get her to the vet within a few days :)

I noticed this mark on my 10 year old female dog‚Äôs neck last night. It‚Äôs a pretty even circle shape, but it looks like more of an oval in the picture because she kept turning her head lol. It‚Äôs pretty small, maybe 1/2 inch - 3/4 inch in diameter? You can see the size of it compared to my finger.

She hasn‚Äôt been trying to scratch it or anything, I don‚Äôt think she even knows it‚Äôs there. She‚Äôs been acting perfectly normal; eating normally, playing, etc. So far I haven‚Äôt noticed any scaliness or hair loss around the mark. 

She hasn‚Äôt been in contact with any other dogs, and we don‚Äôt have any other pets. We have an enclosed backyard with a locked gate where we let her go outside with supervision. 

I‚Äôve looked at a lot of pictures of ringworm marks and bug bites, and honestly a lot of them look exactly the same, so it‚Äôs hard for me to tell what it might be. The tiny dot in the middle makes me think it could be a bug bite, or at least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm telling myself because I really don‚Äôt want to have to sanitize my entire house to get rid of ringworm lol :‚Äô)

Please let me know what you think! It‚Äôs definitely hard to identify, but I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs people on this sub who know more than me.",afemail,2022-11-04,05:14:54,2022,11,4,5,14,Friday
0,DogAdvice,Post-Surgery Irritability,"My 7 year old mini American Eskimo male dog just had surgery on his eyelid to remove a mass.

After a normal vet visit, he‚Äôll typically be pretty groggy and cuddly. Currently, however, he‚Äôs growling at nothing and seems extremely grumpy. He even barked once.

There‚Äôs a lot that‚Äôs different about this visit compared to the check ups: the surgery, obviously, the stitches, the cone, etc. If I were him I‚Äôd be irritable too! so I understand his behavior could be very normal, but it‚Äôs just not what I‚Äôm accustomed to for him. The vet is closed and I‚Äôll check in with them in the morning, but in the meantime, does this sound like concerning behavior or par for the course?

0,DogAdvice,Enlarged prostate in neutered male dog?,"It‚Äôs been a few weeks now since my dog has started having difficulties passing stool. The first time I took him to the vet, he had X-rays done which showed that he was impacted. The vet put him under anaesthesia and administered an enema and removed all the fecal matter. The vet also gave him some steroids to help with inflammation but he continued to strain. We went back to the vet the next day, had another dose of steroids and went home with some enulose and prescription GI food. My dog was not getting any better so we went back to the vet, did more X-rays and saw that something is pressing up and pinching his colon. We then took him to an imaging place where they did ultrasounds and saw that his bladder, urethra, and prostate were bigger than normal. We did a UA the first time we went to the vet and they did not find anything abnormal. We‚Äôre now on day 3 of high dose steroids + antibiotics (baytril) and things aren‚Äôt improving. I am at a complete loss, and I don‚Äôt know how I can help the little guy get back to his normal healthy self.

Our vet has been amazing trying to work with us and help my dog get better. I don‚Äôt have pet insurance and specialists are just out of my budget. Is there anyone here that can give any advise or have any ideas of what might be causing all of this?

My dog is a 10yo 5 lb neutered male Yorkie. He is having difficulties urinating and defecating. He‚Äôs eating just fine but not drinking as much as he normally does. I actually don‚Äôt ever see him go to the water bowl anymore. I have been adding water to his food to make sure that he stays hydrated.
Also, all of this started when we got him on Prozac. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just a coincidence or if there‚Äôs a link between all of his symptoms and Prozac. We took him off Prozac a week ago.

IF he had prostatitis, how long does it normally take to notice symptoms getting better while on baytril?

0,DogAdvice,My dog doesn‚Äôt trust us and it bothers me,"I (20F) live with my parents. We bought a purebred American Bully and she is about to turn 3. She was sold with full rights so we received her with her registration, she is health cleared, no behavioral issues and I was familiar with her parents AND breeder before she was even born. 

Since bringing her home at 14 weeks old she has always acted this way. If any of us take a stern tone (not yelling, just a firm ‚Äúno‚Äù or anything), she runs and bolts under the table. She will hurt us or herself to get away from us when she is scared (we do not hurt her, or any of our dogs in any way). She shakes like crazy if we try to trim her nails and sometimes even screams even though I never hit her quick, I can‚Äôt roll her on her back (to check for cuts, scrapes and etc.) because she‚Äôll fight me as hard as she can, and she barely lets me treat any cuts or scrapes if I do find any (she has head butted me in the nose out of fear when I‚Äôve tried to treat her cuts). Every time I pick up her bowl to feed her, she runs under the table and doesn‚Äôt come out till I leave the room. No idea why she does that and she only does it to me. She follows my parents if they have her bowl. She also sometimes runs from me if she‚Äôs outside my room door and I come out, and again hides until I pass. This is not it but these are the ones that occur most frequently. The ‚Äúfear‚Äù does seem to be towards me a lot of the time. 

I do have two other dogs and I can do anything I need to. I can roll them on their backs, trim their nails and check tor cuts. They trust me and every dog I‚Äôve owned before her has trusted me as well. I work to condition them to these things so they won‚Äôt be scared, but this conditioning didn‚Äôt happen with my bully because I was in college while she was growing up. My family doesn‚Äôt take it as seriously as me. 

I guess it kind of offends me or hurts my feelings that my dog acts like I am dangerous and feels that she needs to hide from me. Especially since I care so much about my dogs feeling safe in our home and trusting us. 

Her personality outside of this is ok. She is always super happy to see us, licks us EXCESSIVELY and she wants to be wherever we are, if not in her cage (we leave it open so she can go in whenever). I take her on walks, and train her and do most of that stuff. She is shy around people but warms up. She has never growled or showed us aggression. We can take any bone from her or take her food (though we don‚Äôt unless it‚Äôs urgent). She walks perfectly on a leash and is trustable off leash. Recall is immaculate, no reactivity to other dogs or humans (and even if she does react to the odd barking dog one correction is enough to stop it). 

The only thing I can think of is that she was born in a rural area where it was extremely quiet, and now she‚Äôs in a city which is obviously louder and way more stimulation. But I thought she‚Äôd get used to this eventually. With the excessive licking and overreaction to things I‚Äôm suspecting anxiety maybe? Is it possible it‚Äôs something her breeder did? I‚Äôm not sure how to approach this issue. 

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.",ihavealotofissueslol,2022-11-04,01:52:20,2022,11,4,1,52,Friday

0,DogAdvice,lump experience/ banefeild and addition insurance question," 

my sweet baby (7, baby to me) rescue pibbie mix has had a lump for about a year now, but it came and went. Shes an active lean little one, 48lbs Now this week, it seems harder ((before I get roasted , my ex assured me it was normal and shes my first dog so I listened to him instead of going to the vet immediately- but her august visit the lump was hardly there, and the vet didnt say anything about it\*) And the lump moves with the skin (aka not moveable). Somedays its hard/ sometimes its soft, somedays its barely present. Its on her pack like by her shoulder blade/ lung area- when she has her harness on the strap ends at it almost making wonder if theres an irritation thing. (IDK) So I have an apt the 18th to get it looked at then go from there. It doesnt hurt her when I touch it/ mess with it (gently). No changes to a single thing with her. last month bloodwork was perfect. her energy is psycho. he appetite is wild. well hydrated. So I'm hoping this isnt a MCT. It just looks like her fur is raised.

My question is:

I have banefeild. For a visit, its great, wellness is covered. They said come get it looked at, and from there they will fine needle aspirate, etc etc etc. That part is covered minus the FNA and biopsy.... I am wondering if since this visit is far out, I should obtain additional cheap insurance just incase all my fears on googling are true (mast cell/ cancer/ im very scared shes all i have in this life). In addition to this all, Shes getting two toothies pulled in December. (this isn't our year). So I am stressed to the max.

0,DogAdvice,Help! My dog destroys everything,"Almost a year ago my partner and I got a puppy, he's predominantly blue heeler/husky/German shepherd so he's very high energy which is fine because we live next to a field and exercise him multiple times a day. We try to switch up the exercises to keep him engaged and give him some mental stimulation as well, and at home he has a ton of different types of toys. The issue is we can't leave the house or take our eyes off him ever, he's kennel trained and when we're gone he's put in his kennel with a few of his toys, but he's destroyed 3 separate types of kennels and we can't afford to replace them anymore, the last one was $200 and we have to manhandle the door to get it shut. When he busts out of the kennel he acts awful, he's destroyed shoes, clothes, chargers, art supplies, cords, etc. The worst thing he destroyed was a very sentimental homemade blanket, and to add insult to injury it's ONLY my stuff he destroys, never my partners stuff or anything that belongs to both of us. We thought it was separation anxiety at first, but if I'm on the phone in the same room or watching a movie or basically anything that isn't staring directly at him constantly he'll chew things, we've tried the bitter apple spray and a remote that makes a sound and has lights that's supposed to make him associate the behavior with negative things and he doesn't change. We can't afford a professional trainer, but I've called trainers and received toy recommendations as well as training methods to try, he loved the toys but it didn't slow down the chewing at all and the training methods were useless. He does great with other pets, acts amazing when we take him to PetSmart, and we never have to worry about leash pulling or him running off when he's not leashed. He does bark and growl nonstop when people come over but I think that's unrelated to the main behavior issues.  Our other dog is twice his size (bull mastiff) and has never broke out of a kennel or destroyed anything even though I'm sure he easily could, they were raised the same exact way so I'm not sure why he's such a problem child. We literally use cinder blocks and thick wire to keep him in the kennel when we're gone and NOTHING works, he's managed to bust out of every type of kennel that we can afford and I can't deal with it anymore. We have a baby due in April and I don't even want to think about trying to afford replacing all of the stuff he destroys on top of the price of having a baby. Let alone the mess we're inevitably gonna come home to after I come home from the hospital after labor.

0,DogAdvice,MILs new rescue dog is terrified of my high energy dog,"My MIL surprised us by bringing home a new rescue dog on Tuesday, some kind of pitbull mix. Shes very cute and kind, but clearly has trauma because you could scare her by just walking in her direction, but we are slowly helping her learn the family routine. 

That being said, our 3 dogs spend all their time with us in the upstairs part of the house and MIL has the downstairs, though she usually keeps her dog in her room with her. We have a particularly excited dog, he really really wants to play with her, but he also doesn't understand her social cues. Hes bigger than her by probably over 50 pounds.

She screams if he does a fast play bow or does anything too fast, shes absolutely terrified of him and has even peed. But he does not stop when she screams, he continues to antagonize and try to play which I dont like, he isnt picking up on her cues. I seem to be the only one concerned about their relationship, thats why im posting here. 

She DOES want to play with him, she happily plays with our other 2 dogs, and will whine and sometimes try to play bow with him, but the second he tries to play back she screams and runs :(

0,DogAdvice,Would you prioritize a specific vet or your dogs post-surgery comfort?,"My dog was recently diagnosed with some kind of mass on her forearm. It looks like a button tumor and the vet said it could either be a histiocytoma or the dreaded mast cell tumor. Based on her age (we think around 5 yrs), breed (husky/lab mix) and the appearance of the tumor, I‚Äôm leaning towards mast cell. 

Our vet didn‚Äôt want to do a needle aspiration because the size and location would make it difficult to do without risking degranulation. She told me to wait and see if it grows over the next few weeks. I obviously do not want to wait for it to grow since I know the sooner MCTs are removed, the better. 

We‚Äôve been seeing this vet for a year but I don‚Äôt have full faith in her for this situation. My family vet back home has cared for and done surgery on my childhood dogs for the past 10 years. I trust her way, way more. I‚Äôm planning on going home soon and would like her to take a look at it and remove it. 

My dog doesn‚Äôt really like being at my family home. We have other dogs there that make her nervous and she tends to hide most of the day. 

**Is it better to go see the vet I trust to take care of this but have my dog recover in an unfamiliar and nervewracking environment? Or is it better to use a vet I don‚Äôt trust as much and allow my dog to recover in the comfort of her own home?**",tackyshark,2022-11-03,19:22:57,2022,11,3,19,22,Thursday

0,DogAdvice,Breathable Crate Covers for Summer,"Hi Redditors,

We have an Australian Shepherd and live in Australia (funny story.. Aussie shepherds are not Australian and are quite rare here!).

We're approaching summer here where it's going to get quite hot. Our boy spends a lot of time in his crate as he's puppy and enjoys it to chill out.

It appears most crate covers are waterproof and made of thick material (like his current one), so we worry they're not so breathable when temperatures hit 30-40¬∞C (85 - 100¬∞F).

Wondering if anyone can recommend or knows of a light weight breathable crate cover?",cmtd19,2022-11-03,14:07:50,2022,11,3,14,7,Thursday
0,DogAdvice,My adult dogs fur is changing colour in patches,"My dog is a 2 year old blonde cavoodle. About 3 months ago I noticed that he had a patch of dark brown straight hair (the rest of him is quite curly) about the size of a grape, on his back close to his tail. I didn‚Äôt think much of it but about a month ago I noticed another one on his other side. 

His hair had gotten quite long and we‚Äôre starting to get warmer weather where we are so he had a clip today and had about half his coat removed. I came to pick him up and was shocked to realise that he has about 8 of these patches over the back half of his body which is really noticeable now and makes him look very patchy rather than just the one colour he usually is.

Does anybody know what might be causing this? Appreciate any feedback, I‚Äôve booked him into his vet but won‚Äôt be for 2 days so i‚Äôm losing my mind at the moment wondering if it‚Äôs anything sinister.

0,DogAdvice,My dog doesn't like when my boyfriend and I cuddle,"My boyfriend and I got our dog, Luna, when she was 2 months old. She turns 1 years old this month. We live together and have raised her together. Whenever I go to cuddle my boyfriend or he cuddles me, she becomes extremely protective. I'm not sure who she's trying to protect. She jumps on top of us, barks, tries to shove in between us and just goes full on feral. She even nipped at my boyfriend. She doesn't sleep upstairs with us and she only does this when we try to cuddle on the couch. We can't cuddle for 5 seconds without her freaking out. Does anyone know why she's doing this? And how we can stop it? She acts like it's the end of the world whenever we show any kind of intimacy toward each other. Other than that she's a great dog and we have no other issues. I read that she could think that we are fighting, but I'm not sure. She even barks when we kiss each other and then we put our face to hers and she gives us kisses.

He doesn't come or look at me when I call his name if he's faced away like he used to, and he doesn't come inside when we call him in. It seems like he's ""ignoring us"" but I don't think that's it as it only happends when he isn't looking right at us for our body language. He comes and reacts when we do gestures like patting my legs for him to come to bed, but that's about it. Is he going deaf? And if he is, how do I take care of him better? We will probably go to the vet to see if he is actually going deaf or not but it would be nice to get some advice on the matter as I have never had a deaf dog (other than a 15-year-old dog that passed away a few years ago).",IcySpizey,2022-11-03,12:28:22,2022,11,3,12,28,Thursday
0,DogAdvice,"Help, how do I off leash train my dog?","So years ago I got a dog as a child from a shelter. That dog never would run away from the house or when off leash. Now I got another dog for a while (5 turning 6) and she bolts when given the opportunity. I don‚Äôt understand, it‚Äôs not like I abuse her. I take her on walks daily (leashed ofc) and feed in the morning and night a small amount for lunch (because she ends up throwing up the kibble if I give her a proper lunch) and give her water when it goes low. I pet her and love her like any other human being who loves their dog. But she always runs out, either be it an open gate in the backyard, open door in the house, the leash slipping out of my hand, even when the car door opens and I don‚Äôt grab the leash in time. I am genuinely scared for her life as she runs around and doesn‚Äôt seem to understand that the main roads have speeding cars that could hit her. And when she runs she doesn‚Äôt listen to my voice or with treats. Of course I don‚Äôt chase her, I stay from a distant and try to call her. I always lock and double check all the gates and doors before letting her into the backyard and/or back into the house. But rarely I slip up and she runs. She is microchipped from the shelter but that wont stop her from running into the roads. All the times I got her back was either: she stopped to use the bathroom, got tired and collapsed on the ground, or the time where she ran to a walking stranger to lick them. One time she ran into a main road and cars were slamming their brakes and swerving to avoid her. But she didn‚Äôt even notice. I moved recently and my street is beside a highway. It‚Äôs only less than 50 yards from my house and ppl there speed a lot has there is a long slow winding road and some people definitely go 100-110 (I live in the US, so that‚Äôs mph) I am actually fearful that the next time it happens I may not find her or she will be hit by a car.",Generik_Userz,2022-11-03,11:10:07,2022,11,3,11,10,Thursday

0,DogAdvice,puppy whiny all the time?,"About a month ago, I got 2, 8 weeks old puppies from my little cousin, whose dog had given birth to a litter. One is black and the other is brown. I'm unsure of the exact breeds but I think they and their parents are mutts with german shepard and/or lab mix in there somewhere.

The black puppy at first was quite shy and timid, &amp; would wag its tail at people but then walk away if you tried to pet it. He's gotten less shy &amp; gets pet. Also pretty quiet besides barking every now and again. The brown one was and still is very excitable and loves attention, and frequently would bark. 

But now the brown ones is SO whiny and I don't know why. He wants to be pet, but if you do something like gently brush up against him with your leg, he'll start whining and yelping like you just stepped on his tail. But he doesn't cry when he's getting petting and attention. It's gotten worse now where about 70% of the time he's whining, barking, and yelping like he's dying, and he does it more if he sees you through the window or you pass him by. The black puppy occasionally whines, but never like the brown one. We feed the puppies regularly and I try to play with them when I go on walks outside, and so do the rest of my household, and they have toys and even other dogs to play with outside (we have 2 other dogs previous to the puppies, &amp; they do play together)

What's the deal?? It's SO annoying to hear him freak out all the time. And it can't be because he misses his mom, because he was literally quieter and better behaved when we FIRST got him. How do I make it stop??",Artistic_Yak_3157,2022-11-03,09:07:54,2022,11,3,9,7,Thursday

I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôs ingested some ibuprofen as I‚Äôm worried that even if she ingested less than a quarter of a tablet that could be potentially dangerous. I cannot contact the vet until the morning, and I don‚Äôt know what to do?!

I think this was maybe an hour ago she did this, but she seems okay currently, no panting, no vomiting if anything she‚Äôs just being cheeky as usual.

0,DogAdvice,Anyone ever experienced this?,"Hello everyone, I posted this in another community as well but I wanted another perspective on my aussies condition and if anyone has experienced this with their dog. 

My mini Aussie has been dealing with some nail bed issues as of recently. He had already gone to the vet for it multiple times and I‚Äôm curious if this is truly an allergic reaction or nailbed infection. About a few weeks ago on oct 3 my dog had gotten a dark tar substance on his nailbed and the entire thing was swollen. It started as one nail and we used iodine soaks and chlorhexidine wipes provided by our vet. The iodine actually worked very well with it as it cleared up quicker. But when we went back for our first follow up they suggested to remove the iodine and continue using the wipes. It got worse again. Then on our second follow up they suggested a cytopoint injection but no antibiotics. They didn‚Äôt give me a clear diagnosis all they said was that the injection would help. Now we‚Äôre on our third follow up because the second nail right next to that first nail on the same paw has also now became raw red with the same tar substance at the bed of the nail. Now I‚Äôm using the iodine soaks again to make sure it‚Äôs not bacterial. His other paws are nowhere near this red and raw especially because I‚Äôve always known he‚Äôs had allergies and he take probiotics etc.

0,DogAdvice,New Rescue Won't Go To The Bathroom,"Hi!
 
I know there are a lot of these posts‚Äîand I have scoured through them! I just am wondering if my situation has some additional kinks in it. I adopted an 8-year-old Beagi rescue over the weekend, and he came home with me yesterday. I live in a second story apartment with no fenced yard--there is a grassy area between a couple of the buildings and to the side along the sidewalk. There is a large open area behind my building that goes into a walking path along a creek that extends into a large field with many paths.
 
When I applied for him, the foster mom let me know that he would attempt small stairs, but he wouldn't attempt the larger 15 step staircase in his foster home. I was initially worried, because I have 12 stairs that are carpeted and not too steep, but I am also no stranger to carrying dogs up and down as my established 11yr old corgi mix can struggle with soreness sometimes.
 
Despite this, the rescue determined I was a good fit, as they saw the stairs, my apartment and the outdoor area and path in a virtual visit.
 
He is such a sweet boy--he and my other guy get along great. He is super quiet and prefers to lay in his bed most of the day, but literally ""bounces"" when food is involved. He's a bit overweight and very bow legged (I am working on getting records from the rescue and taking him to the vet on Friday), so I wasn't sure how he would do walking, especially on a leash, but with a harness and leash, he ends up cruising well! He also is totally okay with going down my stairs--he won't go up right now.
 
The problem is, I cannot get him to go potty on the leash, and I do not want to let him off given my situation! He seems generally fearful of going outside. I don't blame him, it's scary out there in a new place! We have tried walking, we have tried standing in place with me ignoring him and just giving him time, etc. My other dude will potty right in front of him, and half the time he won't even sniff or show interest. He just seems really overwhelmed out there.
 
This morning I tried for half an hour to get him to go, but he seemed nervous, and nothing happened. I took him back in and fed him. While I was making my coffee, he suddenly darted to my room and when I peeked in there, he was circling and pawing as if he was about to potty. I diverted his attention, put him on the leash and we went out but...nothing. I took him to my mom's as I needed to drop something off, and to see if he would go in her fenced yard, at this point we were 24+ hours without a potty.
 
When I put him in her yard, he immediately went behind a tree and did both his things. This, coupled with him trying to go out of sight in my bedroom, leads me to believe he has some anxiety about me being close or watching. His foster mom said he would just paw at the door to be let out, and then run off and come back to be let in. My situation is very different, and I am so grateful he went, but it‚Äôs not a long-term solution. What worries me is that he just seems fearful of outside my apartment‚Äîwe have gone out and just sat to get used to everything. I am also bringing high value treats along when we go out. I just ordered a long lead, and he has a better fitting collar coming his way ASAP as well. I‚Äôm also not sure if me having to carry him back up the stairs makes him have a negative connotation with going out.
 
I know it‚Äôs a steep adjustment period, and patience is key, but I am so in my head and sooo worried I am letting this sweet little guy down. If anyone can offer additional advice, I would be so grateful!

0,DogAdvice,Moving with Dog - Canada to US (Really need HELP),"My partner and I are both moving because we have new jobs. We are shifting from Canada to US, and have a United flights booked. My partner has a dog who is trained as an ESA for his own health reasons. My question is how do people travel with dogs these days? I know rules changed this past year. I was told after November 3rd, it's too cold and dogs cannot go cargo. She is 22lbs, so she fits in the in-cabin carrier but she can't do spins in it (which I've heard they can reject you if she can't spin around).

It feels like the only options are to abandon our dog who is also an ESA or to get her retrained as a service animal?? There are long-haul shippers but I don't trust a 5 day drive with a trucker for my dog... 

Anyone have ANY advice at all on this?",crunchymunchyrae,2022-11-02,23:55:29,2022,11,2,23,55,Wednesday
0,DogAdvice,Food brand recommendations?,"It's time for our little gremlin to move on to adult dog food over the next few months now that he's finally a year old. 

Soo I'm looking for some suggestions of brands and such cause it's not quite simple as just grabbing the adult version due to his mixed diet, and until this dog, I've always been tending to ones with grain allergies/sensitive stomachs/etc/etc where the options were far more limited. I keep looking at all the hundreds of options I have with him and blanking lol. 

Due to a combination of hand-feed training and hunger strikes, he's on a mixed diet. 

Current diet 

Main/hand training food - Purina One puppy plus 1 1/2 cups

Hunger Strike Management- Purina puppy chow 1/2 cup twice a day mixed with Purina puppy wet food, this is occasionally heated on the stovetop if he's been hunger-striking for a few days. 

other details 

Miniature Australian 

 Activity Level - High energy breed, lower physical activity with higher mental activity, he's not running any just 3 20 minute walks a day, few play sessions, his primary forms of activity are things like assisting me around the house with cleaning from picking things up to helping make beds, constant learning, random tricks, herding his toys to another location on command, distracting me from panic attacks, etc.  

So each of the three components needs to be replaced one at a time and thus seeing what recommendations I get.

0,DogAdvice,Need help to understand my GR‚Äôs behavior,"Hi, good members of DogAdvice!

I have a 1.5 year old Golden retriever who recently went through his neutering surgery. All went good. 
However, ever since his surgery, he is a completely changed dog. 

He is more active, more playful, eating very enthusiastically (anything, everything he can get his boop on). There are some naughty behaviors from puppy stage that has made a comeback as well like leash biting. 
This is completely in contrast to his behaviors before neutering - he did not like his food; we kept changing his kibble brand but he would get bored in less than a week. Wouldn‚Äôt take any treats.
Was only ever interested in smelling pee on the walks. 

I am trying to understand what may be the cause of this? If anyone else have seen similar behavior. 
I am really positively surprised by these changes as my pup seems happy and full. Want to ensure that this behavior stays, well, except for leash biting, ofcourse.",redDeadRedemptor,2022-11-02,20:57:33,2022,11,2,20,57,Wednesday

0,DogAdvice,"My neighbor is taking my puppy for an hour each day to play with her dog, is it okay?","We adopted a cute 4-month puppy a month ago, at first she acted very badly with other dogs, snapped at them and was very aggressive. Then, on one of our walks, we met our neighbor with her dog. Ever since, my puppy and her dog have been good friends and always start to play when they meet. We started to hang out more and let them play. In the last couple of days, the neighbor asked us to take our dog for an hour to play with her dog in her apartment. I guess she just wanted her dog to leave her alone while she does her things, and I'm a student, so I'm happy to have a dog sitter so I can study quietly. At first it wasn't a problem, but now every time we go out for a walk, my puppy pulls towards her apartment and starts acting weird every walk, like she's looking for the neighbor's dog.

Yesterday, my partner brought her back from a walk and she always ran to me to say hi, but this time she went back outside to go to the neighbor's apartment.

I don't know if that's a bad thing, but I'm afraid that we are losing the bond we made with our puppy and now she prefers to go next door and play with the other dog.¬†",GalaxyBS,2022-11-02,15:32:20,2022,11,2,15,32,Wednesday

0,DogAdvice,Dog regurgitating portions of dry food?,"5 yr old labradoodle who‚Äôs never vomited before in the year I‚Äôve owned her. I put out dry food in the morning and with dinner, but she often doesn‚Äôt eat the morning portion until 12-4 pm if I‚Äôm home, and as I‚Äôve had the flu I‚Äôve been home sick. Housemate and I noticed on Monday that she coughed up some mucus/dry food pellet mix around 10 minutes after her afternoon walk. Skipped dinner, figuring it was a stomach upset. Fed breakfast again today and the same thing happened around 20 minutes after eating, but I wasn‚Äôt fast enough with cleanup and she ate it again and kept it all down. Same thing happened with dinner now, thus the post. I‚Äôd imagine the bits are around 1/4-1/2 of her food.

Other facts:
1. Routine is disrupted due to me being sick - could be anxiety related?
2. Has been getting less exercise as I have the flu and she refuses to be walked by housemate if I‚Äôm home, so while I let her in the fenced area there‚Äôs no morning walk and a shorter afternoon one.
3. Supposedly drank a bit of puddle water on the Monday attempt at a walk with housemate (that consisted of the end of the driveway then her best statue impression), so maybe that? Would suspect throat from pulling but she wears a harness - housemate admits they may have put it on improperly though.
4. Seems to have normal energy (she‚Äôs a v chill dog normally so hard to tell, plus I‚Äôm at around 50%)
5. Up to date on shots, heartworm, and flea/tick, none of which were recent applications.

So, do I need to go to the vet? Wait and see? Change up feeding schedule/add water to food? Asking here instead of immediate vet call because 1) this doesn‚Äôt read as ER levels and it‚Äôs after working hours and 2) I‚Äôm actively human ill and chances are animal doctors would not be enthused to see me.",ladyknights,2022-11-02,09:39:17,2022,11,2,9,39,Wednesday

0,DogAdvice,apparent resource guarding?,"I'm looking for advice or insight about my dog's possible resource guarding. I have border collie mix that I adopted at around 6 months old. She was kept with an abusive foster parent and has always had high anxiety and doesn't like other dogs or people. The only dog she's ever liked was my mother's cairn terrier, which she's been bonded with and lived with for 7 years. Up until recently there hasn't been any issues, but slowly over the course of the past year she has started getting very agressive with him at night and when she is being fed anything.  They both live with my mother (I decided to keep her there so she wouldnt be seperated from her dog) so I don't have direct control over these situations. 

I thought the issue at night may be her anxiety and possible poor eyesight (she's a genetic mess), but then it started happening at food times or now anytime they get treats- growling, snapping, and chasing him. 

They are fed in separate areas, and almost always have food in their bowl as my mom let's them graze for the most part. The terrier doesn't go to her food bowl, he always eats out of his own.

I'm not really sure what would trigger this sort of increase in aggression. Their routine hasn't changed in the 7 years they've been together.

0,DogAdvice,"Update on my never ending diarrhea German Shepherd ‚Äî poop sample came back CLEAR, vet isn‚Äôt still concerned. Can we talk about stress and if it factors in?","So, my dogs poop sample finally came back, he was completely clear of everything. I don‚Äôt know if they tested got Giardia, but I will have to ask. They just told us to keep monitoring his eating &amp; drinking; if that is not doing well (no appetite, etc) they told us that is a problem and to bring him in. But they did also say we could bring him in next week. 

He acts normally IMO, barks his head off every morning, wants to play, eats &amp; drinks‚Ä¶ I was eating chicken, and he was harassing me for some.

So, I have NO idea what is going on with him, bland diet (chicken and rice) barely helped. 

**IF** there is nothing wrong with him, I‚Äôm wondering IF it‚Äôs stress‚Ä¶

Because I was in a whole different country for a month, my brother, my mom and I. While my sister &amp; other family looked after him (they are as important to him, as we are, btw.)

BUT, what makes me wonder if it‚Äôs stress related, is my sister‚Äôs husband. He‚Äôs not from our country &amp; he visited / met us for the first time.

Our 6 year old Shepherd became OBSESSED with him. Usually he does not give a single care in the world about ANYONE, like at all, especially strangers he didn‚Äôt know as a puppy, but it was insane. He‚Äôd follow my sister‚Äôs husband everywhere. If he left the house, he would pace back &amp; forth, and whimpering, sleep in the room he was staying in and wouldn‚Äôt leave.

Even my sister‚Äôs boyfriend the person he loves the most other than my mom, he didn‚Äôt care about him at all, not even to this extent and we found it bizarre.

So now I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs all stress related cause my sister‚Äôs husband is gone back to the country they live in, OR because there is something internally wrong we haven‚Äôt caught yet.

Thoughts?

Can stress do that much damage (and diarrhea) to a dog?

0,DogAdvice,What should I do?,"Hello y'all. This is my first post and I would like some advice. I currently have 3 dogs at home, all of who are sweet to us. However, each one has their issues and together they just create a huge problem. I have a 2 year old pitbull I've had since he was a puppy, a GSD mix and a mutt (I have no clue what breeds she has in her). Originally I had a samoyed/husky mix who I adored but sadly had to be put down my first week of senior year in college. I was out of state too so I couldn't go back home to say goodbye. It was only him and my pitbull, but since he passed I was left with my pitbull. Fast forward a few months and I return to the state to my pitbull and 2 new dogs.

The thing is, I never explicitly said I wanted the dogs. My pitbull is supposedly my brother's but he refuses to take care of him, so I started to raise him. The mutt showed up about a month after my samoyed passed in our yard and never left so my mom decided to keep her. And the GSD mix was brought home by my dad because I lost my last dog, but I had explicitly told him I did not want another dog.

Now here's the fun part. I am not allowed to keep my dogs inside, so the three of them stay outside. But because I can't spend all my time with them they find stuff to do out of boredom. So my GSD mix and my mutt destroy anything they can, even though they have toys. Just last night, they destroyed the boxes of flooring my dad had bought to put in one of the bedrooms. My pitbull thankfully never gave me the issue of destructive behavior. However, because of my mutt, all three of them go out the yard and chase people. So im stuck running after them and making sure no one gets hurt. I've already been told I need to control my dogs by one of my neighbors and they have already tripped an old man on a bike that passes by my house. I'm scared that someone will get hurt and actually report us. I then have to leave them tied up so I don't have to worry about them going after people when I can't be out there watching them. But I hate having them tied up because I feel like you shouldn't have a dog if all you are going to do is tie them up. That's like buying car and getting insurance for it but never taking it out for a drive. I keep getting yelled at by my dad about the issues that the dogs cause but I told him I never explicitly said i wanted the dogs. I just try to take care of them because I know no one else in the house will. Of course he hit me with the classic, ""tell me when and I'll get rid of them."" I don't know where he would take them, but I'd prefer if I saw where they would end up.

I try to take them on walks, provide them with toys and spend time with them, but I can't be with them 24/7 due to other responsibilities. I know some of their destructive behavior can be stopped with exercise, but walking them is so embarrassing because I can't control the three of them. And whenever I do try to take responsibility I get yelled at, so either way I lose. I should also mention my parents are divorced and live under the same household so im stuck being the messenger/punching bag between my parents and the dogs just make the issue so much worse because my dad brought in one dog he hates, and my mom kept a dog my dad now hates, so I end up in the middle of hearing my parents complain about each other and the issues ""their"" dogs are causing

My solution is to find someone who can take the girls in and keep the pitbull inside. He was a much calmer dog, but ever since the other two came, he like to join in on the chaos. I mentioned I am not allowed to keep my dogs inside. When I had ny samoyed and my pitbull I was allowed to, but now I am not because of the other two. I know they would benefit from having someone who can provide them with the physical and mental stimulation we can't give them. However, my GSD mix has a UTI that needs medical treatment, my mom doesn't want to give up the mutt, and my dad refuses to let any dog inside. So im at a loss.

0,DogAdvice,"My German Shepherd is still having consistent diarrhea despite 2 vet opinions ‚Äî been awaiting a poop sample for several days. Question, would transitioning from Acana to GSD Royal Canin Mix be much better?","My German Shepherd (6 year old) has been having non-stop diarrhea ever since I went on vacation and he was in my families hands. My sister took a photo with his poop being all mucus-y and blood. They took him to two vets, both who weren‚Äôt really concerned about him, gave him a shot ‚Äî and GI food.

We sent for a poop sample, it‚Äôs been a few days; still awaiting the results.

I‚Äôve tried the bland diet (chicken &amp; rice + I‚Äôll ad 12 tbsp of turkey broth) for several days now, maybe about a week. He‚Äôs been obviously starving on it (devours it, but still hungry after.)

His poop was *less* consistent in terms of diarrhea less times a day, instead of doing it more than 3x plus per day. Still mucus-y, and not fully or actual solid.

The last time he was solid was a few weeks ago when I returned to my trip &amp; gave him chicken + rice, it was solid so I‚Äôm not sure why it‚Äôs gone back to diarrhea.

I feel like Acana has been a garbage brand for him, now I‚Äôm hearing about the awful heart issues (or something of sorts?) It‚Äôs been known to cause. He always spits the kibble out too. I‚Äôm thinking of switching him to Royal Canin at some point once I can get stools softer.

0,DogAdvice,Senior dog is scared of new kitten? I'm very worried," So I have a senior pug (Bubba), who is about 15 years old (though he doesn't look or act it). He is my baby and I've had him since he was only a couple months old. But I've been wanting him to have a companion for the longest time. I have been looking into adopting other dogs or cats, but never took the next step because I kept thinking of all the bad things that could happen.

I went out with a friend this weekend, and we decided to stop by petsmart. We always check the adoption area, and that's when I saw the cutest baby. I didn't adopt him immediately, but I couldn't stop thinking about him. I called everyone to try to see if they could convince me not to get him, but they did just the opposite. So yesterday afternoon I went and adopted him. He is a 3 month old muted orange tabby! He is so sweet and affectionate, he won't stop rubbing his nose and cheeks on my face. He is constantly purring and making biscuits too.

But I can't stop worrying about my old pug. He is my world, and I would do anything for him. One of the biggest reasons I never adopted another pet is because I worried that he would feel replaced. I'm so glad that I am taking this chance to find him a companion, but I'm so anxious that it isn't going to work out. The kitten has been with us for the last two days, and today I introduced them because the kitten seemed to be adapting very well. I honestly expected the kitten to be the most nervous, but the kitten was completely fine and actually tried to rub against Bubba. Bubba was actually the one who was scared and nervous! He kept trying to get away from the kitten. He was not aggressive or anything! Just scared and freaked out.

Bubba is slowly going blind and has lost quite a bit of his eyesore already, so I think that is definitely a factor. And he also hasn't really been around cats, only other dogs. He loves other dogs and people, so that's why I though he would love the kitten too! But my hopes are dwindling the more I think about it. I've been told to give it a few more weeks, and I definitely will! But I'm just so worried.

I'm just hoping that some of you may have some suggestions or input on what I should do? Do you think that bubba just needs time to warm up? Should I do anything to help him warm up more? I'm so anxious and worried, I just really want this to work out. I am away from the house nowadays for longer than I'd like, and bubba has some serious separation anxiety. I just want him to have someone other than me to give him the love and attention he deserves. Plead help if you can",Adventurous-Web-4188,2022-11-01,07:03:31,2022,11,1,7,3,Tuesday

0,DogAdvice,Just adopted a reservation puppy &amp; need advice!,"TL;DR: How should I build confidence of our shy reservation dog?

So for some context, we have a 4 year old German Shepard/Husky mix that we adopted from a rescue when she was around 8 weeks. She‚Äôs a great dog, but we failed her in the socialization department as a puppy, and as a result, she is very nervous outside the home. We‚Äôve been wanting to adopt another dog, and we‚Äôre hoping it will help build her confidence as well. 

Yesterday, we adopted a 5 month old male puppy. We don‚Äôt know what he is, but he seems to also have some kind of Shepard. He was found on a Navajo reservation, and it doesn‚Äôt seem like he has spent much time with people. He LOVES our other dog (and she loves him), but he‚Äôs kind of skeptical about us still. He‚Äôs very shy and nervous. 

We don‚Äôt want to make the same mistakes we made with our other dog, so we want to work on socializing him and building his confidence. We also want to make sure he doesn‚Äôt bond too much with our other dog so that he can also build a bond with us. 

What suggestions do you all have for building his confidence, as well as making sure he develops a close bond with us and not just our dog? We understand that raising a Rez dog might be a little different that your average rescue, so any other bits of advice is welcome. Thanks!",selpatstaples,2022-11-01,00:41:23,2022,11,1,0,41,Tuesday
0,DogAdvice,My dog is having somewhat strange behavior at night,"This post is about my 3-4 year old golden retriever who I adopted in February. Her name is Riley and she is the sweetest girl. However for the last week or two she all of sudden has been having some unusual behavior during the night. It‚Äôs not really THAT odd in general, it‚Äôs just odd for her because it‚Äôs completely out of the norm. Usually we have a night routine where as soon as I turn on the shower and start getting ready for bed, she comes into the bedroom and hops on the bed and waits for me to get into bed, and then will cuddle and sleep with me all night. She usually would always stay on the bed all night or maybe move onto the floor. 

In the last week or two it started with her starting to not come in to bed with me, she would stay out on the couch in the living room which is fine. But then after a couple nights of just that she has started waking up during the night and pacing around throughout the living room or kitchen, her nails clacking on the hard wood floors wake me up. Then she will either come running in and jump on my bed and wake me up as if it‚Äôs morning when it‚Äôs like 2-3am, or she will go to the door to be let out. When I let her out she runs into the yard and pees and then runs back in right away, it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs trying to sniff or mess around out there. Usually she would sleep through the night with no issues and wait until I get up in the morning to get up so I‚Äôm just finding her behavior a bit strange lately. 

Do you think this is some type of behavioral issue or could this be a sign of something physical going on? She seems otherwise healthy and normal and I have not had any concerns with her, it‚Äôs just this nighttime behavior that is starting to become a bit odd especially since it just randomly started recently, and is also affecting my sleep at night.

0,DogAdvice,Long lasting diarrhea - Recommendations ?,"Apologizes for the long winded post - I‚Äôm kind of at a loss right now. 

My pup (4 year old wire coat terrier) started having diarrhea out of no where last week (7 days today). It started off with one diarrhea and then a small one and then nothing until the next morning when the same thing repeated. He then didn‚Äôt go at all for a couple days and the vet said it was just solidifying in there and he would be on the mend. 

We had one pretty good poop Thursday and then back to diarrhea. Yesterday was. The worst and today as well. He was going every couple hours through the night and it would be just little squirts of liquid poo. 

I was worried so I took him back to a vet. My regular vet doesn‚Äôt open until 10am so we visited an emergency vet down the street. They did blood work and fecal test which were all fine so we really have no idea what‚Äôs causing this. 


Throughout this week I did the bland diet (chicken and rice) and it stopped working. Was also sprinkling probiotics on there as well with no luck. Pumpkin also didn‚Äôt do much. My vet said a 1/4 tab of immodium could be given to him to help him lose the constant urge to go and it helped for a little but then it didn‚Äôt work at all yesterday night. 

Today we were given purina pro plan EN food as a sample with forti flora powder so I am really hoping that helps. 


Tomorrow we go in for my dogs second round of heartworm treatment - we ruled out that this would cause it since it would be unlikely for any side effects to occur halfway through treatment. 

Lastly - he‚Äôs acting totally normal and still has an appetite. 

I was hoping anyone would be able to provide some insight ? Really struggling here. Thank you!",morewinepleasee,2022-10-31,23:43:25,2022,10,31,23,43,Monday

0,DogAdvice,Older dog picking up bad habits from newer dog,"Pretty much the title. I got a newer, 6yo mutt last year and my older dog, 7yo mutt whose been an angel his whole life, has picked up some habits from the younger one. For example, the younger used to bark at other dogs, people, cars, whatever, but I've trained him out of it. By the time I've trained the younger out of barking, the older now barks at dogs in the dog park or through the fence. I feel like I excused it as the older is becoming an old man due to the fact he don't tolerate a lot of nonsense from younger dogs anymore so I'm not sure if he's barking as a way to communicate his annoyance. 

Recently, I've introduced my dogs to my BIL puppy if 8mo. The younger sniffed and went his own way. The older wasn't interested until the puppy jumped on him and then the humans. The older then started barking at the puppy directly in front of him and physically blocked the puppy from the humans until the puppy calmed down and stopped jumping. I don't think this matters but my older is 55lbs and the size of the smaller Pitts. The puppy is larger than him and is a cane Corso. Then when it was time to go, I opened the car door and my dogs jumped in. The older wouldn't let the puppy in the car until the puppy sat down on the grass first, barking happened when the puppy tried to forces his way into the car. 

The barking happens in dog parks when a dog would try to take his ball or if a dog is being ganged up on. So I guess the question is am I being too sensitive about him barking because he's barking more now and it's actually normal? 


My husband thinks it's normal that he's teaching other dogs manners and that's mainly cause the younger mutt who came to us untrained picked up a lot of cues from the older. But these are other people's dogs and I'm not sure how to go about correcting this.",rukaidai,2022-10-31,20:48:33,2022,10,31,20,48,Monday
0,DogAdvice,Can I leave my Maltipoo alone if I have a 9-5?,"Hello Everyone, 

a friend of mine needs to put his 3 month old Maltipoo puppy up for adoption.

I've been wanting to get a dog for years now but I never had the space for it. Fortunately, a few months ago I moved into a new apartment with a nice outdoors area my dog can run around in. However, I am out of the house for 9 hours a day on average. I read online that I can't leave a dog alone, but I know that some of these websites are exaggerating because lots of people with 9-5 jobs own well behaved dogs. 

My sister lives with me but she's a university student, which means some days she'll have class for 2 hours and other days she might be gone the same period I am. We do have a 2 year old cat that might entertain the pup.   


I did dog sit before, but this will be the first time I actually own a dog. Do you think I should go for the Maltipoo or are there any other dog breeds you could recommend to someone like me?",Hash4120,2022-10-31,20:03:59,2022,10,31,20,3,Monday
0,DogAdvice,My dog is biting her tale and is just depressed all of the sudden and won‚Äôt sleep.,"It kind of happened all of the sudden, she was fine when I got home, running around and wagging her tale. I went to go watch a movie, and she couldn‚Äôt sit still, she would bite and nip at her tale and she was kind of just letting her tale hang there, when she would walk it would just sway like a limp noodle. It‚Äôs currently 3:00am and won‚Äôt sleep. She could just have an upset stomach, but who knows. I‚Äôve also taken her out to the bathroom multiple times and she pooped but is still acting this way. Any advice?",ReaperGrin,2022-10-31,18:01:05,2022,10,31,18,1,Monday
0,DogAdvice,My 8 month old female Jack Russell has a metallic smell coming from her bum,"Hello, please help because my vet wants to charge 850 dollars just to exam and insurance won‚Äôt cover it.

I realize this is probably coming from her anal glands, but I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this? I‚Äôve always had boy JRTs and she‚Äôs my first female. I always thought the anal gland smell was fishy, but (I think) hers are extremely metallic. She is fixed so I know it‚Äôs not her menstrual cycle, but maybe I am wrong and she is bleeding abnormally. A couple of days ago, I noticed a brownish spot on the pillow she was sleeping on. The smell is like blood but as if it were mixed with something else, I don‚Äôt know how to explain it. Tonight, she was sleeping on my lap and there was a spot on my shorts, same thing as the other night. Are her anal glands possibly infected? Am I being a helicopter parent?


On an unrelated note (possibly), she has been throwing up a lot this week. She had diarrhea on Tuesday and Thursday during the night while throwing up as well. We had to rush to the ER on Friday at 4am because she was trying to throw up and collapsed on the floor and couldn‚Äôt move. When we got to the ER, it‚Äôs like nothing happened. Vitals were normal; BP, HR, and temp were all good. Her energy has been totally fine too. I am so lost on what is going on with her. She doesn‚Äôt take any medications, I‚Äôve always cooked her food, and she doesn‚Äôt really eat things off the ground. 

LAST THING I PROMISE

I have 2 different neighbors who also have dogs. We live in a small complex and there‚Äôs only so many spots dogs can do their business. Their dogs also just happened to be sick this week. Same symptoms for the most part; diarrhea and vomiting. Is it possible the HOA sprayed something that is making all of our dogs sick? 

Lol sorry for word vomit, but please help.",aQuarterChub,2022-10-31,16:07:34,2022,10,31,16,7,Monday

0,DogAdvice,Sudden aggression,Two of my dogs who have been together for roughly 7 years at least have been having troubles. About a week ago the runt or less dominant one started getting very aggressive. Growling and barking at the other one as well as outright attacking the other one if there's nothing seperating them. As far as I know it is out of left field and just an hour ago the newly aggressive dog drew blood out of the other dog. She doesn't attack us but only the other dog and is a pretty docile lap dog otherwise. What would cause this sudden change and is the a way to deal with it or is it time to permanently separate them? I have had dogs in my life as far back as I can remember and have never seen this happen before.,Miserable_Mess_990,2022-10-31,13:41:42,2022,10,31,13,41,Monday
