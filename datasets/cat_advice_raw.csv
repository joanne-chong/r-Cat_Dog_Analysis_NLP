The best they could do would be running $300 of tests just to figure out where to start and even then we were warned that it likely wouldn't be treatable given his symptoms. One of us was just laid off unexpectedly and the last of our cash went to the exam/meds he got yesterday. The cheapest euthanasia price I've found calling around is still $100 we don't have.

One of our cats we've had for a couple of years, since kittenhood. He came to us from a rescue and generally has a lot of obsessive and anxiety driven behaviours due to what he went through before he came home to us. 
We've been pulling our hair out trying to help him while seeing our house getting destroyed around us. He didn't want to be alone but didn't want to be picked up. He destroyed sections of the carpet, the walls, attacked the other cats and was a right devil, especially at night. He can't stand closed doors and started opening them to wreak havoc in every room he could. 
He's been to the vet, we've bought feliway diffusers, cat trees, toys galore, tried natural drops like pet rescue remedy and played with him whenever we were home but nothing was working.
We were stressed to the point of tears and had made up our minds to rehome him when I found our dogs old crate in the garage. It's big enough for a large breed dog and he used to get in and out of it before we packed it away.
I pulled it out, gave it a clean and the whole time our cat was watching me. I grabbed his bed, his blanket and some of his favorite toys to put in there and he just walked right in. I left the door open so he could walk in and out as he pleased for the rest of the afternoon. Dinner time came and usually he's obsessed with running around to everyone's food or trying to get through the door while he's being fed separately so I put his bowl in the crate and shut the door while he ate. No yowling, no protesting and when he was done, he got in his bed and went to sleep. So we left him there while we watched a movie and he just kept sleeping. 
We trialled him in there overnight and I checked on him a few times throughout the night and he was still calm, mostly sleeping or playing with his toy mouse. 
Come morning, he's still chill when my alarm goes off. I open the door, he wanders down to the litterbox and from then on he's been a calmer cat.
He's got his routine, where he'll eat breakfast and dinner in there, come out for cuddles and some playtime after dinner and goes to bed about 9.30pm. He waits patiently in the morning and wanders out when I open the door. He is much calmer throughout the day with the other cats and we've not seen any new destruction happening.
He is not in there 24/7, only overnight, and he seems to benefit from having a space that is purely his own that the other cats are not allowed in. He seems able to fully relax in there and has become much cuddlier and calmer and it feels like the light at the end of the tunnel.",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,119545,public,self,We may have found our solution,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/z9w5ax/we_may_have_found_our_solution/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

For a little backstory, we have two bonded brothers that we adopted at two months old. They are about 10 months old now, and super rambunctious and love to chase each other around all day. My partner doesn’t mind them, but he finds it absolutely repulsive when they climb on our counter tops and tables. I understand his frustration, it’s not a great habit they have but no matter what we do they don’t stop. We clean and sanitize the stove and countertops frequently but they will still jump on them so long as our backs are turned to them and sometimes they’ll even do it in front of our faces. They know they’re not supposed to be on them, the second we catch eyes with them they jump off and run away. We’ve tried everything. Tin foil, tape, compressed air, spraying bottles, nothing works. The last straw was just a few days ago, somehow they managed to climb onto our floating shelves in the kitchen and knock over glass containers and it caused them to shatter and it made a mess. My partner works from home so it was extremely disruptive and he had to take time out of his work day to clean it up. Again, I don’t want to rehome them, I would never wish that on any pet, but my partner is getting increasingly frustrated regarding this and unfortunately he’s not as sympathetic as I am. I’ve considered the possibility that maybe they will be better off in someone else’s home but I don’t know. I’ve had many cats growing up but i’ve never had to deal with behavior this bad.

When he arrived in our home, he did some pretty innocent exploring, testing the waters, and we quickly noticed what we needed to watch for with him. Plant and cable chewing were big ones.

So after some cable wrapping and hiding, as well as plant reorganization and some anti-chew spray, as well as getting him some cat grass, it's stopped for the most part. 

However he seems to be getting into moods (not zoomies, he's adjusted well to our 2-3 play sessions per day) where he will jump onto areas we've tried to barricade, or make inaccessible, for reasons of wires that can't be moved any more, or plants that could make him sick. A loud clap and a firm ""no"" used to be enough, but now he almost just gives me a look of ""that's nice, dad"" and carries on, so we gradually progress. we did get one of those motion air sprayers to guard a hub of wires and my girlfriend exotic (and toxic...) plant, which works very well, but I also don't have $400 to buy enough to create a perimeter around everything lol. The big no areas will get him a clap and ""no"", then a quick spray from the bottle, and a final offence gets him a timeout (this is after we noticed it wouldn't matter how many times we tell him to stop, so we went from 4 strikes, to just those 3 steps). His timeout room is our spare bathroom with his second litter box, toys, water and bed, with nothing that can get him into trouble, he is exiled there for 15 minutes. The timeout seems to calm him down, as he generally goes to him toys, curls up with us on the couch, or back to his cat tree to watch the outside.

Are we going about this the right way? We've tried to foil on the floor around areas he's not allowed in, but I guess he's one out of 100 cats that doesn't mind tin foil... Lucky me right? Cat blocker spray works for 2 days, but ideally I'd like a solution that teaches him long term to not go there. It's gradually bothering us, as he's accidentally knocked over a plant, a lamp, and some decorations (we know it's accidentally as it's just him trying to squeeze into small spaces, or get by stuff, not pawing things off shelves).

Traveling with cats is very fraught, and something I thought about for months. Your situation and cat(s) are of course different, but I want to share my experience in case it is helpful.

I have a single, six month spayed kitten (context: she was found at three months old on the street by herself. The shelter was full, so they asked me to foster her. I fostered her for 3.5 weeks, and fell in love. Due to my apartment size and costs, I cannot swing another cat, and she was not bonded to any. I adopted her because she is incredibly independent, friendly, and loving. I play with her at least 1-2 hours a day and am deeply committed to her well-belong).

Anyway. Before I adopted her, I booked a trip for 12 days for Thanksgiving. At first I thought I would hire a pet sitter from a certified/bonded company to visit her twice a day. I arranged for the pet sitter to meet her and visit her on another occasion when I was out for 12 hours.. But the more time went on, the more anxious and uncomfortable I grew leaving her alone for this long. I work from home and spend most days with her. I couldn’t imagine going from zero days apart to twelve.

While traveling might be uncomfortable, the level of anxiety I was feeling about leaving her meant that I would be unable to enjoy my trip to see my family if I were constantly worried about her. I have PetCams in every room, and still, the uncertainty was too much for me to quell.

Before making the decision, I took her to the vet who said she is 100% able to fly health-wise. He said it’s a “headache” to travel with pets, but we don’t know how she’d behave if left mostly alone that long, and suggested I don’t give her free reign of the house. He also said we don’t know how she’d behave in a new environment! There are a lot of objective facts, circumstances, and emotions that factored into my decision to bring her (eg, she never cries in the carrier when we go for a car ride). 

The vet suggested Composure Pro chews, which we tested beforehand, and she wouldn’t eat. I got a Pupteck harness and practiced putting it on and letting her wear it around the house a few times beginning several weeks beforehand. I also set up an AirTag to put on the harness for additional peace of mind. Her Sherpa medium sized, airline-approved carrier stays out where she can see it 24/7, and I sprayed it (and my car) with Feliway, and put in an old t-shirt and some of her toys. 

On my end, I made sure to book the $125/each way pet in cabin ticket beforehand. I also got approved for TSA Pre-Check, which was the best $78 I ever spent. It took literally two seconds to go through TSA, and I got to the airport with plenty of time to ask for a private screening room, which took all of 1 minute. I also flew on non-peak days (Thursday and Tuesday). 

At the destination we were visiting, my parents generously set up a cat hammock, beautiful cat tree, her same water fountain, scratching post, litter box, and toys. The space we’d be staying in is two bedrooms with a bathroom in between. This would be her safe space. In this space, there is plenty of room for her to run around, hide, and a large window with awesome Cat TV and plenty of Floridian lizards to watch all day…. I also plugged in a Feliway diffuser.

Going there, we found a quiet spot in the airport and she slept until it was time to board. I will say, being in line to board stressed her out, but when I pivoted the carrier to face me (instead of all the people), she calmed down. We had a window seat, which was wonderful - she essentially faced the wall, and stuck her nose against my feet (she loves the smell of feet, haha), and slept the entire way. I’d check on her every once in a while by saying her name, and she’d meow back.

When we got to the new location, she went under the bed for a few hours. I lifted up the bed skirt to check on her and she stretched out her paw and came out, sniffing around with her belly low to the ground. She slept on the bed next to me the first night, which she never does at home… The next day, she was exploring, playing, eating, using the litter box, and posting up in her cat tree to stare out the window. She got spooked by some new sounds the first few days, but eventually got used to it. 

After about five days, we let her roam supervised through the rest of the house for a bit. There is a puppy that stayed separated by a baby gate. They got to the point where they were sniffing each others’ noses through the gate!

Our trip home was also smooth. The minute we got home, she demanded a rigorous play session! While we played on the trip, she wasn’t sprinting around as much. Back home, her play mojo came out in full throttle immediately!

TLDR: I traveled with my kitten to ensure she received the level of care and attention she is used to on a daily basis. Without any medication, she slept on the plane, and was sniffing around the new room a couple hours after arriving. In the new location, she was enthralled with her new Cat TV and had a very comfortable setup with all of her same items from home: the space was sufficiently catified! I know people say cats are better off at home, but given that she is still young and I was anxious about leaving her for 12 days for the first time, I wanted to try it out and see how adaptable she is. To me, the answer is very!

I've got a 2 year old male cat, neutered, GPS tracked, fed dry food and wet Whiskas twice a day at 8am/8pm roughly. 

He's got a catflap that's always unlocked but he usually goes out only after dark, and returns at 5-6am.

He's always been a hunter, bringing home a dead mouse about once or twice a week but lately it's really ramped up, and he's stopped killing them! Last night I got a dead one at 6pm, a live one about an hour later which I caught after much difficulty and then another live vole at 11pm which is still at large. It usually about 2 or 3 a night now, his record is 5.

The night before that he literally stuck his head through the catflap at 10pm, released a live mouse and buggered off. That mouse is now somewhere in the walls. And last week, he put the back half of a mouse in the side pocket of my backpack, and then the day after I found a half dead chewed vole in my bag.

I can usually tell when he's got something as he wakes me up making a weird growling sound whilst holding the rodent, it happens at all hours. 

I live on a small boat so when he's kept inside, he gets bitey, angry, loses all affection and doesn't want to play or anything.

English it's not my first language, apologies in advance for any mistakes, also I am in my phone in case of formatting issues. 
Me and my boyfriend have a year old calico, we are collegue students and we are each returning home for the holidays, my family lives much farther than his (around 30 hours of driving versus 8 hours), so it wouldn't make any sense for me to take her in a plane and also my family has another cat and that could cause trouble. 
My boyfriend can take her with him. Should he do that or should we hire a catsitter to come and take care and see her for a few hours? We have no friends that can take her.
I have been reading about this and I've seen that spending so much time only seeing a stranger a few hours a day may change her personality and traumatize her, but I've also read that travelling and a new place it's traumatizing even with a familiar face taking care of her.

I have never posted before so please excuse any issues.

I have two cats, Benji (4) and Luigi (1ish). Benji arrived last September. He has always been very clingy and attentive. He follows me around, will cry if I shut the bathroom door etc. He loves me a lot and is my little shadow.

Luigi was originally a foster, but he got along great with Benji and I felt really helped him feel less anxious. I have had him since early June. He is very cuddly, loves to be as close to you as possible. Unlike Benji he isn’t always so loving. He is independent and comes to me when he wants it.

Recently, I’ve noticed Benji being more aggressive with Luigi. Typically Benji will let him know if he’s being annoying and will hiss to let him know to leave him alone. 

For the last few weeks, if Benji sees Luigi laying with me or whatnot he gets upset. The other day Benji jumped and hissed at him as he was laying on me. This morning I woke up and Luigi was again beside me, snuggled up on my side. As soon as Benji realized he ran at him. Luigi immediately got up and ran.

There hasn’t been any major changes. We moved in August but they have plenty of space to play.  I’m not sure what I can do to stop this. I obviously love them both and want to give them what they need but I have never seen Benji get angry like he has been.

Great cat, love her to death.  Very friendly and very well behaved.  Doesn't get on counters/tables, doesn't claw furniture.

My issue is, she is *overly* needy.  I thought as the months went by since her adoption she would start to get a little better, but she's actually gotten worse.  

I WFH and it is a non-stop fight all day long to stop her from sitting on my desk in front of my screen.  Eight hours, all day long.  I got her a cat tower and put it directly next to my desk.  She will lay in it maybe 20% of the time.  

I will pick her up from my desk, put her on the tower, and literally the second I let go she is trying to walk back on the desk.  We will repeat this 6-10 times, before she finally hisses and jumps to the floor.  I then get about a fifteen minute break before the whole process repeats itself.  For eight fucking hours.  

I make sure to play with her for 20-30 minutes before I start work, again in the middle of the day, and again after work.  

She will *not* self play or entertain herself in any way shape or form.  I have about ten different types of toys she can interact with on her own, and she won't touch a single one.  I have a window perch for her looking into the front yard, she refuses to sit in it (I've never seen her look out any window in the house for the five months I've had her).  

She is affecting my sleep, waking me up 3-5 times per night licking my face and meowing.  

If she is not sleeping herself (and she sleeps way less than most cats) she demanding my attention 100% of the time.  


FYI she's had *two* full work ups at the vet since I got her, she is not sick in anyway.  


Despite my complaining here, I absolutely *do* love her to death, but she is also slowly driving me crazy.

I made a post recently about adopting a Tomcat from the streets. Midnight is his adoption name.

Here's a bit of back story on my dear Midnight boy:

He's a 1 yo cat that one of the tennants in my appartment complex adopted, let out and never really brought back in. He's not entirely feral as he was born in a house (one of his sister is living with a tennant who knew the person caring for Mama and her litter) but he obviously has some ""feral habits"". The introduction with my in home boys went well (this is what my first post about him was but I was under an other username bc too lazy to match pc and phone, anyway) and they're all living well together although his ""feral habits"" can sometimes trigger one of them. They don't fight much but a little disagreement happens every once in a while. 

On to the problem:

Since I've had him, I'm not opening the windows as much for him to smell all the smell from the great outdoors and I think it might be the problem. I have a harness and walk him when I can and the weather allows it, when I don't have time to do so, I harness him up and tie his leash to the indoor doorknob and let him out on the balcony until he asks to be let in again. I had the idea to do so because he satrted meowing and yowling all the time for no apparent reason. Some times he'll even be doing that meowing and yowling while he drinks at the fountain, which is quite funny to hear his ""MleowmlmlmlleoooOOww!!"" and stuff but I'm getting worried.

Letting him outside and walking him around the block doesn't seem to fix his constant crying, no matter how much attention I give him or how many times I let him out during the day. The only time he's being quiet is when he is touching me or sleeping in my general vincinity. Then he'll mrrp, trill, purr and ask for pets. As soon as he gets up and walks away though, the song of his people starts again and doesn't end until he comes back, close to me. He also seems possessive of me. When he's chilling near me and one of my other cat wants in, he growls and gets annoyed even if they don't touch him but he doesn't attack them. He just... growls and leave if he's too annoyed.

Sorry this is longer than I wanted it to be and there's a lot of info but I don't know what this could be about and I'm really at a loss here. I've had 3 Toms in my life and never was confronted to that behavior before. Two factors I think might be the cause for his current behavior is 1 - I am a woman, and 2 - I got my period yesterday. My older Tom (Lilboi) never acted like this. I will have them neutered soon, I only need to scrape enough money to make sure I can handle the aftercare too.

I guess my question is: Should I be worried there is an underlying health problem although he eats well and is getting adjusted to the schedule, drinks well and still uses the litterboxes correctly? Or is it only sonething he does and I'm overthinking this because of adoption regret/guilt??  @_@???? T_T

From all my visual inspections of his little person, I can't see anything wrong. Also whenever I pet him I sorta palpate his body to make sure there's no lumps or scabs or anything weird anywhere... He also seems so generally much more content and happy since he understood that he's got a roof above his head then when I first got him. I am such at a loss with this situation. I love him so much but it's annoying when he starts yowling non-stop during the night.",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,119414,public,self,Tomcat crying and yowling all the time.

I got it from a place, where it had spent its short life with other kittens and cats. There was this elderly woman that was taking care of all of them. She showed us how to groom it, clean the tear drops beneath the eyes and what food to feed it. All was clear. However, while she was grooming it with a stainless double-sided comb, I felt instantaneously anxious since it started meowing. 

Let me briefly introduce you what I have done so far:

1. Brought it home and immediately left it in the bathroom for 15 minutes while I was driving my friend back to his place. ( He came with me to the place where we got the kitten from)
2. Came back home, put two bowls - one filled with water, the other with dry food (Royal Canin for Persian cats; I mistakenly got the one for adults) + put the litter box (silicone balls) - that was all put in the bathroom.
3. 2.5-3hrs later I opened the bathroom door and started talking gently to the kitty. It was still in the corner of the bathroom. Then I left it there for another 30 minutes.
4. Came back to the bathroom when again started gently talking to the kitty and after 2-3 minutes I slowly dragged it out of the corner and got it with me.
5. Went to the living room and laid on the couch, I put it on my chest and started slowly petting it while keeping gently talking 'We are friends, we wish no harm to each other...', it tried to escape a couple of times but I kept on petting it.
6. 3-4 minutes later I left it explore the apartment. 30 minutes later, it started slowly approaching me, until it got snugged itself between me and the couch pillow.
7. My girlfriend came home and felt like the whole story was starting from the beginning.
8. Fast forward, it ate a bit of the fresh wet food for Persian cats, then we went to bed. It took him 30-60 minutes to get accustomed to us and started slowly approaching us in bed. At the end, it slept by my head.
9. In the morning, it was cuddling with me. Now I went to the pet store to buy a double-sided comb and lotion for tear cleaning. Came back - it spent the 5 hours since I left the morning bed in the bed by itself. I was busy working at home.
10. I tried to slowly approach him, gently talking so I can get him and start combing and perhaps get the opportunity to clean beneath the eyes. Nope... it jumped off the bed and hissed at me.

First time hissing me...

It feels it doesn't eat enough, and I haven't seen any traces of urine or fecal in any of the rooms nor the litter box. It has been 24 hours since his new home.

I am kind of anxious, should I be more confident and get him no matter what so I can comb him and clean eyes or I should leave him be so he can fully accustomed to us for the next couple of days, while keeping an eye if he is eating and defecating?

Saturday I'm going to give a home to a sweet two months and a half kitten, and it will be my first pet. I've been reading a lot these days to prepare myself as better as possible, I bought everything needed, but I still have some doubts on how and what to do during the first hours/days. 
I have many questions so I will just do a list:

1) I'll have to travel two hours by car to get the kitten. I will bring with me a carrier with a blanket inside (maybe some small toys too?), I'll spray Feliway Classic 15 minutes before putting the kitten inside. Should I bring anything else? Food maybe? Water? Tips on how to put the kitten in the carrier for the first time? 
I also heard that covering the carrier with a blanket during the travel might help her feel more calm because of the darkness, is that right? 

2) Once home, should I let him roam freely at his own pace, or start by closing ourselves in a room and just chill there for the first day? I think the second option might be better and I was thinking to do so in my bedroom, bringing everything he might need (bowls for food/water, carrier, litter box) in my room temporarily. 
But I also heard that moving the litter box is not a good idea because the kitten might get confused and not be able to find it. Is this a concern? I will leave the litter box in a not crowded hallway, not in my bedroom, so I would definitely move it, if I choose to keep him closed in my room for the first hours.
Any other tips for the first 24 hours would definitely help.

3) Should I try to get him to the vet asap, or let him adjust to his new home first? I wanna be sure he's 100% fine but I also don't want to traumatize him with another ride in the carrier to the vet😢

4) Tips for playing with her? I bought some toys, but how can I entertain him for hours with the same toys? Won't he get bored after a while? I heard kittens need many hours of playtime to avoid zoomies so I wanna help her as much as possible.

Any tips helps guys, I want to make her feel as comfortable as possible🥺

We brought home a new female kitten to our home with a 4 year old male cat nearly 3 weeks ago. We kept them separated for the first few days and did scent swapping ect (although reading more into it now perhaps we should have done it longer). From first meeting they were both wary and tried to swat each other. 

We did lots of supervised play dates where they mostly chase each other, taking turns, but it still looks a bit aggressive to me. The older cat wouldn’t take his eyes off her when she was in the room or chill out. I separated them if the kitten ever made any noises she was hurt, or try to play with the kitten to distract from getting to this point. The thing is, they seem to wind each other up and if one of them stops pouncing and chasing the other one will start.

I thought we had a bit of a breakthrough last night, in the evening they were both asleep at the end of my bed for a while. Then later on, my partner accidentally left the kitten out of her safe room last night and they both slept on  our bed all night. However, this morning they were back chasing and fighting and the adult cat pinned the kitten down and she squeaked. 

I’m really unsure if they are starting to get on at all, or we need to start the process all over again. They don’t seem particularly phased from the fights and kitten seems to go back for more (she often winds up resident cat when he wants to chill), but I don’t want to risk them never coexisting.

I feel that we are in over our heads and I don’t know what to do. They tore the entire bottoms out of our brand new couches to climb inside and they use them as a scratching post despite having several actual scratching posts and cat towers around the house. We constantly brush them and vacuum the house but I feel like our house is coated in fur and so disgusting that I can’t invite anyone over. We have cat proofed EVERYTHING. We don’t have curtains because they would tear those up trying to get into the window. They’ve tore up so many of our blinds we just have to leave them up. We rigged a baby gate in front of the stairs because they love to rip the carpet off of the stairs. We can’t have any decorations or leave anything out without them getting knocked to the floor or chewed up. We’ve had to replace expensive appliances due to them chewing up cords. We’ve tried to do the bitter cat spray and that doesn’t work. They have tons of toys and we play with them with laser pointers and such. 
Aside from this they are great cats. The younger cat is super sweet and doesn’t know a stranger and even tries to play with our friend’s dog. The older cat is super attached to me and hides from anyone else. They are both sweethearts and never bite/scratch/hiss at us. I’m just at the point where I don’t feel comfortable in my own home and it’s like I have to accommodate every single thing I do to their behavior. My mom wants a cat so I thought about letting her have the younger one. But I worry about the cat who is attached to me and he is used to having the other cat around as well.

My cat Rogue is 13 y/o spayed female. She has never peed anywhere but her litterbox except the time she had crystals in her bladder (that was when she was about 3, she's been on special food ever since). She has recently started peeing a little bit in her water bowl once or twice a day. There have been no changes in the house/food/litter/anything, she just started doing it one day. I assumed it was because she had a UTI or something, so the first thing I did was to take her to the vet for a complete checkup, bloodwork, and urine analysis. She's perfectly healthy. 

She's always been a weird water cat, she likes to be in the shower and bathed, and she splashes in the water bowl CONSTANTLY. We have a huge rubber mat the size of a large towel with towels under it and on top of it to keep the floor dry, and have to replace the towels every other day or so and change the water multiple times a day because she also uses the water bowl to clean litter off her feet that gets stuck on her feet because her feet are almost always slightly damp from splashing in the water. It's really annoying, but I love her and if that's what makes her happy, whatever. The bowl used to be a large one because she shared it with the dog, and she would sit in the water and wash herself.

Then she started peeing in it a little every day. She still goes in her litterbox mostly, she's not primarily using the water to use the bathroom. Her litterbox is regularly cleaned and I haven't moved it or changed types of litter. I moved the large water bowl to the shower and she LOVES it there because I turn the shower on to refill the water bowl and she can stick her head under the running water as her bowl fills. I also fill it up even more than usual because it doesn't matter how much she splashes in there. She drinks from it but will also still sit in it and pee. The dog doesn't go in there so this water is 100% hers so I don't think it's a territorial thing. For the dog's water, we replaced it with a smaller bowl that she can't sit in so we figured she wouldn't pee in it if she can't sit in it. But no, she just squats over it and pees a little. 

We recently went on a trip and although I thoroughly explained the new situation to the pet sitter, the sitter decided to move the dog's water to the rug by his bed. Rogue of course peed and splashed in the water and it got all over the rug. The floor under the rug has a bit of water damage now and the rug is trash. 

I've tried getting her water fountains in the past, it only makes a mess because she will still splash and play in it. I haven't tried it since she's started peeing in the water bowls, but I think she will either just find a way to pee in it or just splash in it and continue to pee in the other water bowls. We can't put the dog's water anywhere she can't get to, so that's not an option either. The dog doesn't seem to care about the pee and will just drink it anyway, so we have to constantly monitor the water situation because it can't be good for him to drink piss water. 

This is getting ridiculous and it's stressing both me and my fiance out a lot. He suggested posting and asking for ""some Jackson Galaxy shit"" that we might not have thought of. I really hope someone has some advice because this is getting seriously annoying and I've run out of ideas.

The only thing I’m concerned about is that my mom goes to work every weekday for around eight hours, and every other week I’m gone for around five days. 

This means that for at least twice a month she’s alone in our house for around eight hours at a time. I’ve heard online that you aren’t supposed to leave kittens under four months of age alone for that long, but none of those sites go into detail about what would actually happens if you do this, so I’m worried about leaving her alone for that long. 

I’ve thought about having friends come check on her while I’m gone but I don’t think anyone would be willing to do this so I’m not sure what to do or if I might be overreacting.

I've always had pets, but she was the hardest cat I've ever had. Her condition required 2 medications daily that couldn't be missed by even an hour. She was so aggressive ( was a stray before ) at the vet any little thing required full sedation, often even two times the normal amount. She was extremely destructive to the point where we had cameras with motion detection all over our apartment ( also due to her condition). Basically for the last year she worsened I've been in a constant state of worry.at the same time , she also had wonderful qualities like sleeping through the night and understanding not to scratch furniture.  I don't regret a second of it, but here is my problem : I am terrified of getting a new cat(s) because I don't even remember what it's like to not be constantly worried and scared about them. Yes, they will have their own issues but it can't be like she was. Yet I am afraid I'll never be ready to get another because of the intense fear I have of them causing me this anxiety  .

The only thing I’m concerned about is that my mom goes to work every weekday for around eight hours, and every other week I’m gone for around five days. 

This means that for at least twice a month she’s alone in our house for around eight hours at a time. I’ve heard online that you aren’t supposed to leave kittens under four months of age alone for that long, but none of those sites go into detail about what would actually happens if you do this, so I’m worried about leaving her alone for that long. 

I’ve thought about having friends come check on her while I’m gone but I don’t think anyone would be willing to do this so I’m not sure what to do or if I might be overreacting. 

She has a dog there who she can play with from time to time so that might help, but I would love some insight into this if you guys can.

She was extremely destructive to the point where we had cameras with motion detection all over our apartment ( also due to her condition).

Today she’s been hiding under the coat rack. Doing the same thing. She’ll only come out to meow for food or use her litter and then quickly back under the coat rack. When I pull her out and hold her she purrs, is comfortable and falls asleep but as soon as I put her down she tries to hide.

i adopted my tortie a year and a half ago from a shelter that said she would do best as a single cat. it was love at first sight and i have done my best to give her everything she could possibly want - i've kept an eye on her health (she's got some upper respiratory issues) and i've showered her in toys and playtime! she is the star of the household, and when i'm not playing with her and she's not sleeping, my mother's giving her lots of attention and letting her chase her tape measure/fabric scraps while she sews. basically: kahlua is spoiled and we wouldn't have it any other way.

recently, though, all of the playtime we've been giving her hasn't been enough. i've come downstairs to find the little wand toys she loves so much pulled out of the storage spot i've put them in and broken in half - she apparently taught herself how to use them on her own, but they couldn't handle her strength. she's been hopping on my mother's dresser, which she never used to do, and knocking over the ironing board in my mom's room. i've tried playing with her more, but at this rate, that's the only thing i would be able to do all day - and while i would love to do that for her, i do have other responsibilities.

i know cats are social animals, and i also know kahlua is very, very attached to me. if i'm out of the house for more than an hour, i get a lecture when i get home, and she doesn't leave my side for a few hours until she's sure i'm home for the rest of the night. so i've been thinking about maybe adopting another cat from a rescue - maybe on the younger side, since she did have kittens before i adopted her - to give her a companion when i can't devote all my attention to her. would this possibly help her feel more fulfilled? if i was told she would be best in a one-cat household, would that still hold true all this time later? if i do get another cat, should it be a younger one or one that's older than her? i don't want to adopt a cat and have to rehome it shortly afterwards - that's not fair to the other kitty. i want to get through this with as little harm as possible done to all cats involved.

By dirty, I mean FILTHY. Unrelated to the car situation, she leaves dishes in the sink for months, leaves her crap all around the apartment, and does not seem to feel at all ashamed when I have to call her out on these things. Her room is her personal space, yes, but when I say filthy, words cannot even begging to describe her room. We’ve had roach issues in the past, yet she has done nothing to help quell the situation. I hate to be that person that calls people out, but my other roommate is so sweet and also doesn’t speak English well, so she doesn’t communicate with this roommate. 

Now that you all have gotten the gist of how this girl generally lives, let me explain the situation. My cat is fed twice a day, once in the morning before I go to work and once at night. My roommates cat always hovers around at feeding time, and if I close the door he literally will destroy the door (has in the past); as a result, he ends up eating at least half of her food. This causes a lot of stress for me and my cat; I can tell that my cat is anxious about food all of the time, and feels rushed to eat, while I just worry if I’m feeding her enough since I’m not home a lot. I left for break this past weekend, and I filled up a bowl with at least eight servings of food, and moved it downstairs (my roommates cat avoids leaving the top floor). My other roommate that was helping me take care of my cat while I was gone told me that her food bowl was empty, not even at the end of the day. Todo literally ate ALL of the food in less than a day. Like….. I’m living paycheck to paycheck. If I could afford two cats, I would have another cat. Anyways, this is the same situation with the litter. I’ve been wondering why her litter box has been filling up so fast…. Come to find out that my roommates cats litter box is rarely cleaned. I’ve been going through so much of it it’s insane. I also found out that my roommate doesn’t even have water/food bowls set out for her cat…. she’s just been giving him cans of food (even though he’s clearly food obsessed and should be fed more than once a day). Why even have a cat at that point. 

What do I do about this situation? I’ve tried spraying him with water, but as a lot of you know, that doesn’t work at all, it just temporarily deters him. My roommate hasn’t been perceptive to my polite requests in the past, so I doubt she’ll be receptive to me basically telling her to take better care of her cat. I myself struggle to keep up with ONE cat with my hectic schedule, so I feel like it’s unfair that I’m literally taking care of her cat as well. 

TLDR; I’m broke, living with two other roommates, my one roommates cat is using up all that I buy for my cat. My roommate is not very clean or organized, and she’s the same way with her cat. How do I approach the situation, knowing that my roommate doesn’t really care and isn’t a considerate person?

My next door neighbours cat basically won’t leave me alone? Every time I go outside into the garden it’s there, and when I try to go back into the house it sits by my back door and meows to come in, I have to basically open the door slightly and jump in, otherwise it will come in with me. It then sits by the door meowing and scratching the door. It’s now progressed to sitting on the window ledge, to the point where we can’t open the window or the door in summer as it will come in.

The cat is very well looked after by my neighbour, she has a collar and is well groomed and well fed. My neighbour loves her very much basically.

Is there anything we can do to stop this? It’s kind of getting on our nerves? Please don’t suggest that the cat is ours now, and we should take him. I’m allergic, and my dad has OCD. We’re really not in the position to have a cat 😂.

Cat A - ~8 years old, fixed, some anxiety issues and a Bottle Brat so can be aggressive at times.  Declawed (not by us).

Cat B - ~4 years old, fixed, sweet and gentle with people but very playful and gets the zoomies a lot, and has shown some nervousness and aggression with cat A but seems calm now.

It’s been 5 months since B came to the house and we are still having to juggle the two.  They get to other sides of glass doors or screens where they are separated and just kind of stare at each other.  They seem curious about each other so long as there is some kind of force field between them, but ready to jump each other when there isn’t.  We were going to try to introduce them this evening, but A was having a day and was overtly aggressive with us so we nixed it.

We don’t know where to go from here.  Right now they are still isolated from each other and we don’t know how to transition from keeping them separated to commingling without there being WW3.  They aren’t really food motivated so the feeding and treats on either side of the door isn’t really working.

Yesterday my sweet daughter had to move in for a week because the appartement has to be renovated. She brought her two cats and one doggie. This we found the best solution for her having autism and we don’t want the pets to be in a shelter, especially because of hers are rescues. 

I have four cats and a golden retriever. The vet already gave me a week amount alprazolam for the retriever because of him being hyper-hyper-hyper and even didn’t want to breath normal or rest. Her doggie is calm though but snapped a few times at my hyper pancake. 

Three cats are veeeerry upset. Three of mine are ok with it (calm characters), one of mine is hiding and growling. Both of my daughters are growling. Last night I heard one biiig scream. A few things are broken by now by running away from each other. 

I have an extra litter box. I sprayed feromones. There is constant supervision the whole week except when we sleep. I put extra water and food on an extra different place. We are acting calm and all of us grew up with cats and dogs knowing their language. 

Fellows, do you have any tips for us? What can we do to remain calmness?

Already neutered, up to date shots, clean bill of health. Brought him home on Saturday. Absolute cuddle bug and hates being separated from people. This is our first time introducing cats.

Resident cat (RC) is a 12 year old female, spayed. She was adopted with another cat (sadly, passed away last year) back in 2010. She's very bonded to me; she only goes to my wife when I'm not arround.

We're doing a modified introduction plan - I work nights and RC spends the day sleeping with me in the bedroom; during this time NK is allowed out to explore.

Quick breakdown of the days so far:

Day 1:
RC growling and hissing when she saw (he got out once by accident) or smelled NK, and on edge. During the accudental meeting, lots of hissing and staring from RC, but no outward aggression and RC ended up fleeing. NK just stared back with no noise.

Day 2:
We gave NK a bath to get the shelter smell off him (read that elsewhere). RC would growl if she smelled NK on me, but was more curiius about his scent elsewhere (lots if sniffing, no noise). RC would approach NK's door with caution and stop about 5 feet away, eventually getting spooked and fleeing. Still hissing if she saw NK batting under the door. RC is mostly back to her normal routine, other than investigating the door.

Day 3 (today):
RC is now getting within 3 feet if the door. Less csution now; her tail is more in a ""I'm curious"" position. She doesn't flee the door; she'll stare and then mosey back with her tail up, wanting attention. I can now touch NK, then go right to RC and let her sniff; I get a brief grumble and then RC rubs her head on my hands. No issue with scents anywhere else in the shared area. A quick hiss or two if she sees NK batting under the door (we put a box to block the sightline now), but then RC just trots away like nothing happened. NK really starting to indicate he wants out of his room when we put him in there, although he usually calms down after 20 minutes.


Just looking for reassurance that this is going well (seems like it is to me)? Both cats are eating normal, no litter issues, and RC seems very much back to normal behaviours around us, other then being a bit more attentive to noise coming from NK's room.

Also wondering at what point I should consider cracking the door a bit and letting them start seeing each other, with a barrier between them.

Just wondering if anyone has gone through something similar and can help give advice from their experiences. I adopted a cat 3 weeks ago. She was very nervous at first and we just kind of left her to it when we brought her home, didn’t approach her just left her to figure out her surroundings first. Majority of the time she would just hideaway and either eat her food, use her litter tray or play when we were out of the house or at night. The house has plenty of safe hiding spaces for her and we’ve even got feliway plug ins to try relax her. We were able to start playing with her with a wand toy and she was happily playing. 

We then took her to the vets last week because she had a funny looking eye from previous trauma and wasn’t up to date on vaccines. After the vets she hid under out TV unit (a new space she hadn’t been in before) and now spends most of her time there. She’s still playing, eating, using the litter tray overnight but she just seems even more terrified now. 

I am feeling a little hopeless that she will never trust us. But I also accept it’s only been 3 weeks since she moved in with us. Any tips or advice would be hugely appreciated.

I gained his trust and was able to catch him and drop him off at the pound. I offered to take him for a ""trial run"" after he was neutered and given his shots because one, he already trusted me, and two, this is a rural area and the shelter is small and just totally full of kitties. He was so friendly, and I felt like we had a bond, so I was willing to try and adopt him.

I never heard back from the pound and after 1.5 months I found him at the PetSmart up for adoption. I was able to take him finally for a trial run/foster to adopt period. We've had him for about 2 months. From the start he was the most goofy, hyper, loving kitty. I'm totally attached. The problem is, the resident kitty, around 8yo, is NOT. We did the Jackson Galaxy intro method throughout the whole 2 months he's been here. Resident cat still hates his guts and constantly hisses and swats at him whenever he is nearby. He wants to play with her but she can't stand him and is more of a couch potato. I had really hoped they'd become friends. We also found out my partner is really allergic to him (but not resident kitty, for some reason). Finally, I think my apartment is just too small for a cat with his energy level when he has no playmates besides me, and I work :( 

Anyway, I asked the pound if I could just foster him, but they said I have to bring him back if I'm not going to adopt him. My question is-- will he be scared or lonely or confused when I take him back? I feel so guilty and like I failed him. They said they would either put him in the communal cat room so he can play and socialize, or they would send him back to PetsMart.

I’m hoping to get some insight into what’s going on in my friends car when this happens. 

To tell a bit about her, she does her own thing like all cats do and she likes affection sometimes. 

Sometimes she goes on the kitchen counter top when we’re there and comes to me for affection. She does that thing where after a pet her she turns around and shows me her butt which I learned recently is a sign of trust, so that’s great and all. But what I’m curious about now is her staring thing. 

So there’s a coffee table between the couch where we sit and the tv. When my friend and I are just lying there cuddling or start making out she would just jump up onto the table, face US not the tv, curl her tail around her body and just stare at us. I feel like she gets up onto the coffee table so she’s eye level with us. 

She doesn’t sit directly in front of the tv because there’s a large gap between the table and the tv, so she’s not looking for warmth from the tv screen (like I read in other posts). And when she sits there it’s directly in front of us and right in our line of sight so she’s basically blocking the tv screen with her body. 

I’m just curious to know what’s going on in her head, her motives, if it’s curiosity towards us making out and she wants a front row seat or what. Any insight would be greatly appreciated about the staring but moreso about why she gets directly in our line of sight of the tv and sits there. Attention? Jealousy?

My sister suggested maybe getting a cat and it's planted the thought in my mind. 

Firstly, I understand that I can't just get a cat to rely on to fill my loneliness, that's not really the point. I've always been an animal lover and I'm a vegan so I have plenty of respect for animals. I'd like to adopt because there are plenty of cats out there who deserve a loving home, I don't need to go to a breeder. 

My question is, what do I need to consider before I commit to this? I have previously had family pets but nothing I have solely been responsible for. I have a decent sized house with a garden in a quiet, friendly neighbourhood. No kids. My work is very varied, some days WFH, some days out 8-5, some days half and half.

She lets me pet her and rubs up on me and weirdly enough enjoys head-butting me and licking me. I'm going to take all of this as a good sign.  She did have a microchip and the vet did attempt to contact her owner but the number was incorrect and they appear to have moved elsewhere.  

So I have decided to adopt her. My only issue now is she isn't really confident going about my house. she's very unsure of her surroundings and I do not know if there is anything I can do to help settle her in.  Also, I had a very hard first night with her. She really didn't want to be alone so I let her stay in my room and she finally decided to sleep at 2 am and periodically woke up to groom herself. She then woke me up at 6 am with a dead mouse in her mouth. and demanded pets.

My cat L (7 months) has been stressing me out recently. He’s sweet, cuddly, loves everyone, and isn’t too much of a hassle until he gets the zoomies.

Since L has reached the teenage life stage, he’s began to act out purposefully when he’s bored. He won’t use any toys and uses everything else as a replacement. He goes on my nightstand and knocks everything off and other undesired cat behaviors. Something he’s picked up recently is scratching and pulling on my mattress to make noise as he’s a very quiet cat and doesn’t meow much. When he does these things I either completely ignore him, or I’ll put him in ‘time out’ (another room) for a minute while I compose myself. I fear the second option isn’t working anymore as he’s began sprinting into small spaces so I can’t get to him. It seems he now views this as a game.

His behaviors were tolerable until we adopted another kitten (‘S’, recently homed, 5-6 months) around 2 months ago and they’ve been inseparable since, causing both cats to pick up these behaviors from each other. Prior to adopting the second cat, I would kick him out of my room (mostly at night) when he did anything ‘bad’. Now, he does this to scratch at my roommates door to see S. It’s annoying for the both of us as we live in an apartment and his sibling has already torn the carpet up in attempts to get out. 

Another thing is that him and his sibling only play and rarely relax around each other. They’ve integrated very well and love each other, but when his sibling is getting more attention he begins scratching and knocking at things. L also will begin pestering S when he plays with anything but him. 

I’m very lost in this situation as L isn’t a bad cat at all. He’s very well trained and is perfect until he gets bored. Could someone give me ways to eliminate these behaviors? Some ways to enrich his life in ways I haven’t done? I want to ensure he’s content and it seems what I’ve provided isn’t enough for him at the moment.",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,119130,public,self,Teenage cat causing trouble on purpose!,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/z6sc7i/teenage_cat_causing_trouble_on_purpose/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

We have a new kitten homing with our 2 current adult cats (both just over 1). My question is, anyone have any ideas/tips on how to best feed them while we are at work? 

The adult cats are similar age so it was easy before, we left plenty of food for them both to graze on throughout the day. But now, one of the adult cats is a hungry boy all the time! He will (and tries when we are there) to gobble up his food, the other cats food, AND the kitten food. I just know he will get fat and obviously don’t want that.

So do I just accept his fate (until the kitten is nearing adult food) and allow them all to have access to plenty of food? Not a great idea I believe. 

Alternatively do I keep them separated all day so they have their own food? Only issue with this is that the kitten is the child of both adult cats and is SUPER affectionate/tactile. It would break my heart for him to be locked away in a room on his own all day.

I saw somewhere I could put the kittens food in a place only the kitten had access too (through a small gap of boxes). But this may not be ideal as the daddy cat is big and strong and it won’t be long I suspect until the kitten is the same size as mummy cat who is quite small. I also have one of those chip collar feeding bowls coming but I just know again that daddy cat will come over when baby cat is eating and push his head in when the food bowl opens up.

Was wondering what others did in the same situation or if there are any tips people had.

In November 26th I adopted a 3 year old cat. She is gorgeous, and needs a chance at a home as she has been in the shelter for 3 years and has been returned once when she had babies. 

I got her and set her up with her own room. They are separated by a door and haven’t met. Everyday I sit with the 3 year old in the floor and read a book (she took the couch). She just stares at me and eats next to me, doesn’t want me touching her and she hissed which is fine I’m still new to her. I don’t touch her I literally sit there and read. I’m scared she’s unhappy.

I adopted a 3 year old cat 10 days ago(I know it’s not very long ago) and he’s been doing alright. Eating and drinking well, playing a little bit and exploring. However at the shelter they said he was very vocal and liked to be petted with chin scratches and behind the ears, but he won’t let me nor my parents even close to him. If we try and reach out he shys away and I’m scared this will become a problem for vet visits, maintaining his fur and checking him for ticks etc. during the summer. He doesn’t run away and hide but he seems very uncomfortable with hands in general. I’ve been trying to work with him by first giving him a treat and walk to the other side of the room then proceeding to get closer every time he gets a treat to gain his trust. I’m at the point where he will most of the time eat it from my hand but backs off if I move my hand afterwards. When I do have a treat in my hand he will eat it and lick my hand for a while afterwards. He also sniffs our feet and sometimes hands but if I try and pretend to have a treat to get him close he won’t bat an eye and just stare at me. The first three days he only laid under our sofa but he’s been starting to lay in the sofa and around on the floor now but sometimes hides under the sofa again(which is totally fine as he probably like the fact that he gets space but still can be aware of where we are) He always follow us around and wants to be around us but at a distance.  I know I haven’t had him for long and that he’s probably still getting used to a new house and family but I worry that he won’t ever be more comfortable for his sake. We don’t know what he has been through but we know he was found on a landfill but he was already neutered but not chipped so someone either left him there or he was let outside too early and got lost. I’m just very stressed that I’m doing something wrong or it wasn’t a good fit comparing to the two previous cats I’ve had. 

The other things is that for the past two days he’s beeen laying next to our balcony door or looking outside the window on the door meowing a lot as if he really wants to go outside but I dont want to let him outside before I know he’s fully comfortable and knows that this is his home and where to return and since it’s winter I was planning on just keeping him inside till spring because where I live it snows, freezing temps and there’s only two hours of daylight during winter time and if he were to get lost or trapped he wouldn’t stand a chance with this weather but I’m afraid I’m torturing him by keeping him inside for so long.

Looking for insights as to how long it'll take for her to forgive me and perhaps some advice about how to give her medication so that it isn't as stressful for both of us. 

Some quick backstory: I adopted my three-year-old cat a little over a year ago, and it was a challenge at first. She was super shy and refused to go out of hiding for two months. I spent a lot of time and energy building up trust and now she's the most loving and annoying little cat ever. Fast forward to this past week, which has been a hectic one. I moved her back from my parents' house two weekends ago, where she had been staying for roughly six weeks while I was in and out of the city for work. Everything seemed okay, until I noticed her scooting twice and licking her butt and tail a lot, so I took her to the vet this past weekend. Since she absolutely loathes her carrier, these two experiences were not great for her.

The vet gave me some cream to rub on her butthole and some liquid Clavamox. Giving her the medication has proven to be a huge challenge, to the point where I can only really give her both medications once a day instead of twice a day as prescribed. She hides under the couch (and sometimes in the couch), refuses to eat even when there's no medicine mixed with her wet food or treats (thankfully still eating dry food), and is so much more stressed and nervous around me. She's only approached me twice today, and it's only the second day of having to give her medicine.

Normally, my cat forgives me for taking her to the vet or moving her around relatively quickly, usually within a few hours. The fact that she seems so scared of me now and is avoiding me breaks my heart, and it seems that all the work I put into getting her to trust me has been completely undone. I don't even know how I'll be able to continue for the rest of the week, which is the length of time the medicine has been prescribed for.

On the bright side, I suppose, I didn't notice her scooting at all the day before I took her to the vet and she was acting normally, and ever since the vet visit, she hasn't scooted, but I think that's because she's pretty much been in hiding since then.",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,119089,public,self,How long does it take a cat to forgive?

After he finally went back out but tried to get back in again, I was hoping to adopt him but my landlord has said I can't have a pet indoors, then conceded that I could keep feeding it outside.  I'm still pretty heartbroken about it. 

I've got the cat booked for neutering soon, but no shelters will take him due to a combination of overcrowding and his lack of socialization. No vets will even look at him beyond neutering him (which sucks because he's got a weird spot that I want checked out, but that's a whole other problem). None of my friends who foster unsocialized cats can take him yet. I was advised by someone at one of the really good shelters nearby to keep working with him outside in hopes of getting him into adoptable condition by the time they have an opening for him. So the poor little guy is kind of stuck in this situation for now. 

Even though the landlord said I could keep an outdoor cat, recent changes he (the landlord) has made to the property have made the cat prefer to spend most of its time on the new neighbors' property. The landlord installed a panel over the crawlspace under our porch and we found fur stuck to it, suggesting that the cat had tried to squeeze through the panel. We built the cat an outdoor shelter, but it turns out the neighbors have a hole under their porch so the cat prefers it to the shelter. *Sometimes* the neighbors put food near the hole, so they know about him but I don't think they're friends with him the way I am. He also tears open their trash bags to forage through them and leaves a huge mess on their walkway, and he uses some old rubbish on that property as his personal gym. We had bushes that birds hung out in that the cat used to like to watch, but now the landlord has cut them down. The landlord has also put up a giant fence around half the property. 

The cat comes to me when called, usually crossing the neighbors' yard to do so, but now that it's cold, he doesn't want to hang out as much and goes back to the neighbors' house after his meals. I give him a pretty regular food supply, I've put catnip on his stuff here, and I got him one of those little microwavable cat shelter heaters, but after a few minutes he still prefers the safety and spaciousness of being under their porch. He used to show signs of feeling safe with me on our porch, but lately he has  become very jumpy and his socialization progress has regressed a little. 

I'm really worried that the new neighbors are going to get fed up with him. But since my landlord is adamant that the cat cannot be inside and since the cat can't access our crawlspace anymore, I don't know what to do to get him to stay on this property. 

Anyone have any ideas of how to encourage him to stay on this property, or is that fool's errand with strays in winter?",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,119072,public,self,Discouraging stray cat from bothering the neighbors,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/z6hw23/discouraging_stray_cat_from_bothering_the/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

Neutered.\n\n· Breed: Domestic short hair\n\n· Body Weight: Current weight 3.66 lbs.\n\n· History: No prior issues\n\n· Clinical signs: Fever of unknown origin- improving\n\n· Duration: Since Sunday 11/20\n\n· General Location: West Palm Beach, Florida\n\nWe adopted our two kittens Gizmo and Percy a month ago. They are siblings. The initial vet visit was well, both healthy. On Friday 11/18 I took them both in to get their follow up FVRCP vaccine and their rabies vaccine (made by Zoetis Vanguard). The vet deemed them both to be perfectly healthy at this time. I will note that throughout this time Percy has been perfectly fine and the issues have arisen with Gizmo. At the time of the vaccines, he weighed 4.14 lbs.\n\n**11/20:** For the first two days post vaccine both kitties were fine. On Sunday at about 3pm Gizmo began to grow lethargic and withdrawn, he refused any treats, food, or water. We thought it was a possible side effect from the shots as we were told they could experience those within 48 hours and let him rest. No vomiting or diarrhea. \n\n**11/21:** When Gizmo did not improve by Monday we rushed him to the vet. At this point he weighed 3.99 lbs and had a fever of 104. He was given fluids and a blood test was taken, of which the main concerns were elevated ALT, Globulin, and Protein levels based on my recollection and notes. An xray was done for which it was found his GI tract was obstructed, possibility for foreign body ingestion. While plausible, we were perplexed because neither of our cats try to eat random objects, but you never know. We were referred to a veterinary ER nearby and took Gizmo immediately where we checked him in for the night. At the time of his check in there, his fever had increased to 105.2. The plan of action was to fast Gizmo, give him IV fluids throughout the night and re take X rays in the morning to see if the obstruction was still there. He was also given an ultrasound. Medications given were buprenorphine for pain, ondasetron, gabapentin, and antibiotics (unasyn). Ultrasound found no fluid buildup, so at this point it was not looking like wet FIP. The X rays taken in the morning showed his GI tract was clear, so the administering of fluids helped that out, and he had begun to eat again. His fever had broken and come down to 101.5 during the night, but was 103.5 at the time we picked him up. Nurses said throughout the night he was being kitty like again, working overtime and making biscuits all night.\n\n**11/22:** We transferred Gizmo back to the original vet on Tuesday to monitor him for the day and to administer fluids all da because doing the same at the ER would be 4x the cost. He was given antiobiotics, IV fluids, and we re did a blood test. While things like his blood protein were still elevated, they were coming back down to more normalized levels. We picked him up at 6pm this day, with no clear cause on what was causing all of this, at this point the diagnosis was fever of unknown origin. We were given clavamox to administer daily as an antibiotic for 7 days, also given gabapentin for pain/anxiety, and we were prescribed the GI friendly wet food from royal canin and told to hold off on the kibble. We had an illness follow up appointment set for Friday.\n\n**11/23:** Gizmo seemed a lot better this morning. He jumped on the counter for his food, and not long after he climbed to the top of the fridge, and then to the top of the kitchen cabinets (first time up there). He was having a little adventure and seemed more like himself. Throughout the day he became more lethargic and slept/rested much of the day.\n\n**11/24:** While less playful on this day. Didn’t seem to bad, ate his meals, takes his meds well. Slept most of the day again.\n\n**11/25**: Gizmo pooped in the morning. First time we know of since this ordeal started. Didn’t seem to be doing too hot today, but luckily we were going to the vet again. His weight at the vet was 3.66 lbs. We knew he had gotten slimmer but it was concerning to see especially with how fine his brother is at what is probably about 5 lbs now. His fever was at 103.5. His condition has been waxing and waning. The vet held him for the remainder of the day and ran some tests. We did a SNAP test for FeLV/FIV/Heartworm which were negative at the time of adoption and negative again today. Internal organ function screens looked okay, and PCV/Total protein test came back great so we weren’t as concerned about him having dry FIP anymore. His tentative diagnosis was still fever of unknown origin but improving, this vet clinic could not do much else in house. We were told we should monitor him at home but if he gets worse to immediately take him somewhere. We were given a referral to a ER in the area that has specialist to possibly diagnose the root cause, and a follow up check up set for 11/30 when his antibiotic treatment were administering is done.\n\n**11/26:** Gizmo had slept all day, however improved toward the evening. Hes beginning to eat significantly more of his prescribed wet food, and were feeding it to him as often as possible as our main concern is how small and young he is. Starting to look brighter though.\n\n**11/27**: Continuously eating more, bit more of his personality is coming back. I took his temp using a rectal thermometer and it came to 102.8. Were using the occasional cool towel on him to help in a supporting way, but he is eating well and staying hydrated. Current weight still at 3.6 so hes not losing any more weight.\n\nDoes anybody have any advice on what else we can do or have they ever seen something similar. We haven’t yet taken him to see the specialist as his condition seems to be improving (albeit slowly) and the little guy has been through so much this week being poked and prodded that an added car ride/vet trip right now doesn’t seem to be the most helpful especially since he seem anxious about it all but is getting slightly better day by day. Hes so young and small, its been very difficult seeing our very opinionated, vocal, and outgoing orange kitten so down this past week. To be frank, we’re not anti vaxxers, the whole reason we took them to the vet was to receive shots in the first place… but when we politely posed the question if this could be a reaction of some sorts to his vaccine the vet more or less treated it as if we attacked them and was extremely dismissive/aggressive regarding the notion when all we were trying to do was advocate for our beloved kitten who could not do so for himself. Have found a thread or two online of similar experiences of a delayed and prolonged vaccine reaction, but at this point we’re at a loss and hoping he continues to improve.\n\nAlso thinking about the possibility of taking Gizmo to a different vet for his 11/27 follow up that my SO’s family has had more experience with in the past.

She is gentle (I’m a stay at home mom and I monitor their interactions, and taught her to pet and not grab his tail or hit). 

He has scratched her eye twice just by her bending down. He has clawed her legs when she walks by, drawing blood. We cannot keep them separated, as we live in a single family home. Our other cat runs away from her (she is old and skittish). Yui attacks. He has even attacked us, because he wants outside. In city limits, we can’t keep him outside.

We have tried keeping them separated, spraying with water, giving him alone time and more cuddles. Nothing is working, and our second baby will be here in early June. This is NOT a case of rehoming home because we are having another. This is, he is stressed, and these scratches (especially near the eye) can be dangerous. 

People think I haven’t tried every other options. I’ve exhausted them all. I’m gutted. He’s going to miss us, my daughter is going to wonder where he went. I’ve been crying all day. I don’t know if he’ll get as much love and treats. I just need to do what’s best for Yui and our kiddos.

I have a stray cat that frequently hangs out in my garden. I have put up several posters in the area to see if she belongs to anyone and have not received anything back so far. For the past 3 weeks, I have been feeding her and she has been sleeping in my garden. I bought her a cat bed and she seems to enjoy the space. The problem I am having is she is incredibly skittish- she will not let me approach her to pet her or even just stand next to her. I worry as it is cold outside and I really want to check if she is ok and take her to a vet to see if she has been microchipped etc. I don't own any pets and am wondering if there is a way to get her to trust me. I have tried to bribe her with food, catnip, and toys but nothing seems to be working. Any ideas would be incredibly helpful. I want her to be able to trust me and if she does not have an owner I am looking to adopt.

I brought him home by train and metro.
He was very quiet for 30 minutes and the next half hour he started meowing on the train. Tears came to my eyes, he was staring at me with his beautiful big eyes while meowing. He will miss his family (and his brother).

Once at home I locked myself in the bathroom with him, I put a pillow under the radiator, and gave him something to eat and drink. I spent two hours sitting on the floor with him, petting him, letting him explore and watching him sleep. Then I let him discover the kitchen and the main room.
He ended up eating, drinking and doing his business in his litter box. When I went to bed he came to snuggle with me, then he stuck to my face. I turned my back and he went to sleep on the sofa.

Everything is going well, only I feel bad. I have no appetite, my nose and throat are a little blocked (I had a cat and a rabbit at my parents' house for 18 years and never had any allergies). I am sensitive to the smell of cat drool when he plays, try to lick my nose. And also he leaves small deposits of fecal matter where he sits (sofa, cat tree, my sheets) probably microscopic but I can smell it. This kitten is clean though.

So here I am with all these feelings. 

He seems quite happy in my apartment, he purrs a lot and asks to play and cuddle. 
I'm afraid to leave him alone during the day for 9 hours, I'm afraid he'll do something bad / get bored.
For the moment I have only one toy, a thing with feathers, but I am afraid that he will ingest it by chewing on it.

I don’t feel like he should sleep in the corridor and not in the main room with me because it would be lonely somehow. But I dont want him IN my bed nor pillow.

The problem is, my cat has been sitting in front of the door all night waiting for me to come home 🥲 She hasn't moved at all. She's eating ok though and used the litter box ok, but it just breaks my heart seeing her just sitting there. I used the audio on the camera once to tell her it's ok, but she just looked around confused and it was so heartbreaking I didn't do it again 🥲🥲🥲 Help! 

Also, she is in fospice care with me (terminal cancer) so I can't get a companion cat (and she doesn't do well with other cats). I also don't want to put her in a cat hotel.

Today, he looks like he wants to eat but didn’t eat. And his poop is watery too. He looks really tired too.

T had always been the only cat. After months of slowly introducing them to each other following the standard procedure.

Now 8 weeks later, I've had to work extra hours with the weather getting worse I know T would be sleeping all day. But now I know which neighbour has been looking after him I don't know what to do.

Do I ask them to just stop feeding or stop feeding and not let him in (I know that would upset him as he doesn't want to come home at the minute anyway) while I try to reintroduce the cats?

We have an 8 year old female cat we adopted over a year ago.
The resident cat’s background/personality:
She was sent to the rescue after her last owner passed. Due to her previous experience with multiple owners and fosters, it takes her a while to warm up to people and she gets scared easily. But once she trusts a person, she turns into such a lovely cat.

And then there is a 1 year old female cat we recently adopted. 
The new cat’s background/personality:
She was a stray cat and was rescued with her little kittens 2-3 months before we adopted her.
She loves attention and food. She constantly purrs, meows, kneads and rubs her face against anyone’s hand. She seemed to be okay around other cats when we went to the rescue centre to see her.


It has been 6 weeks since we brought the new cat home, and they HATE each other.
Here is what’s been going on. (Sorry this is a lot of details)

- When we brought the new cat home, we had our office room ready for her with a litter box, food bowl, cat bed, cat tree, etc. We didn’t let them see each other but let them smell each other through the door. We fed them together (with the door closed) so they can associate food to each other’s smell. The resident cat was quite anxious and hissing a lot. She wasn’t even comfortable passing that door. But over time, she has gotten better and now she can tolerate eating 2 feet away from the door. (But she still hisses and runs off after finishing her food.)

- We have been keeping the new cat in the office room, and the resident cat in the bedroom. They take turns to explore around the house throughout the day. We usually sleep with the resident cat, but I have been sleeping with the new cat in the office room because she meows so much.


- On our week 2, they ran into each other. (My partner just open the office room to see the new cat, and she just ran downstairs to the kitchen) There was no hissing or any interactions other than eye-contact. (But there was a bit of screaming from their humans…)

- On our week 3,  they ran into each other again. (My partner just opened the bedroom door without knowing the new cat was right behind him) And the new cat just straight up attacked the resident cat who was sleeping next to me. The resident cat was absolutely terrified. There was chunks of hair in the new cat’s paws :(

- We let them see each other through a babygate. My partner was on the resident cat’s side and I was on the new cat’s side. The resident cat was 10 feet away from the babygate, hiding under a chair. After a few stares, the new cat attempted to climb the babygate. There were some hissing and howling. We ended the session after that.

- We also got a huge playpen(tent) and installed it in the living room. At first we tried keeping the new cat in the tent all day and let the resident cat approach her when she feels comfortable. For the first 2 days, the resident cat didn’t even come downstairs. On the third day, she came downstairs but when she came closer to the tent, the new cat tried to attack her.


And now we are on week 7. We’ve watched a lot of youtube videos and read many articles, tried calming treats and all different types of Feliway plugins as well. I am so lost and beginning to wonder if it’s time for me to give up. I feel like I’m just torturing the cats and ourselves.

I have many friends who have cats but never heard of any failure stories… Do people often give up on cat introductions? If I continue this, would they eventually get along?

Things i have done, most of which came from cat advice channels on youtube

She went to the vet for a checkup/shots when i first trapped her.

Made her a special private room with a bed near a window, built her a carpeted box to hide/sleep in.

Removed most hiding places in the room except ones i created for her to keep her from secluding her self. I was letting her roam between rooms but found a video that said i should keep her in one room and just hang out in there.

I bought some catnip spray and sprayed it on her toys but she doesn't use them. I tried staying in the room when i fed her but she won't eat if im in there.

I clean her litter box every day sometimes more than once a day. I put on gloves and sprayed them with catnip to try and coax her into letting me at least get my hand near her and she runs off or if i get too close hisses. I slow blink and stay low to the ground to try and not appear like a threat.

I need some advice &amp; was hoping to maybe get some feedback before Monday for the sake of my nerves. 

I have a 9 year old cat (Baylor) &amp; he recently came down with a super nasty cough, so I took him to the vet. It was an absolute nightmare &amp; he screamed/relieved himself the entire time he was in the back getting treated. I think (no, I know) he traumatized a beagle named Ralphie as well as 2 other cats &amp; a rabbit. The pigeons resting on the power lines outside probably sought out therapy because of what they heard. It was awful… anyways… 
He was also due for his yearly vaccines, so the vet decided to administer his antibiotics/steroids/vaccines all at once. The alternative was to put him through a 2nd trip &amp; sedate him, but he thought that would be more traumatic than just doing it all at once, so that’s what we did. That’s been 10 days ago exactly, &amp; his vet said the antibiotics would stay in his system for 2 weeks (if that’s relevant). 

Post-vet trip, he definitely didn’t feel well, but that was expected &amp; within 2 days his cough was gone &amp; he’d perked back up. While he was still recovering though, he stayed pretty much under our bed the entire time with the exception to eat &amp; potty. It’s worth noting (I think) that we recently moved in July &amp; our bedroom has carpet, which is something he’s never laid on before. I only mention that because I feel like it’s possible that the reason he is still staying under the bed is because it’s a new hiding spot he discovered that made him feel “safe” while he was feeling sick and plus it’s warm (I’m in KY so winter is settling in). 

But that’s what I need advice on - he’s still under the bed &amp; comes out pretty much never. For a few days he was out &amp; about more often than he is now. Idk. 
He’ll come downstairs &amp; meow for treats, but right back upstairs he goes straight under the bed. 
I have noticed that while he’s still using the litter box, there are a couple drops of pee (likes he’s dribbled) outside the box; however, we have another cat &amp; he’s a hot mess - he’s the messiest litter box user in all the land, so idk that it isn’t him. 

Anyways, he acts 100% normal, he looks normal in the eyes, when I check on him he’s responsive &amp; seems coherent, he just seems to have no desire to leave his little nest under the bed. 
Which, I have no issues with him being under there, so long as he’s okay. 

I’m calling his vet Monday, but was hopeful for some feedback before then. 
I hate to put him back through it because he’ll have to be sedated before they’ll work with him, especially if it’s unnecessary. Jeeze. 

Anyways - thank you for your feedback!

I also took a shower and washed all the minoxidil that was left in my body, changed my clothes,, opened the window of the room where I was sitting, ventilated while them not allowed in

630am and 930pm. Both adjusted quick but one cat my calico took a little longer to get used to the new schedule but it was no longer than a few days extra than my other cat. 

Now i feed them once a day at night 930pm but i feed them the same amount of food as i always have but just all at night. They have no problems eating, no vomit, and they are very active after eating which is fine. 

But my concern and i guess annoyance is my calico again is having trouble adjusting. She bothers all day meowing at me for food. Every morning she still thinks shes getting fed and throws a fit. By a fit i just mean meowing at me constantly as i get ready for work at 5am. Its been nearly two weeks now and she hasn’t adjusted to her new feeding schedule. My other cat has and she has no problem. Again i feed them the same amount of food just all at night. Its wet canned food. 
Their weight is healthy as well so i know my calico isn’t starving.

I've had one of the cats for almost eight years now (he'll be 8 in a couple months) and he's always been a grazer. He'll eat just a little bit at a time and likes having food in his bowl all day. Several months ago we got a new kitten, he's 11 months old now and is a little food crazy. If food is left out he'll eat it all. This has led to him eating too much food, and my older cat not getting enough and losing some weight. 

I tried giving the older cat wet food at night (along with the dry food during the day) but he rarely eats it all. I've tried ~10 different wet foods and there's only been one kind that he'd eat a whole can of (smaller cans not big ones) but that only lasted about a week before he didn't want it anymore. 

I'm trying to feed them in separate rooms, but my older cat just barely eats any food! I worry I won't be able to break his habit of wanting to eat little bits at a time.

I'm looking for advice on any other ways I could help my cat eat more in one sitting, or some foods with higher protein/calories that could be better for him to eat if he's going to eat such a small amount at a time. Or ways I could get the younger cat to graze on the food as well instead of stuffing himself with any food in sight lol.

However, today he moved his blanket off his bed and weed on the heating pad there.

Overall he's a bit more dog like in how he likes company.

And the main problem is that there person next door has an agressive dog. I don't think they let him out. But we are not sure of that. Plus there are community strays around the area. 

Is it a good idea to move in and keep her as a fully indoor cat? 

Best case scenario would be that they neighbor will keep their dog inside so she can roam around. But I think its most likely that we should keep her as a completely indoor cat. 

I am just worried that since she liked to spend time in the lawn and roam around she will be stressed in the new home.

Adopted two fluffy Siamese mix sisters in June, everything pretty smooth except we're struggling to provide enough play for one of them. Wisp is a very active kitty who loves hunting and fighting and biting, she definitely has her snuggly moments and loves us and her sister but has sooo much energy. It's proving difficult to keep her focused on toys for longer periods of time, once she gets bored of playing with a toy and we stop, she immediately starts to attack stuff in the house. 

The blinds are a big issue accelerating our need for toys because she is systemically destroying them. Every window blind has pieces missing and we're increasingly afraid that our landlord will take notice of it if she continues. Keeping them rolled up isn't feasible as we're visible for anyone coming in the apartment building due to our apt placement. Curtains are against the lease terms unfortunately too.

Getting her redirected to toys is just getting harder with time. If anyone can suggest toys that might scratch this itch for her please let me know!! Anything work for your cats? Got any ideas that might fit what she needs? I'm running low on ideas. Details on what we've learned so far:

What she seems to enjoy is being able to reach/jump up and hunt things above her. The blinds are heavenly, she also climbed and ripped apart a small potted tree. Climbing it and hunting the leaves as they shook in response to her climbing was irresistible. She got bored when the leaves were all ripped off and the thin trunk was bent sideways so climbing wasn't very good.

I have a tall tower scratcher, medium height cat tree with 3 tallish levels, and a dangling bungee toy attached to a doorway arch. They just can't compete with the sweet sweet blinds. Other toys she likes but can't focus on anymore are the little plastic springs to hunt, and feather/ribbon bird on a wand. If these fail to work for short play sessions I don't know what we'll do to entertain her anymore haha.",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,118890,public,self,"Suggestions for kitten toys? ~6 mo twins, active kitten loves shredding blinds and is causing lots of damage!",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/z5234u/suggestions_for_kitten_toys_6_mo_twins_active/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

She’s always been a bit quirky, and I discovered quickly after I adopted her at 3 months, that if I gave her wet food without mashing it up completely with water into a thinner paste/soup, that she would just grab chunks and pull them on the floor. She also ate her dry food so fast that I had to buy her a slow feeder.

She’s done well with adjustments I made according to her weird habits  and I haven’t really had issues until a few months ago when I noticed she was using her paws to scoop out her wet food and either lick it off her paws, or eat it off the ground.

I thought maybe the dish we had was too deep and narrow and it was hurting her whiskers to use that bowl, so I bought bowls that are flat and wide. Unfortunately it hasn’t helped and I’m running out of ideas. I’ve even put down a mat to help curb messes.

I’m now thinking that maybe I should get an elevated pet bowl to see if it’s more to do with the discomfort of eating from a bowl on the floor.

I’m wondering if anyone else has dealt with this sort of problem before and what things were tried and what worked.

I’m just worried because she’ll jump straight from her litter and then use her paws to eat. I can’t imagine that’s good for her :( not to mention I obviously don’t want my cat eating straight off the floor. Sometimes I step in food without realizing and she’ll just eat that too. Or she’ll eat random hair and then have hairball issues that she’s already prone to.

One other weird food bowl issue I’ve also noticed recently is that she sometimes gets in this obsessive mindset of trying to bury her food. Of course she cannot dig into my floor, she she ends up scratching around her bowl until sometimes she tips it over. I have her food dish as far from her litterbox as I can have it, because I’ve read that sometimes cat’s will want to bury their scent and of course a kill/eating area is something cats would want to coverup from predators or other cats.

I know it’s a lot of info, but I’m hoping someone will have gone through something similar and can give me ideas that I haven’t tried.",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,118888,public,self,Advice on my cat using her paws to eat wet food,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/z51d67/advice_on_my_cat_using_her_paws_to_eat_wet_food/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

After a few months, when I noticed she was waking me up to demand her food, I stopped doing that, and gave her food each evening instead. 

The problem is, she never unlearned this habit, and since then wake me up nearly each morning at 4-6 am. 
She is very demanding, purring, licking, climbing me, and above all, the dreadfully ""paw in the eye"" maneuver!
She is relentless, until I'm up and about, then she will go eat without further problem and let me go back to sleep (if I manage to...)

Some details:

She have a tower feeder.  Each evening I put enough kibble for 24h. So she have far enough kibble in the tower for her morning meal. 

She know how to feed herself from the tower, and doesn't need me. She just wait until I'm up and in the same room as the feeder to do it... I don't even have to approach the feeder, just being in the same room... 

To be more precise, there is a stair leading to the main room. 
If I am on the last step of the stair, she will wait, keep peace between the feeder and me, prodding me to continue. 
If I make one more step to be in the room, she will be content and eat, I'm not needed anymore..

My apartment is really open, with no door that I could use to prevent her from sleeping with me and walking me up (and I like the fact that she sleep with me every night)

I just very recently learned about single Kitten Syndrome and feel so guilty for adopting her alone and feel like her quality of life is so low because she doesn’t have a friend. My sister has two cats but we’ve tried for over a year to slowly socialize them together and it is absolutely not working. When they have accidentally gotten at each other with no cage, My cat will run after them and pounce on them when their social cues indicate they don’t want that. My sister is very well versed in cat care so we have been taking all the proper steps to try and socialize them slowly but she just won’t reduce her aggression. I think she’s trying to play but they perceive it as an attack - which it pretty much is. 

I really want to help her overcome this, as she’s going to be without me soon when I go off to college next summer. I want her to have someone else to play with besides my dad and sister because they are busy people. I also would like her to be able to move from my dads house with me eventually and I don’t feel comfortable with her being away from our remote area with no other outdoor cats. My ultimate goal is for her to be able to be more of an indoor cat (I’m aware of the ethical and environmental problems with indoor/outdoor cats which is why I want her to get more stimulation within the home so she doesn’t crave the outdoors so much). My question currently is: Would it be a good idea to get her her own kitten friend? The reason I think it might be better is because my sisters cats are heavily bonded and are already afraid of her. I don’t see them warming up to her anytime soon. I thought maybe it would be a good idea to teach her to socialize appropriately on her own new friend, maybe a kitten because she might be more gentle with it? I just want her to be happy without having to be outside most of the day, and I wish this wasn’t a problem I love her so much and want her to have cat friends to play with. Please be gentle about this I am already so anxious about her and her happiness i shame myself so much for this. Please let me know if this would be a good idea and if you have any other suggestions.

He’s healthy overall but tested positive for roundworms- not surprising since he’s lived outdoors for most of his life.

I am prefacing this by making it clear she’s going to be checked out by the vet in a few days (which was the soonest they could fit her in) 

Background info: 
My cat has always been aggressive when I have visitors, but it’s been manageable. 

Recently she’s been aggressive with me - this has been only following a specific incident. 

I blew a hiking safety whistle in the kitchen (just not thinking) and it triggered an “episode” where she started yowling at me, pupils dilated, and aggressively following me as I backed away from her until I could cordon her into a part of the house to calm down. (I had some gabepenton gave to her in food to help the calm) 

Since then there’s been multiple occasions where she though I was going to do that loud noise thing in the kitchen, and has began to do the same behaviours. 

The last two days in particular have been hellish because she mistook my being at the bench in the kitchen as a possible re-do, I caught her eye and noticed her pupils dilating and beginning to take the strange body language she displayed that night, and has been aggressive ever since. 

I thought the night would “reset” her to calm mode, but this morning she was on edge and not really comfortable as I moved about my morning duties, tentative and anxious, sharply observing me - I fed her and played for a while with her toy but noticed whenever I caught her eye her focus would be primarily on me and not the toy and I sensed it wouldn’t take much at all to set her off again. Cut to me making a tea in the kitchen, and she was at my feet, when I looked down and at her, the pupils went big again and she began her tense body and meowing, and as soon as I back away she yowls louder and it’s happening once again. 

I feel so guilty because she’s spend most of the last 36 hours or so blocked off in a small part of the house. I’m giving her the gabepenten in food serves to try and calm some of this - but I just feel awful, it’s a silly mistake I made one time, thats turned into what appears to be a trauma for her - as she already had a nervous disposition. Now our relationship has been severely impacted, the trust seems gone. I always appreciated that she was a cranky little defensive thing, but with me she was tolerant, and even sometimes, when I was lucky, loving and a lap cat etc. 

I’m terribly afraid of what’s going to happen at the vets - because the last few times I’ve brought her in, it’s basically been a costly bust, because they’re not willing to take her out of her cage (understandably) even with the gabepenton, so they’ve not been able to perform a full check. 

This time they say they’ll sedate her and check her ears because she’s been shaking her head frequently and seems bothered by her ears. (This also makes me feel awful because what if the whistle caused some damage!?) 

Anyways - now all the background has been provided - my question is - how do I make it through the next 3 days if her temperament remains on this level? Am I going to have to keep drugging her and sequestering her in small rooms until then, for my own safety? Isn’t that only going to cause her further trauma and distrust? 

Any tips on how to navigate such an aggressive frame of mind of hers until she can be seen to would be so very appreciated!

It took new kitty (Gus) a while to get comfortable, but it's now been a few weeks of them all mingling successfully without supervision needed! I have Gus and another boy, and they get along, they've started playing and everything, they also eat dinner side by side everyday. My roommate has two cats as well. 



Gus is a larger guy compared to two and the one he doesn't suddenly get along with (Soup) is definitely the biggest. Gus would still be on edge for a while while walking by Soup and would hiss and maybe swat if Soup got too close but that was it. 


Yesterday all of a sudden a cat fight broke out between the two while I was out of the house. My roommate described it to be pretty scary, and both of them were going toward one another... so we decided to keep Gus isolated in my room for the night, and just today I decided to let Gus out to see how it would go... and yes, the two went to fight again. I initially grabbed gus who was trying to get out of my arms and run away while Soup was climbing up me to attack. I then grabbed Soup who mauled up my arm while Gus ran away. 



I'm at a loss and I'm panicked. Rehoming isn't an option, and me and my roommate likely won't be living together much longer since I may be moving out of town.

I have seen kitten play dates are a bad idea on here, I’m worried about the potential of her getting used to the new house then after this month moving back here to our house where her space would be reduced to one floor instead of three.

The plot also gets even more complicated when one of the cats I’m taking care of over there is one my neighbor is contemplating rehoming to me when I move out within the next year. So that would mean my cat would have to get used to and test it out to see if she likes him. But I don’t know if I should stress her out for such a short term thing, and I don’t plan to as of now.

Glad to be around fellow cat enthusiasts. 

I have a dilemma on a potential foster fail situation and I’d like to get some perspective. 


I’ve been fostering for about a year and a half and have fostered 20 cats. Very early in our foster days, my partner and I adopted a brother and sister from a litter we were fostering. We wanted to keep the girl immediately and we kept her brother because he was nervous and needed a pal. We love them unconditionally and have no regrets whatsoever. My partner and I acknowledge we were overzealous at the time and probably should’ve given them a chance to get adopted out. Fast forward, and we have significantly more fostering experience after 20 kittens. I love my fosters, but I’ve never been that attached to them and am happy when they find their homes. 

Until we got our current fosters last weekend, Truffles and Butterscotch, a bonded pair of calico sisters. My heart exploded the moment I let them out of their carrier. They’re 6 months old, my oldest fosters so far. They are so loving, polite, cuddly, get along with my cats, and well mannered girls. They wanted to sleep under the covers with us immediately and be carried around like babies. My partner and I are *so* torn on keeping them. We fully acknowledge 4 cats is a lot of work, cleaning, more vet bills and more commitment. But we adore them in a way I haven’t felt about any of my previous fosters, including my own cats. Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE my cats. But it took me a while to feel that level of connection with them. Both my partner and I feel highly emotional at the thought of them leaving our house, and neither of us have felt that before.

My partner and I have two beautiful cats (7yo Persian/Ragdoll male and 3yo Persian female). We recently adopted a British Shorthair kitten (3.5 months-ish male) and he is very excited and active, as kittens are..

The 7yo is fine with him but sometimes loses his patience. The 3yo, however, is very stressed by the kitten. She hasn't been nice to him once. She hisses and growls at him if she sees him nearby and bats him if he dares to get too close. I know this stuff is normal, but he's been home over a month with no improvement.

This evening I was trying to remove some of her matted fur and she got very aggressive with me. She also seems to have some balding spots on the side of her belly (possibly over grooming, or maybe from matting?) she often gets matts but it's never been this alarming. She's also losing her voice from hissing so much.

We have feliway friends plugins but they don't seem to be helping. I absolutely adore my little Persian, she's always been feisty and a little distant, but now she seems VERY stressed and aggressive with everyone, not just the kitten.

The kitten has a special room he's been confined to since he came home so they have their own 'safe spaces' but I'm worried my little Persian is going to end up in a bad way from the stress.

Four days ago they suddenly got into a nasty fight. They were both sleeping in our bed and out of the blue we started hearing yeowling and hissing. The smaller one hid and there were drops of urine and bits of fur on the floor. After this I separated them, and kept them in different rooms, each with water, food and litterboxes. 

One day later I tried to unite them again. They were fine for 20 minutes, and then started fighting again. 

Now I've been keeping them separated for 3 days. They are chill with me and my partner, they just dont like being stuck in rooms, without being able to roam around the house. One of the rooms has a glass door, so I can have them both looking at eachother without touching - however, I have been doing this for short periods of time since when they see eachother they freak out and stare, with raised hairs. Both seem agressive towards one another. 

Last time I did this (today), the smaller one hid, and has been hiding inside the glass door room ever since. 

I have bought a Feliway diffuser, but so far no results. They have been seen by a vet, that said it seemed a comportamental issue and suggested medicating one of them (the initial agressor).

It's on the field, near a forest, so chances of escaping are high. She's climbed to trees before, but the parents of my girlfriend won't be able to climb after her. Also now there are 2 new dogs that she doesn't know. She will have the whole house for her and will be able to sleep wherever she wants.

2nd option: a room in the house of a friend. This friend has another cat and 2 dogs. Our cat has leucemia (no symptoms though), so she won't be able to mingle with the other cat, which is why she'd be in a room. We're not sure if the friend's cat has the vaccine for leucemia but we're offering to pay it, just in the event that she escapes that room (she will 100% escape at least twice). The good thing is that ""escaping"" here doesn't mean that she will be out in the forest.

3rd option: not a lot. Pet hotels are either too expensive or they keep the animals in cages, which would be worse than option 2.

My girlfriend and I recently (month ago) adopted two cats from the local shelter. One (7month male) and the other (2.5 yr female). Both fixed and such. 

Does anyone have any suggestions - I am feeling a bit like we made a mistake not getting either *just* the 2.5 yr old or not getting the 7mo along with another kitten from his litter. 

He is very active and curious. He wants to play anytime he isn’t sleeping. She enjoys laying low all day long and can sit in front of the window for hours on end. She isn’t really interested in play time (maybe about 10 min max (if that) a day). Obviously this isn’t the best mix. He walks around sadly meowing sometimes like he really wants a friend. I work from home so I can give him a bit of attention but I really feel like he needs a friend around his age with similar energy. 

We cannot get a third cat at our apartment (2 max). Also, we don’t know her history - the shelter didn’t have much info to share. (Don’t know if she was someone’s house pet that they gave up or what). He and his liter were found in a trash can and spent the first 6 months at the shelter. 

At first she was very scared of him. Hissing and running and hiding anytime he got near. (We had them meet at the shelter and that didn’t happen there). Over the course of the last month that has improved and it isn’t as often. However he tries to play with her and it truly seems like she just doesn’t understand what play is. We thought they were finally playing together the other day but once the wrestling stopped it was clear she did not know that it was play (she was extremely shaken and anxious for ~20 min after). 

I guess I’m not sure what to do. Perhaps she needs to be in a home where she is the only cat. She’s not very affectionate towards humans either. But I don’t know if that’s in part because the kitten is always around.

Our dog is a grazer, so it’s not ideal to put his food away — but that may ultimately be the easiest and best solution. 

In the meantime, I’ve been feeding our cat less of her food to hopefully balance it out.

However this is a problem at night. At some point, he starts to complain to go out. After an hour or so he comes back. He usually repeats this 2-3 times until the morning. I’ve tried several times to spare other family members from waking up from his meows by trying to get him to sleep in my bedroom at least for a few hours, but he meows deeply and sadly pretty soon.

The solution for this in the warmer months is by leaving him in the nearby shed over the night where he has food/water and a litterbox inside. I pick him up in the morning. However the nights are much colder now, it can get around 32F (0C) outside, not much warmer in the shed. I feel like it’s not right to leave him there while it’s that cold, I feel guilty that he would be freezing and having health problems afterwards. At this point I am pretty much desperate to find a solution for the winter months.

We got our cat in March from the local shelter; she was declawed and immediately surrendered by her previous owner and has some other trauma, as well as previously being indoor/outdoor. Ever since we got her she has always pooped outside of the litter box. She'll pee in it but is really inconsistent about pooping. 

She has two litter boxes in different parts of the house that are always accessible to her and they're scooped daily. I switch out the litter every 4-6 weeks. She has a soft litter (okocat) for her paws and I put Cat Attract in it when I swap out the boxes.

We've swapped out her food for one that suits her, gone through three or four litters, got a hood for both of her boxes, took off a hood, bought a new box, put it in another location, we encourage her and give her extra affection every time we see her use the litter box, and we move her into the litter box if she looks like she's about to go.

We took her to the vet months ago, but the vet told us that she was perfectly healthy, just having behavioral problems, but to keep trying new things. 

It's incredibly stressful and honestly embarrassing especially that it's gone on this long, and I absolutely would never rehome her unless I literally could not take care of her anymore financially and/or physically but I'm running out of solutions. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason-- she'll have a perfectly clean fresh litter box and then just walk in our room, poop by the XBox, twitch her tail a couple of times, and leave. No texture preference either-- brick, carpet, and our regular plastic flooring are all vulnerable to her ass. She's a very large cat, especially since she's not adult age yet, and she poops at least two or three times per day and her stool is huge.

I don’t have much background on where she came from but I can say she likely was not socialized properly.

Miss Maisie is 4 months old and I can tell she wants to be loved ! She will play with her ribbon toy, she will eat food out of my hand. I’ve lured her up super close to my face to where she was standing on me with a treat. She is not afraid to be around generally. She comes in the couch if I’m sitting up there, she sleeps on the couch or in the cat tree. Sometimes in the kitchen she doesn’t even run if I walk past her. She even sleeps on my legs sometimes, or I’ll feel her walking up my back while I’m laying down “asleep”. She gets close and sniffs but quickly darts away. 

It’s like she just has really bad anxiety. I do handle her quite often and whenever I have people over they like to play with her. My boyfriend handles her as well. Sometimes I approach her on the cat tree and let her sniff me and give her a little pet. Sometimes she hisses but she’s not aggressive- she’s never bitten or scratched me. Her ears are never back either. The fact that she will eat from my hands - which I take advantage of- makes me believe she kinda trusts me at least a little? As bad as it is I give her whipped cream when I have it, in exchange I pet her while she eats it.

I brought a pheromone diffuser , I think she seems a LITTLE less skittish but it’s also only been 5 days. What else can I be doing? I can’t tell if I should handle her more or handle her less.

My girl always voiced her disapproval by peeing, but very rarely (maybe 3 times since we got them a year ago) and it was always very clear what the reason was (she peed on clothes that smelled like a different cat that lay on the floor for some time for example). 

So roughly two weeks ago, she suddenly started peeing into the corridor and the bathroom in three different spots. We went to the vet, medically she is fine. I'm trying to figure out what the problem is, but I'm struggling here, so maybe someone has some ideas. 

So what I've already figured out/ruled out: 

Changes: My schedule changed and I'm home a bit less. My SO is home the same amount of time as before, and the cats schedule didn't change (same feeding and play times). Also, I disconnected their water fountain and switched it temporarily to a simple bowl (because the cats didn't use it and I was planning on trying a different one. Extra problem, the water pump started to be super loud and annoying after a year). But could that really be why she pees outside the box? Two to three times a day? And if so, what can I do to stop it?

What I'm already doing right: the two cats have three litter boxes that get cleaned two to three times a day. They don't have a lid or lining and are placed both in social and a bit more quiet areas throughout the house (living room, bathroom and by the entrance), also no litter changes. The pee spots get cleaned with enzyme cleaners every time after the cat pees there. We play with wand toys three times a day for ~15-20 mins each, we have regular feeding times. The cats have toys they can play play themselves, cat trees, window spots, and get lots of attention and love. There is no tension between the cats, they play with each other and all seems fine. We had a feliway diffuser before when we they came to us but stopped using it shortly after, we bought a new one two days ago, but it didn't change anything yet.

And also don't care. And thus it's for me to ""fix"" the problem before I get kicked out...

Short story long, I've adopted 2 kittens - they are 14 weeks old now. They are very kind, playful, and cute. They sleep the entire day but they have this thing where they get crazy active around 1-2 AM.

They look like ""posseted"" creatures. They hit everything, jump from all over the place and run like crazy. Initially I thought I can get them tired, but they can keep at it over 1 hour...  They mostly chase each other, but even if just one of them feels like this, he's doing it all by himself. And it's terrible for my neighbours.

Currently, what I do is when they get active, I close them in the smallest room - the bathroom. They miau for 5 minutes, hit the door... but eventually they go to sleep. However, I feel bad to do this.

I've tried feeding them earlier (last meal at 19-20). I tried feeding them late (last meal at 23). I tried playing with them for over 1h with all sorts of toys - around 9PM. It's great, at 10 they go to sleep, wake up an 2AM and go crazy again.

I tried keeping them awake during the day, but... I still have to work. Every time I stop giving them attention, they just go to sleep.   


Usually I try to hit the bed around 11 - where I stay 1h longer reading. Sometimes they come sleep with me, sometimes they don't...

Note: They also have a small window of crazy activity in the morning, around 8. But it ends after I feed them (usually at 8:30) - they just go to sleep after.

I have an 14 year old cat who’s all of a sudden started deficating and urinating only on my toddler sons playmat and toys which is in the living room 

This started in Monday maybe, the only thing that’s changed is we removed the playpen which surrounded it and got rid of the cabinet next to it as my son has learned to climb 

She does it in front of us and the runs off, she still uses her litter box once or twice a day 

We took her to to vets but they couldn’t get her a blood test as she got distressed so taking her back next week 

We’ve been soaking the area in simple solution cat stain remover I’m at my wits end I don’t know what to do 

I don’t have the hands spare to clean it up without my child getting in it, I can’t do this everyday. It’s becoming such a problem,

Her litter is in cellar which she can get too as she also has her food in there, this is the only place we can really put it which stops the baby getting to it

Is there anything else we can try whilst waiting for the vet appointment to see if there’s a medical issue",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,118709,public,self,Cat has all of a sudden started peeing on my toddlers play mat and toys,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/z3nusj/cat_has_all_of_a_sudden_started_peeing_on_my/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

My girl always voiced her disapproval by peeing, but very rarely (maybe 3 times since we got them a year ago) and it was always very clear what the reason was (she peed on clothes that smelled like a different cat that lay on the floor for some time for example). 

So roughly two weeks ago, she suddenly started peeing into the corridor and the bathroom in three different spots. We went to the vet, medically she is fine. I'm trying to figure out what the problem is, but I'm struggling here, so maybe someone has some ideas. 

So what I've already figured out/ruled out: 

Changes: My schedule changed and I'm home a bit less. My SO is home the same amount of time as before, and the cats schedule didn't change (same feeding and play times). Also, I disconnected their water fountain and switched it temporarily to a simple bowl (because the cats didn't use it and I was planning on trying a different one. Extra problem, the water pump started to be super loud and annoying after a year). But could that really be why she pees outside the box? Two to three times a day? And if so, what can I do to stop it?

What I'm already doing right: the two cats have three litter boxes that get cleaned two to three times a day. They don't have a lid or lining and are placed both in social and a bit more quiet areas throughout the house (living room, bathroom and by the entrance), also no litter changes. The pee spots get cleaned with enzyme cleaners every time after the cat pees there. We play with wand toys three times a day for ~15-20 mins each, we have regular feeding times. The cats have toys they can play play themselves, cat trees, window spots, and get lots of attention and love. There is no tension between the cats, they play with each other and all seems fine. We had a feliway diffuser before when we they came to us but stopped using it shortly after, we bought a new one two days ago, but it didn't change anything yet.

And also don't care. And thus it's for me to ""fix"" the problem before I get kicked out...

Short story long, I've adopted 2 kittens - they are 14 weeks old now. They are very kind, playful, and cute. They sleep the entire day but they have this thing where they get crazy active around 1-2 AM.

They look like ""posseted"" creatures. They hit everything, jump from all over the place and run like crazy. Initially I thought I can get them tired, but they can keep at it over 1 hour...  They mostly chase each other, but even if just one of them feels like this, he's doing it all by himself. And it's terrible for my neighbours.

Currently, what I do is when they get active, I close them in the smallest room - the bathroom. They miau for 5 minutes, hit the door... but eventually they go to sleep. However, I feel bad to do this.

I've tried feeding them earlier (last meal at 19-20). I tried feeding them late (last meal at 23). I tried playing with them for over 1h with all sorts of toys - around 9PM. It's great, at 10 they go to sleep, wake up an 2AM and go crazy again.

I tried keeping them awake during the day, but... I still have to work. Every time I stop giving them attention, they just go to sleep.   


Usually I try to hit the bed around 11 - where I stay 1h longer reading. Sometimes they come sleep with me, sometimes they don't...

Note: They also have a small window of crazy activity in the morning, around 8. But it ends after I feed them (usually at 8:30) - they just go to sleep after.

She does it in front of us and the runs off, she still uses her litter box once or twice a day 

We took her to to vets but they couldn’t get her a blood test as she got distressed so taking her back next week 

We’ve been soaking the area in simple solution cat stain remover I’m at my wits end I don’t know what to do 

I don’t have the hands spare to clean it up without my child getting in it, I can’t do this everyday. It’s becoming such a problem,

So I went ahead, found a shop, selling the same brand and all and bought 7 bags and to my disdain, they were mixed with Bentonite Clay.

The reason why I love using Tofu Cat Litter is because its flush able and all. There's stricter trash segregation laws in where I live, and sometimes, garbage trucks don't come for literal months to get our trash. Tofu Cat Litter is appealing to me because of how easy to clean it is.

I went back to the shop, and well turns out, the shop does in fact state that they do mix the cat litter with bentonite clay. 89% is Tofu Cat Litter and 11% is Bentonite (or so the product says). I simply just didn't pay attention, since I was more focused on searching for the same brand I liked. 

It's on me and I'll take the L on that one. But I'm still uncomfortable of using the cat litter, especially in the idea of flushing down bentonite down the toilet.

I have a problem with how he takes care of his cat. She gets food and water on somewhat of a schedule, and receives lots of cuddles (when she is open to receiving them). However, my brother never plays with “his cat” and she has destroyed a few household objects because of the lack of activity.

She also jumps and scratches and so if she isn’t distracted by play then she is with him in his room while he is on his laptop or phone. 

She meows and paws at the door a lot but he claims it’s just for “attention” and she doesn’t need nearly as much physical activity as I “think she does” even though I’ve done research and spoke with two animal behaviorists on this subject and he’s admitted to doing “no research,” but he still knows “better than” me.

The rest of the household plays with the cat when we can, but one member has an IDD and is scared of the cat because my brother doesn’t “believe in training” and won’t do anything for when she jumps on people except 1) tell the person she is jumping on that it’s not a big deal and 2) take her back to his room and do nothing to help her get her energy out.

TLDR: can a bouquet with lilies in it be on the table at dinner and then put away, with a cat in the house? Google is giving me mixed results. 

I have a cat and was gifted a thanksgiving bouquet centerpiece for dinner tomorrow as it’s hosted at my house. I looked at the bouquet and it’s full of lilies- tiger and natal. I know how poisonous they are to cats and have actively avoided them. The bouquet is now locked away in a room. He hasn’t touched it or gone near it. 

Is it safe to put the bouquet on the table tomorrow for dinner and then return it to the locked room? I have been reading mixed statements on google about exposure type/time and the correlation between poisoning. I will obviously get rid of the bouquet all together if it is deemed unsafe to have out on the table for a few hours- but want to try to be courteous as the people that gifted it to me will be at dinner.",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,118663,public,self,Lilies gifted in Thanksgiving centerpiece bouquet… what to do.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/z392iz/lilies_gifted_in_thanksgiving_centerpiece_bouquet/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

I currently live with my partner &amp; his 2 year old cat (Fork). I did my best to take things slow but my partner is a little less… cautious than I am, so they met fairly quickly and after a bit of hissing from Fork he quietened down. 

Now, my concern is this. Fork is a big cat and he’s not well socialised (in my opinion). He isn’t affectionate, rarely comes near us, is very shy in new situations, but is quite energetic. I do my best to play with him and provide him mental stimulation but he never tires. When he tries to “play” with the kitten he is quite rough and he also never leaves her alone. He follows her (and I) from room to room and completely fixated on her. When he approaches and tries to play/bop her, she doesn’t want to engage but he keeps going, chasing her around and getting rougher and rougher. 

Previously, my partner and Fork lived in a shared flat with an older cat who didn’t want anything to do with him but he would just follow her around and paw at her, never backing off even when she hissed at him. He wasn’t aggressive per se but it was almost like “how much can I annoy this other cat”.

I’m doing my best to reward Fork when he is gentle and “punish” him when he’s rough but separating them and closing the door, but I’m concerned he’s bullying her.

We currently have a 13 yr old domesticated neutered male who has been the only cat in his household. 

After introducing the two of them (slow intros, scent swapping, separate rooms, visual through gate), shelter cat started hissing at humans and now does not allow any human contact, swatting and biting us if we try. He has not really been improving, despite being extremely food motivated. He will eat near us, but runs away immediately after finishing his food/treats. 

The two cats have been hissing/meowing at each other and are very wary of each other, despite eating on opposite sides of the gate. We have installed pheromone diffusers and consulted many online resources to no avail.

It was freezing outside and he was soaking wet. I was actually going to the neighbours house (let’s call her Alison) and Alison told me that the owners leave this cat outside all the time. They don’t care for it and only use it for breeding to make money. She also told me that they have a female cat that they keep indoors but they’ve bred this cat around 7/8 times and the cat is 5 years old. My heart broke for them both and the male cat was so friendly, he kept trying to get inside my car and sit on my bonnet just for the engine warmth. Alison has rang the RSPCA and the local council multiple times but they haven’t done anything. I also rang RSPCA on the same day i saw him and i sent pictures of him to them and they still haven’t done anything yet. However, my problem is that it’s getting colder here in the UK and it’s only a matter of time before this poor cat dies from negelect. I personally don’t think anything’s going to be done about this so i’m seriously contemplating pulling up one day and just taking him. He needs serious vet attention and somewhere warm to recover. Alison told me that the cat isn’t microchipped or even flead and wormed, and the owners are very hostile so approaching them and asking them for the cat if they don’t want it is out of the question. 

Basically, I was wondering if I should actually take him? And what can i do to avoid getting caught? Because morally i just can’t leave that cat there to die.

If I ring the vet they'll most likely say bring my boy in but if I do that he gets very stressed and had cystitis in the past so I'm worried the stress will cause a flare up.

He is a 4 year old male on prescribed food for the previous issue of cystitis. He's a greedy boy too always face first in the bowl. He is a indoor cat so has not got hold of anything he shouldn't have.

He has had a upset tummy 3 days. First day he went and it was like soft serve and slightly yellow but not alarming. He then went twice more that evening and was pure liquid. 

Second day exactly the same as his first but this day he didn't eat all day. Also wasn't himself.

Ge started eating again yesterday smaller amounts but something. Yesterday it was just like soft serve and normal colour. 

Today he is eating a little still. Is much more himself, alert, playful, wants fuss. Even had 100 percent chicken breast treats. But he's been 3 times today. 2 times like soft serve but a little more put together. Then this evening so almost the 4th day now it was slightly yellow again, some formation but more liquid then earlier today. 

I'm not sure wether he's actually on the mend or I should take him up tomorrow. In himself he's doing better but the slightly worse last poo worries me.

Everytime he goes to the vet and for the whole journey he meows, shakes and pants. Then comes home and shakes for hours. 

Also money is a issue. I do have a little and I do have insurance but it's the kind you pay upfront and claim back. I can attach photos of poop but I'm not sure you'd want to see. 

Haven't seen him drink too much but he's had some and has been licking the gravy of his food.",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,118611,public,self,Upset tummy,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/z2vmfo/upset_tummy/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

I’ve been taking care of them with the hope of socializing them and giving them out for adoption. Their socialization process has been slow. I want to know when the right time to let them out into my bedroom is, their enclosure is in my bedroom. 

▪️(Female) Kitten 1 
Arrived October 25-
I started to let her out into the room 2 weeks ago but now I only let her out to sleep on the bed. When let out in my room, very playful and active on her own but gets scared easily and runs and hides when I walk into the room, when there’s sounds or sometimes if I move. Sometimes she’ll let me pet her but most of the time she won’t stay and will run off. Seems antsy to be loose in the room. Used to be cuddlier when she arrived. The one with the most progress, lets me pick her up most of the time when in the enclosure, sleeps on my bed but not very cuddly.  

▪️(Male) Kitten 2 
Arrived November 7- 
Has bitten me hard 3 times, they day he arrived and the day after a vet visit. This kitten has had the slowest progress of all three. He’ll stay on my lap to eat but will want off as soon as he’s done eating. I pet him when he eats. Usually doesn’t let me pet him when I reach in the enclosure. Does eat from my hand. Strong, if he runs I have to let him go, he’ll bite, wiggle and scratch otherwise. 

▪️(Female?) Kitten 3
Arrived November 15-I can pet her sometimes while she’s in the enclosure. Sometimes she watches me intently and up until recently, her eyes dilated most of the time I was near, not as much now, I look away. She’ll stay on my lap a little while after feeding and I’ll pet her. Will eat from my hand. 

➖They all seem to want to be out in the room and get really curious when kitten 1 is out but since I don’t know when the right time to introduce them to my bedroom is, I stopped letting Kitten 1 out.

A boy and a girl, they’re a little over a year old now.

Every time he does this he starts meowing and will find us wherever we are in the apartment and usually won’t stop until we make some acknowledgment of it. He never did this before we moved and our female cat doesn’t do this either. I’ve had cats most of my life and never experienced it, but this is the first time I’ve had fully indoor cats, so maybe that has something to do with it. It’s been increasing in frequency to the point that he does this almost every night. A few minutes after we get in bed, we’ll hear him start meowing and dragging the toy down the hall. About half the time he’ll jump on the bed to bring us the toy and once we say hi to him, he just lays down like normal. This happens occasionally (about every few days) during the day as well. It’s not a problem but I have also noticed that when he does this, he’ll sometimes make a motion kind of like he’s trying to cough up a hairball but doesn’t make any sound and doesn’t drop the toy when he does this.

Any tips on things I can do when I'm alone with her to try to get her out of this habit? I've been working on making it obvious that she hurt my hand if she bites too hard and will stop petting her and turn away from her and try to pet her again once she's calmed down, trying to reward her with affection when she let's me pet her without biting. 

This seems to be helping a little bit maybe, but it's hard to tell since I don't have guests over very often.

So my cat Blue is a very well behaved boy and I trained him to go to the toilet outside when he was little with no problems.

I moved house in August and kept him in for 6 weeks with his litter tray. When he started going outside, I got a cat flap fitted and naturally he started finding an outside loo and I took the litter tray away. 

There are some new big bully cats he’s had a few stand offs with and now he’s a bit afraid of going outside, even nipping out to the toilet. He’ll go if I’m out there with him, but I can’t always keep an eye on when he might need to go, and I’m not always in.

I started trying to associate the outside with “good things” so would give him his breakfast outside and sit with him, and have also been hiding treats around the patio which generally keeps him entertained. 

However in the last couple of weeks,  his go-to before he even thinks to go outside is finding corners in the house to go to the toilet. It’s very frustrating for obvious reasons, and this morning I have had to reinstate the litter tray because it’s become such a regular occurrence and I don’t trust him in the house anymore. It doesn’t help that it’s very rainy where I live which is an extra reason he doesn’t always want to go outside. 

I don’t want to have a litter tray forever, and feel like we’re regressing! Has anyone experienced this and have any tips/advice for retraining your cat to go outside / rebuilding lost confidence?

Within the last days I have seen the RSPCA visiting her yet so I know 100% they are her animals yet nothing has changed. I’ve never been in this situation before and certainly didn’t want to ‘steal’ anyones cats but I could not let poor harmless cats suffer. Now I’ve been looking after the cats the past nearly 6 months they’ve grown on me as a person who has mainly been a dog person previously.

My oldest cat I've had for five years, then there's the ""outside cat"" I took with me who is three years old. Then I have a young one who is only a year and a half. My young one is the kitten of the ""outside cat"" and has been indoors since she was old enough to be separated as I somehow convinced my parents to let her in.

So, the problem is I moved to a new place four days ago and my youngest cat went into shock mode. She stopped eating and was hiding which is very unlike her. She's an energetically playful cat and very, very food motivated so it's depressing to see her like this. She's slowly coming around but her playful energy hasn't been restored and I'm fearful she might be lonely during the day while I'm at work. My apartment is also in a big complex so there are little noises here and there too that she seems to be sensitive to; my parents live in a rural country home with no background noise.

She loves the other two cats, but I think she misses my parents more than anything. My dad gave her a lot of attention and he's retired, so he was home with her all day. Both my parents are not cat people but they love her and practically begged me to let them keep her. Now that she's with me, I'm having doubts on whether or not it's right for me to have her. She doesn't seem like herself and I know she'd probably be happier in her old home with somebody who will be with her all day. But then again, I've had her since she was born and I also love her a lot and would miss her.

Would it be better to bring her back to my parents or keep her? I've been an emotional wreck and so conflicted over this because I don't want to give her up but I want what's best for her. I really want more opinions to help me come to a concrete decision; I know cats are sensitive to change so if I choose to bring her back, I would want to do it soon so that I don't further traumatize her.

Also, for reference, I live two hours away from my parents and would not be able to see her often. Hence, why this is such a big decision for me.",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,118507,public,self,Should I surrender my cat or not?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/z2auio/should_i_surrender_my_cat_or_not/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

He tries to come inside and meows by my back door. Hes always hungry, and ive noticed more and more fight wounds on his face in that time as well.  It's also really cold here, maybe high 30s in the day and down to 19 or less at night. Way too cold for him to be outside for hours at a time. 
I feel so bad for the cat, he just comes and meows and scratches at my door. He even has followed me on a walk yesterday and came home with me. 
I almost get this vibe my neighbor is hoping he will just ""disappear"", because he never let hin roam around like this before. Hes also a very unique breed and very friendly, I'm surprised he hasn't been taken yet.
So what can I do? I thought maybe writing a note , but honesty I don't know how to approach it.i totally have considered just keeping the cat. I love the cat, and he's welcome here.

My partner, and I recently took in a 6yr old cat(D) from a rehoming situation. We already had our current 7yr old cat(R). R suffers from feline herpes, and has always been on a grain free diet to help with those symptoms(whether it does or not is another question in itself, feel free to voice your thoughts.) D suffers from urinary issues, and came to us with urinary care dry food that he never seemed to avoid, and ate R's dry food. We have since switched him to R's dry food, and put him on Authority Urinary Care wet food for this reason. R's wet food is Purina Beyond grain free, and the current dry is Purina One True Instinct grain free.

We are looking to switch their foods to something to possibly help with weight loss for R, as he is overweight. We don't have any concerns with D's issues, and wouldn't consider him overweight by any means but he definitely could make his way to being a chonker very easily. An option we have found is Authority Hairball Control + Weight Management dry food. They also make a wet Healthy Weight food.

My question I guess is... are we better to switch R's wet food to the Healthy Weight stuff, and leave them both on current dry food... Switch R over to the Authority wet/dry weight food, but also give D the new dry food!? OR just switch the dry food for both, and leave R on his current wet food.

Is there better options for weight wet/dry out there? That was the best budget friendly option we could find. Hills was an option but is on the higher end of budget range.

It's also really cold here, maybe high 30s in the day and down to 19 or less at night. Way too cold for him to be outside for hours at a time. 
I feel so bad for the cat, he just comes and meows and scratches at my door. He even has followed me on a walk yesterday and came home with me. 
I almost get this vibe my neighbor is hoping he will just ""disappear"", because he never let hin roam around like this before. Hes also a very unique breed and very friendly, I'm surprised he hasn't been taken yet.

My partner, and I recently took in a 6yr old cat(D) from a rehoming situation. We already had our current 7yr old cat(R). R suffers from feline herpes, and has always been on a grain free diet to help with those symptoms(whether it does or not is another question in itself, feel free to voice your thoughts.) D suffers from urinary issues, and came to us with urinary care dry food that he never seemed to avoid, and ate R's dry food. We have since switched him to R's dry food, and put him on Authority Urinary Care wet food for this reason. R's wet food is Purina Beyond grain free, and the current dry is Purina One True Instinct grain free.

We are looking to switch their foods to something to possibly help with weight loss for R, as he is overweight. We don't have any concerns with D's issues, and wouldn't consider him overweight by any means but he definitely could make his way to being a chonker very easily. An option we have found is Authority Hairball Control + Weight Management dry food. They also make a wet Healthy Weight food.

My question I guess is... are we better to switch R's wet food to the Healthy Weight stuff, and leave them both on current dry food... Switch R over to the Authority wet/dry weight food, but also give D the new dry food!? OR just switch the dry food for both, and leave R on his current wet food.

Is there better options for weight wet/dry out there? That was the best budget friendly option we could find. Hills was an option but is on the higher end of budget range.

I will be referring to them by number they were adopted so number 1 is the oldest and 3 is the youngest! 

Number 1 came home as a 3.5 month old kitten almost two years ago. When we brought home number 2 a few months later, it was like soulmates meeting for the first time! They loved each other immediately and have been inseparable ever since so I thought a new kitten wouldn’t be much of an issue.

Fast forward to now and I’ve completely fallen in love with a new kitten and have brought him home. We did the slow introduction, scent swapping, feeding together, and playing together (only positive experiences). There were green flags the whole way through. Not a single hiss or swat. Number 1 was playing with the new baby and zooming around like a kitten again. Now I thought they must be ready to sleep all together last night but number one went completely Mr. Hyde, hissing and swatting like he’d never seen this cat before! (Mind you they were snuggling on the couch just an hour before). He even swatted at number 2, something he normally would never do.

I have a strong inkling he’s possessive of our bed, or maybe he’s possessive of snuggling with me? He’s normally the cuddler and number 2 lays by my feet so there’s never been a rift before. Last night he was being insufferable so I put him in our guest room to sleep. And now this morning, him and number 3 are all good once again! 

I guess my big question is what can I do to benefit all parties? I don’t want to sleep without the baby because I don’t want him being alone, and I don’t want to encourage inappropriate urination for number 1 because I’m alienating him.

They've never actually fought outright, but light swatting and growling is common at the end of a chase...

The thing is they can go a day or more getting along and then just start. We have a camera up to record and cannot find a trigger, although the stairs in the house seem to be the area where conflict usually starts.

We are not sure if these are play attempts, something we need to let happen on occasion so they can sort hierarchy, or what to do. FWIW we did just leave it for a weekend and while it did keep happening it didn't escalate.

Note: they are separated at all times if we cannot be there to watch them.

As a side note to this we are really struggling with rewards for the Maine Coon. She has no interest in any sort of cat treats but will absolutely try her luck at stealing chocolate and sweets if they are not watched, so any advice for appropriate sweet treats would be great.

We decided to get a lot of wardrobes in our hallway. During the first weeks we didn’t have still the doors mounted on them and guess what… our cat found in them the perfect spots to hide and sleep.
Few weeks ago we mounted the doors on the wardrobes and from then the cat every morning at 5am or so, starts to meowing in front of these doors, and beat his paws very loud against that, he is also very stubborn and goes on for hours till we “wake up” at 7.30am. We can’t sleep and I’m also worried that his loud meowing disturbs the neighbours.
My assumptions is that my cat thinks the wardorbe interior is his territory and he needs to have access to it. I really don’t want him to have access or start a new habit and getting up to open the doors at his demand.
Of course he has all the comforts, scratch tree, interactive toys, full access to all the house (except wardrobes’ interior).

She’s about 3-4 years old. A simple black cat. I had her since i was 19. We had a struggle of life (don’t we all) but we’re making it work as best as we can. her behaviors have been changing recently. i made a post a while ago asking about her eating habits and why they changed. 


She just seems so depressed. My gf suggest my cat is reflecting my mood and energy. Cats are pretty reflective on that. But I don’t know, I don’t believe she is. 


I don’t have any money or transportation to get her to a vet or even have a consistent doctor for her, that makes me feel like shit. I was recently unemployed, but I have an interview set up. I want to give her a good life. I understand my apartment unit is shit and i don’t have an open window or balcony for her. It makes me feel so terrible. I let her roam my apartment hallways when she begs. I let her drink water from the sink. I change and specifically get her turkey pate and wet food. I change my tone when talking to her. I started playing with her more. I don’t even know if she’s gaining or losing weight.  I’m doing the best I can with my deliberating mental/emotional health. 


My perception of all of it really dark and bad. Maybe she’s not dying. Maybe she’s perfectly fine. But to me, I feel as though I’m failing her in every way as a cat father and her best friend. I really don’t know what to do. The other cat I have is doing fine. He eats, plays, and reflective positive energy. He just existing really. 


But Kota? I have no idea what to do, where I went wrong, maybe it my fault for always being broke. I need to do better. I feel like such a failure. I lm fearful of waking up this week and finding her dead. I’m at loss. And I know cats hide themselves when they’re sick or near death, and to me , it seems like she’s hiding or been sleeping in really hidden spots or just on top of this soft blanket I have.

So we wanna know how to take care of them.

None of us has ever took care of any pet so we don't have any idea on how to take care of them so a thorough guide will be helpful.

We don't know their age or anything about it or how to make them comfortable or what to feed them so pls help us.

And pls try to keep the supplies in a tight budget as we are just some teenagers.

She's groomed the back of her front legs naked, I thought someone shaved the backs of them at first only to learn its from overgrooming.  I would've never guessed she was so lonely well I was gone because she's not any clingier when I'm at home, she's always super excited when I get home almost like a dog but she just kinda comes and goes for attention well I'm home.

I've been told I should get her a friend, but she's not meshed well with other cats. Her old owner rehomed her because she was bullying the new kitten they got and well my grandma was staying with us she and my grandma's cat didn't get along. She wasn't slowly introduced to either of the new cats so I'm wondering if we go slow it'd be different? 

My local shelter will let you ""trail run"" adoptions to see if they get along before finalizing so I'm debating on trying that.

Any tips or ideas appreciated.

""At the recommendation of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), American Airlines will not accept household dogs and cats that have been sedated or tranquilized. Pets that have been given sedatives or tranquilizers are at a higher risk of respiratory and cardiovascular problems at high altitudes.""

I know it is not a tranquilizer, but is gabapentin a sedative? I absolutely do not want to put my cats at risk. Can anyone help me find a resource that has additional information to clarify if gabapentin is a sedative and/or if it poses these risks?

We made the mistake of letting them meet right away. While there was no aggression (towards eachother), they were visibly uneasy. 

Both cats are quite docile, although Max is definitely more sensitive and can get stressed by unfamiliar people or change. Felix is very adaptable and easy-going; he's enjoyed socializing with my parents and exploring the house. He was very submissive and hesitant around Max when they met, and just kept his distance.

But to my surprise, Max was aggressive towards ME. Despite how they were only in the same room together for about 10 minutes (with no conflict), when I later tried to talk to/pet him, he growled, hissed, and even swatted at me. He hissed at my parents too when they tried, but he was significantly more aggressive towards me. 

It breaks my heart because he used to LOVE me, and I'm worried  that he might resent me now?

I have two cats, and recently started fostering a third cat. Our kitten, around 8mo, was rescued from a feral mother. She is very food motivated, which has historically made it super easy to train her to get used to things, but I am having trouble with how she interacts with the foster cat.

Half the time, she will completely ignore him - running past him to get into a room, or sharing a space with general disinterest. She is very treat motivated, and will nearly crawl \_under\_ the foster cat to get treats. She isn't defensive about it or anything, they just happily eat treats next to each other. She doesn't seem very smart.

However, our kitten will also chase him around the house, cornering him under tables, watching him like a hawk. She will hiss and sputter and take swings at him occasionally - it does not seem like play behavior and the foster cat definitely isn't reading it as such.

I'm not sure how to disincentivize her from picking fights. The foster cat is much bigger than her, I'm not worried about his safety that much, but he is also a sweet guy who clearly does not want to fight. He would much rather flee.

I have a one year old cat who occasionally (once or twice a day) will pee outside of her litter box. She is spayed and according to her vet is healthy. She usually pees in front of doors, like the bathroom door if it is closed or my roommate's door or even the front door even though she does not like the outside. I've been trying to combat the issue by making sure to take her with me when I use the bathroom and my roommate is trying to do the same but recently I went on a trip and had to leave my cat with my roommate and the peeing got worse so now I'm looking for a long-term solution. 

The peeing started about a month after I adopted her (which would be march 2022). Around the same time she fell the bathtub while I was taking a bath. I don't know how significant of an incident it was but the peeing started around the same time. She isn't that squeemish of water nowadays so I don't think that is the reason for it. Also, my roommate moved in a little while after that. 

Here are the solutions I already tried:

1- Taking her with me to the bathroom and keeping doors open (which isn't always possible). 

2- Putting her in the litterbox after meals and after she sleeps. Works somewhat well, except for when I am at work or at night (so half of the time).

3- Changing litters. I use a clumping small pellet litter, which is what vets recommend for these kinds of issues. I scoop multiple times every day and change out the litter every month.

4- Changing her food. She gets wet food each morning and dry food throughout the day. Don't know what else I could do about that. 

She is overall a somewhat nervous cat. She will usually meow outside our doors whenever we close them and meow when we come back from the outside. I've also very briefly given Feliway (the spray version) a try and it seemed to work but I've read very mixed reviews and I wanted to ask here before committing to it. 

At this point I'm pretty desparate to solve this issue and would be open to any suggestions. If you have any questions or need more information, please ask.

I know the new owner somewhat; we are coworkers &amp; I trust he will take good care of her, better than I can, &amp; ik she will end up being happier with him. It's the right thing to do but does anyone have advice for things I can do to make the transition better?

She gave birth to her first kitten 2 and half months ago. And just like any other mother cats, she was very protective and caring during the first few weeks. Won't let anyone touch/carry her kitten, hide her from us, etc. After 2 months, she's not protective anymore and the kitten is now basically a young cat that is now independent from the mother. 

Of course, these are all very normal but the weird thing is what's happening now. The mother cat gave birth to two new kittens this week. As normal, she's again being very caring and protective of the new kittens. 

But what's weird is that she became over protective again of the first cat. When she's away from her, she would come and pick her up by her neck or ear even though they're almost the same size now and would try to bring her back together with the two new kittens. 

Whenever we try to carry and play with the older kitten, the mother cat would come to us and would try to take her away. It's as if she thinks the older kitten is part of the newborns and her protective maternal instinct for the older cat got renewed? 

Just like other young cats, the first kitten is now very playful and keeps on running around. However, I think this is stressing the mother cat so much as she would always try to bring her back.

I'm thinking of getting the older kitten away from the mother in the meantime while she's still nursing the newborns?

It has been about a month now and I've successfully been able to socialize her (although she still is a bit skittish) so now I'm starting the process of introducing her to my resident cat, Peaches.

Peaches is 5yrs old and my most beloved nightmare lol She I describe her as the poster child of ""single kitten syndrome"" and I have barely been able to improve her play aggression for the 4yrs I've had her 🥲 She still has the energy of a kitten, and I was contemplating getting her a kitten next year to maybe reduce the violent attacks on my legs, but hey! That's when Basil showed up!

I'm following Jackson Galaxy's method of introducing cats, but these two have accidentally come face to face before-- when I first trapped the kitten and was clearing a bathroom, I accidentally didn't shut the door right and they briefly sniffed each other's noses before I shooed Peaches away. Note that this is a shockingly good cat interaction for Peaches bc if she faces a cat outdoors through a window she typically screams like she's dying. The 2nd time they interacted was again, bc I'm terrible at shutting doors. I entered my office (where kitten is kept) to find Peaches staring intensely at the kitten like she was shocked that this creature was still here lol This time Peaches did hiss when she was picked up, but I think that's more because she was startled 😅

Now, this is where I am getting mixed signals. Room swapping? Not a problem; Peaches sniffed around at first but then just carried on with life. And it's the same thing with feeding on either side of the door! Peaches has no qualms with eating her food with Basil's bowl right up near her-- Peaches actually eats faster than the kitten, and when she's done eating she just walks away as usual! BUT the kitten recently discovered that she can fit her little paws underneath the door, and if Peaches sees her little paw, it's an immediate big hiss 😭? Idk how she can be okay with all the other steps day one, but a little paw and it's game over??

I feel bad for the kitten, bc she really wants to play with Peaches and will try to door-dash if she notices Peaches (Peaches does not notice her bc she is busy begging for the food I bring the kitten lol). Do I move on to the next step of eating with only a screen (or in this case, through the mesh of Basil's giant play pen) or is this a sign that things are going sour?

I'm super worried bc I'll be visiting my parents in a month and Peaches comes with me for that, but this time kitten will have to come with me too! I was so hoping Peaches would be more accepting of a baby cat but alas she still hates poor lil Basil 😢

He was the only kitten in the RSPCA enclosure who didn't run when he saw my 43 kg (95 lb) dog Isaac approach, and they were best friends within 10 minutes at home. Ivy goes right up to people when they visit, whether strangers or otherwise, loves pats from everyone. Goes for harnessed walks, even hangs out the car window on trips (harnessed to belt buckle, I promise). So he's a dog cat really. Adventurous, affectionate, smart, curious.

At home, it's been just Ivy and Isaac (who cuddle together all the time and play together occassionally), plus a house rabbit (Ivy would sometimes bully her during play but otherwise they left each other alone), who has since passed of old age. Ivy is an indoor cat but he's allowed access to a cat enclosure thing that allows him to go right to the fence. There, he calls SUPER loudly to the neighbour's cat to play and can often get quite upset when she doesn't show up.

His only semi extended interaction with a cat was when I recently took care of my friend's 1 year old shy female cat named Nyx for a week. Ivy was always very curious, patient, desperate to play but gave Nyx her space. They never quite got to cuddle levels because Nyx was very standoffish, but Ivy came close to winning her over. And Ivy was utterly heartbroken when the week was over and Nyx went back home. He wandered around the apartment looking dejected for a whole day. And he still goes to the fence daily for some cat interaction, which he doesn't always get.

My question is whether these are all signs that I should adopt another cat. I've read a lot of articles and posts warning about the difficulties, but in those cases, it seemed to be with a cat who was being introduced to another cat for the first time. So I was hoping for some tailored advice about my situation. Does the fact that Ivy seems to crave cat interaction mean I'll have a better chance of making a cat pair work? Would it be cruel not to try? (Okay ""cruel"" is a bit dramatic, but you know what I mean.) Even though Ivy is enthusiastic about a new cat friend now, will this fade over time and is there a chance they'll just get into fights later? Is Ivy and Isaac's occasional playtime enough to satisfy him?

For those who vote yes adopt another cat, any advice about age/sex etc? I personally think Ivy is a bit of a ladies' man and would love a female companion around his age, but I'm open to suggestions.

I would honestly prefer not to adopt another cat right now because I live in a small two-bedroom apartment with a giant dog and a cat, so I'd struggle for space. And the idea of adopting a cat only to find that it won't work out is quite stressful. But it also breaks my heart to hear Ivy calling out to the neighbour's cat to play and getting no response.

As a compromise, I was actually thinking of waiting until Isaac passes, since he's quite old, and adopting another cat then, to help both Ivy and myself grieve. This may not happen for several years, however, and I do feel bad for Ivy in the meantime.

Thanks to anyone who read through all that! Would love some advice from experienced cat owners tailored to my situation.",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,118248,public,self,Should I get a second cat (for my very adventurous and affectionate cat)?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/z0hvxo/should_i_get_a_second_cat_for_my_very_adventurous/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

The problem now is Romeo with his kitten levels of energy is a little too crazy. He sprints full speed and attempts to mount both rick and cheeto on sight every day and every opportunity he gets. Rick is a stronger, more “alpha” cat while cheeto is the definition of a scaredy cat, pretty weak, innocent and affectionate which im totally fine with.

My problem is my other cats are starting to slightly change and I can tell sometimes they are distressed. My main concern is cheeto because romeo can smell the weakness off cheeto and enjoys what id consider bullying cheeto. Sometimes I catch him just growling when romeo is in the vicinity. I understand its the age difference and energy levels which contribute to the incompatibility but my family is starting to get annoyed and although they like romeo, due to his behavior they dont like him as much as the other cats because of his behavior. I can live with them not really playing with romeo as my family doesnt really know what goes into cat owner ship but I play with romeo 2 hours a day and it’s difficult playing with him that much just for his energy levels to be at 90% and launch at my other cats. Cheeto yelps is very vocal as he’s being chased as he runs and Rick play fights with romeo One out of every 10 times Romeo chases him. But when Rick is hissing telling him to f off essentially romeo doesnt stop, same with cheeto. Romeo always tries to bite the back of Rick‘s leg near his butt and it looks like Rick is really bothered by it.

I really need romeo to take it at least one step back and not bully my other cats. I really feel that romeo knows what hes doing is bad but he gets off to it. How do I get him to stop attacking cheeto on sight? I understand kittens are crazy but I think hes taking it too far. I keep cheeto in our big/nice basement with all his necessities with the door to upstairs closed as he spends most of his time down there anyway. 
It’s really difficult doing this on my own and I don’t want my family to continue being annoyed with him. I don’t know where to find a professional behaviourist or at least a reliable one. Will neutering Romeo bring this behaviour down a notch?

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you so much

My significant other and her sister recently adopted a stray kitten 2 months ago. They've separated the kitten to be downstairs and their 6 year old cat upstairs.

They feel bad their older cat can't explore the house like she used to so they've tried bringing her downstairs (when the kitten isn't around) to explore but she's just constantly meowing. It's sounding like a sad meow too. Is there anything that can be down to help calm down when she's downstairs and explore more?

Any information would be very helpful!

I keep cheeto in our big/nice basement with all his necessities with the door to upstairs closed as he spends most of his time down there anyway. 
It’s really difficult doing this on my own and I don’t want my family to continue being annoyed with him. I don’t know where to find a professional behaviourist or at least a reliable one. Will neutering Romeo bring this behaviour down a notch?

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you so much

TLDR: five month old kitten aggresively play attacks other three and four-year-old cats on site and I can tell they’re not enjoying it because they run and hiss and the 5 month old doesnt stop.

My significant other and her sister recently adopted a stray kitten 2 months ago. They've separated the kitten to be downstairs and their 6 year old cat upstairs.

They feel bad their older cat can't explore the house like she used to so they've tried bringing her downstairs (when the kitten isn't around) to explore but she's just constantly meowing. It's sounding like a sad meow too. Is there anything that can be down to help calm down when she's downstairs and explore more?

Any information would be very helpful!

I have a shelf in my room where I grow some plants under a grow light (there is no window!!) and he's become hellbent on getting up there--probably because he knows it gets my attention. I've done everything in my power to block off the shelf, and he still barges through it all, even if he falls or it's nearly impossible to make the jump. When I remove him from successful attempts, he finds something in my room other than the Two Whole Litter Boxes in the room to pee on. 

He's gotten along great with the other three cats, even plays with the younger two regularly. I thought he was doing this because he was restless, so I started playing hard with him before bed. Then I thought he was obsessed with the shelf because I kept the cat food in the cabinet, so I moved it out of the room. Finally  because he ended up getting up earlier than me, I decided to start opening my room door so he could go downstairs with the other cats while I finish sleeping. Nope, he still comes back in and tries to get up there, and once more when I remove him, he guns straight for my closet or chair to piss on something.

I'm at the end of my rope. I'm writing this after being woken up by him jumping up there AGAIN, and I've shut him out before I boot him from here to the moon, but that's not a long term strat either because my other cats favourite litter box is in here. I honestly do not know how to manage this behaviour, and any advice would be great before I wring his skinny little neck (this is hyperbole, I would never harm any of them, but boy does he fucking test me)

Feel free to ask for more details, too. If it's relevant, I suspect he's albino and he certainly seems to have some vision issues.

Manju (Mauhn-Jew) • Male • 18 months • Feral • had since four months old • adopted Sep. 19. 2021 (First Kitty)

Peanut is Butter • Female • 20 months • Spaded • had since 6 months old • adopted Oct. 11. 2021 (Second Kitty)
 
Fae • Female • 14 months • Spaded • had since 13 months old • adopted Oct. 14. 2022 (Our New Kitty)

Midnight • Neighbors cat who is always at our house, eats &amp; sleeps here most of her time • Female • about 8 months old • Unsure about being Spaded • Neighbor found her at 2 weeks old, been coming here since four months old • (Not ours but came in as Third Kitty) 

So our new kitty, who we had for a little more than a month, keeps being bullied terrorized by our first cat Manju. Manju is usually the most friendliest of all cats, &amp; of all the cats we thought Manju would be the first person to take to her, but he wasn’t. Everytime he sees her, he makes his shoulders big &amp; turn into a gorilla &amp; chases her down looking like he has gorilla shoulders &amp; smacks her, with claws. I’m not joking, he actually resembles a gorilla. i know it’s him showing dominance. My bestfriend says he’s getting “bigger” because she made him feel “small” when he was trying to get to know her.

in reality, i know I made a few mistakes when introducing.

1. Fae was in the house when Manju was outside laying &amp; playing around (gone) with the other cats in the backyard. so he wasn’t home when she arrived.
2. I wasn’t aware of Fae’s personality before I adopted her. now i do see that plays a big major role. (learned alot of lessons this last adoption) her personality is very scary. Like she’s extremely scared of everything. i think before the person she was adopted from. (it was an older lady who had Fae since about 7 months, so she had her for about 6 months before we adopted her, said that Fae is the only cat she was allergic to &amp; had to give her away but didn’t want to surrender her to a shelter. after she gave Fae to us, she got a new cat the following week &amp; says that she’s not allergic to this one.) Fae doesn’t really have any extremely concerning behavior issues, but she is scared of everything. When Manju is out the house, she free roams, smells everyone’s butts weirdly a lot, loves to play, loves to be pet, doesn’t really socialize a lot , very to herself most of the time, all movements &amp; noises scare her. I think before the last woman, she was somewhere where she had to fend for herself &amp; it was dangerous. I would say, most times it’s not dangerous in our house but it does get a little worrysome whenever Manju wants to attack her. This happens about 2-3 a day. 
3. When Manju met Fae, for two days he would go up to her sniff her &amp; always lay by her. Later on the second day, he was smelling her face again, she hissed at him, swatted him &amp; ever since then he’s been going gorrilla mode every single time he sees her.

Peanut Butter doesn’t really care about Fae too much, Manju hates her, Midnight plays with her a lot &amp; Fae plays back but Fae body slams her a lot &amp; Fae plays extremely hard, so I’m always confused if they are playing or it’s serious. 

All of the other cats go outside, lay in the sun, climb the trees, lay on our roofs, play in the grass, &amp; Fae watches them from the window all the time. Fae is too scared to go outside. 

I feel like is Fae wasn’t as scared &amp; more free flowing she would have gotten along well with everyone but She’s extremely scared. Now I feel like she’s found herself in an environment, that she’s not always getting attacked but it does happen. She definitely feels happier when everyone’s outside because she freeroams, She’s free roaming the house when Manju is outside, &amp; the other cats are inside.

But i’m reality, i’m just concerned &amp; dk what to do. I’ve tried to get them both to accept eachother, but Fae will just swat at him when he isn’t doing anything &amp; he’ll turn into a fucking gorilla &amp; swat her when he sees her. 

Honestly i feel like she’ll do better in a home where there’s no other cats. but i also don’t want her to just be passed around because she’s been going home to home but now in my home, she’s not fully safe whenever Manju decides he just wants to go gorilla.

I would love to find a solution to how to make them co-exist but i’m starting to feel like it’ll just be better to give her to someone who can provide a better home for her, a safer home.",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,118185,public,self,HELP!

Anyways, I'm two and half months into my semester abroad, and will be back in the middle of December. My cat has been staying at home with my roommates the entire time, because I couldn't take him with me and also didn't want to put the stress of moving on him. My roommates have been caring for him perfectly and also send me pictures every week or so. I'm not worried at all about him not being cared for. What I *am* worried about is him just completely forgetting about me. 
He's a typical ""covid baby""; he was born during the first year of the pandemic and as a consequence I was stuck at home with him for the first few months, meaning he's very used to me being there for him *all the time*. In the past, my roommates have said that when I leave for my parents' for a weekend or so, he will scream for me for a day before finally calming down. As soon as I came back, he'd be at the front door, screaming for me and checking I'm okay before ignoring me for a day or two (out of spite? I don't know why he does that, but it always felt like a ""you ignored me and left me here for *so long*, so now I am going to ignore *you*!"").

I need some advice on how to plan for my 2 cats while I’m away on a month long trip back at my parents’ in India (jan-feb). I currently live in Ontario Canada. I have 2 cats - 2.5 and 1.5 year old male neutered. I am speaking to friends as well but in case they cant watch them i need to plan for a backup option. My brother was supposed to watch them but he may he starting a job in another city. I have a roommate too and she has been good to feed them sometimes but she goes to stay with her bf sometimes and she may not be down to look after them religiously for a month. She also works 12 hours a day on the weekends. 
If boarding them with my friends or my brother doesnt work out, my plan is to get a house visit 1 or twice a day (from Rover) to feed them and pick up their litter. They might get some human interaction n will get to stay in their home instead of being relocated. Is this too less for a month?

Whenever I came back I would find him being taken care of by these 2 kids down the street and bring him home.

One day in the cold of winter  I came back to my Mom's and went down to the kid's house and he wasn't there, I haven't seen him since.

It's been a little over a year now and I've been wanting another cat, I don't want to make the same mistake again--so I thought of just taking them with me.

My fiance and I adopted two kittens back in June, one was 8 months old (Brown Tabby), the other (lynx point Siamese domesticated mix), 6 months. I sit here watching our two girls groom each other as inspiration for this post. 

We visited our local shelter back in June and fell in love with these two kittens. While they both came from Texas, they never actually interacted and obviously came from different litters. 

I see people here say that it takes days to weeks to introduce cats. Well...we didn't wait, and did not ease into it at all. We were going to, but just felt as if we didn't need to. 

When we brought them home into our home, we put their cages face to face for about 30 seconds. Then, we let them out of their cages. They sniffed each other, and within, without exaggeration, a minute, they were chasing, tumbling, playing and clearly having a blast and were obviously enjoying socializing. The tabby gave a quick hiss after about 10 minutes...the other kitten respected the boundary, sat for a bit, then they continued playing. They got along so well, that we felt okay leaving them alone in a room together over night! 

We woke up the next morning for work to find them cuddling. Fast forward 5 months, and nothing has changed. They love each other and are the best of friends. They still play and tumble and chase and groom. The tabby will usually give a hiss when she doesn't want to play, and the Siamese mix always respects the boundary and there's never been any hard feelings. 

As I read more about this, I see most people take weeks to introduce their cats. Maybe we weren't wise to introduce them immediately, but I've never seen two cats get along like this.

I have a large dog that is very cat friendly, but I’m waiting to introduce them for now. The dog is upstairs and the kitten is downstairs. No chance of running into each other.

The kitten is eating, but hasn’t used the litter box yet. The person I got him from said that he is litter trained, so I just hope that he uses it when he has to go.

But I am hoping for some advice on how to interact with him. How can I make him feel safe and encourage him to be less skittish? I’m fine with being patient, but I don’t want him to be more stressed then he has to be.

Hi,

A friend of mine has a neighbor with an 8 year old male cat who has not been using his litter box for a few months and has been relieving himself on the sofa, in his cat carrier, etc. instead. He's only recently started doing so for about two months, although he's been house-trained and had been good about using the litter box until then. They took him to the vet to get him checked out health-wise--apparently he's fine, and the vet suggested that there may be an environmental factor. The neighbor is an elderly lady who has some dementia issues, so it's likely that she had been unable to properly take care of him. They've also reached out to the local cat rescue agency, but they want the cat to be chipped and fully vaccinated before taking him in. The elderly lady wasn't sure of how many vaccines the cat had received and likely does not have enough money to pay for getting him chipped, etc.

I'm considering taking in the cat to see if he can fare better in a less chaotic situation, but wanted to ask for advice on how to prepare myself in taking in a likely very stressed out cat with litter box issues (Aka, how to prepare him to get adjusted to the new stressors of moving, what things would be best to entice him to use the litter box, what materials would be best to clean cat waste, etc.). I would also be happy to hear of any other potential avenues forward for this kitty.

Any and all help would be appreciated!

I gave her the miralax for a few months and but discontinued, concerned about the side effects of long time use, and there has been no change in her stool or coughing since stopping. I feel like my vet could have put a bandaid on things and that a food allergy could still be an underlying issue. Sharing these details in case anyone here has been through something similar.

I'd really like it since he still likes to go outside even though it's freezing and there's a lot of snow. He's good for coming back in time for his insulin shots, but I still would like him to have a shelter outside so he can stay out as long as he would like (and because sometimes he runs out when were not careful, even if it's not the best time for him to be outside).

I will be traveling for 3 weeks for Christmas and the New Year via a 3-hour flight. I originally planned to bring my cat with, then changed my mind and thought it would be better to get a sitter. Well, a sitter for that long is a big charge and I haven't even been able to find someone willing to watch him during the dates. I am traveling to visit my parents, who have two golden retrievers. I don't think my cat has ever been around dogs before. My plan was to keep him in my room but he would hear the dogs crying from outside the door. I am so torn on what to do. Is it better to board him somewhere near my apartment than to take him on a flight to a new place? Or keep him with me so he has some sense of normalcy? I don't want the poor guy to feel abandoned.

For context-- I got my cat at the end of August, he was very skittish (and still can be). He recently started head butting and asking to be pet which is amazing progress. I'm terrified of bringing him on a plane to a new place for only three weeks and ruining all of the progress we've made.

I feel terrible ignoring the cat, I love the cat, but I'm worried the cat will be a terror to my ex after he moves out. How do I make this process easier?

Rambling version: My ex and I split after 7 yrs (amicable) and we have 3 cats (all fixed). 

2 (male and female) are mine from before we started dating, 1 (male) is his who we got as a kitten 2 yrs ago. His cat LOVES me. Constantly cries for me to play with him. Gets destructive if I don't. Extremely high energy boy, needs a lot of exercise and play. One of the smartest cats I've had in my life. 

Recently I stopped playing with him, and instead I tell my ex he needs to play with his cat (which he does, but usually distracted by his phone or only for 5 mins at a time, so cat comes to me after). I'm trying to ""wean"" the cat off of me so that he isn't a destructive terror when my ex moves and it's just them. 

I feel absolutely terrible though. I love this kitty and it breaks my heart to hear him crying all the time. I can't tell if I'm doing the right thing or not. Should I be separating myself from the cat, or should I just keep giving him attention as normal?

Due to some unfortunate circumstances we were forced to leave said 3rd home and in doing so my family had split apart and started doing their own things. From this event I had to move very very suddenly into my new home (of which my room is miniscule and is the only room Rocky can be in, explanation for this further down). Here is some backstory on my new home and the animals that live here. 

     So during Rocky's first 3-4 years of life he was steadily gaining privilege to go outside unsupervised. (I live in coyote and raccoon territory and God knows what else, so I had trained him to come back into my home before dark and to let him out after dawn for his further safety.) Now I will introduce 2 other cats that are a large issue, A older but 1.5x larger cat than Rocky, named Buddy, and another 1.25x larger black cat named Jet (Rocky is about 12.5lbs for reference as to these cats sizes). These 2 would always antagonize Rocky whilst he was outside so they absolutely hate each other.

      Now to where this all comes together, so the home I was forced to move into, the lady/roommate/landlord Kim owns 1 dog and somewhere between 7-9 different cats. 2 of those also happen to be Buddy and Jet. So from this sudden move into a shoebox sized room with my indoor with outdoor privileges cat where I am near forced to contain him solely to my room. He has been neutered as well and so has Jet and Buddy, and he has 24/7 fresh accomodations so he doesnt feel as bad about being stuck in my room. 

     Yet, regardless of this, I can still tell he's depressed and anxious and longs to go outside. I live in a mountainous region where we will likely get snow consistently soon from the winter storms. I was planning on constructing a catio for him and still think that's a good plan, but I want knowledge of every option at my disposal as to, hopefully, help Rocky be happier. I don't think I can leash train him in my room as of the extremely small size but I'm not sure so that's why I'm asking these questions on here. 

     His depression, in turn, makes mine worse in all aspects, as whilst he isn't a registered support animal, he basically is for me and him being in any discomfort or sadness or anything of that sort heightens my problems, whilst also not knowing what to do about it or how to fix it and I need this to stop for both him and me so we both can have a healthy future.

I stayed buying her bottled mineral water and she seems to drink from her bowl a bit more now but not that often, the water level doesn't go down much.

Her diet consists of 1 and a half 100g pouches of wet food a day with some dry food to graze on. She's a very small cat and doesn't eat much but I'm considering upping her pouches to 2 a day with less dry food. Would 1.5 to 2 pouches provide enough hydration that she doesn't need to drink much or is this a problem?

My main questions right now are, is she likely getting enough water with the wet food already or:

1) Should I try adding water to her wet food?

2) Should I add more wet food if she seems to be a healthy weight? She's filled out a little bit but seems to be a good size for her age, I'm worried about her getting chubby

3) Should I keep trying with the fountain or is there no point if she prefers the bowl?

So, we have two in-house cats, Beef(female &amp; neutered) and Kathrine(female &amp; unknown)- but Beef originally came to us as practically feral and very young. We got her fixed, medicated, etc.

Another cat(Spicy Chicken) who looks like Beef in coloring and age and we're pretty sure that they're from the same litter- has finally warmed up to us and has given birth in our indoor porch area. We likely won't be able to keep Spicy Chicken as she's our neighbor's cat (though I say screw them for neglecting her yet still claiming ownership of her) but in the meantime we want the kittens to stay with us since it's getting pretty cold out. And this is actually the second time Spicy Chicken has been pregnant but we're pretty sure that none of the kittens from that litter made it as we saw no signs of them. The worry I have is Kathrine, she's lovely and sweet but not great with other cats and has shown some aggression toward Spicy Chicken in the past. I'm worried that she might not be cool with the kittens but it'll be inevitable that they'll meet.

I trapped their mother as well and had her fixed and released her (she was feral). Kittens were about 6 weeks old at the time and feral and oh so spicy! I have 2 cats of my own, so I have been taking care of 7 cats for about 4 months now. I’m 7.5 months pregnant and due in January, so I know I will need to give them up at some point. 
I have been rehabilitating them since July and getting them used to people. These kittens were so skittish and shy and still even after 4 months, really need work. I have come to realize that they need more help than I can provide. I have been working with an amazing organization and regularly attending adoption events to try and get them adopted- I have been consistently giving up my weekends to volunteer at these events. 2/5 have been adopted and returned. So the organization offered to let me move them to the adoption center and have a variety of people come in 2x per day to take care of them in order to socialize them. 
These kittens and I have been through a lot together - so Im really attached to them- all of them not just one in particular. I love them all in different ways. I rescued them, rehabilitated them, been through 2 rounds of ringworm with them, loved them, cared for them, fed them, etc for the last 4 months. So, I would like to keep one of them. There are 2 in particular that I have narrowed it down to. One of them a male tabby that you would never know was ever feral. My kids love him and he is great with them. The other a female gray tabby that loves our family but nobody else, really. 
Which one should I keep? 
With the female, I worry about behavior issues when I leave town or have strangers in the home. But I also worry that the female has only ever bonded with me and will never give anyone else a chance. 
I don’t worry about the male, he will be ok wherever he goes - here or adopted out. 
Do I take the female who I know is bonded with us and will likely have a harder time being adopted out? Or take the easier male that everyone in our home loves? 
Im super hormonal and have been crying over the thought of giving them up, but ultimately, I know that I have taken them as far as I can on my own in their socialization journey. I know giving them up is best. I want to keep one but I’m not sure which one. Please help me decide by Sunday!

My roommates and I are planning to adopt 2 kittens next year to take care of in our apartment. Two of my three (four including myself) roommates have experience with kittens, so taking care of them shouldn't be a problem. My concern lies back home. My family dog is an anxiety riddled five year old miniature Australian Shepherd. He has always had issues with other animals and people, often barking and growling at any sudden movements, but adjusts relatively quickly. He's never had issues with attacking other animals except for the occasional nip at other dogs at the park when they get too close to me (he's a big barker and chaser as he's a herding dog). Despite this knowledge, I'm unsure how he'd react to a cat, especially kittens. He's never been around one before, the only non-dog interaction was a bunny that he didn't care much about. Ideally I wouldn't take the risk of introducing him to kittens, especially since I intend to get them from a local rescue, but I am obligated to get them registered as Emotional Support Animals. I have depression and have struggled a bit this year without my dog to keep me company. The apartment complex we will be staying in is one of the few locations that we will be allowed to stay in next year, and the only one that doesn't require a subway. They don't allow normal pets, but they do allow ESAs (Emotional Support Animals). I initially intended to get a dog, but my roommates and I agree that cats would likely be easier. Due to them having to be registered as my ESAs, and my roommates being unable to take them home, I have no choice but to taken them home over winter break, and any other long term break.

I've been considering the idea of bringing the kittens home 2 weeks before the semester start date to get them adjusted to my dog. I'm hoping that if they're introduced at a young age, even for a short period of time, that their inevitable reintroduction for winter break will be much less stressful. I'm sure that a longer introduction period would be better but I need to work most of the summer to make enough money to last me through the semester, and support the two new babies! I was wondering if two weeks would be enough, and how to ensure that my dog and kittens meeting goes as seamlessly as possible. I've read quite a bit about slow exposure, so I've been planning to do that. I'm mostly concerned that since he barks quite a lot that they could end up traumatized.

Another concern I have is how to avoid damage to the apartment furniture. Is there a way to keep cats from scratching, and potentially damaging the furniture? I wouldn't normally have an issue (my dog is very destructive) but the apartment comes pre-furnished. Any product recommendations, training, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!

I also want to know how much attention kittens likely will need!! They will be coming from a foster home so I'm not sure if that would make a difference. I will try and make as much time for them as possible, but life gets in the way and my dog is quite needy so there might be times where I have to leave them with a family member or alone for periods of time. I want to ensure that they get as much love as possible :)

I'm not planning to get them until late August, I don't even know what they look like (we do have a vision of two male cats: a black one named Noctis, and a brown one named Leon, but we aren't too picky). I just want to make sure I'm not making any mistakes and that I'm as prepared as possible!! Also! Any product recommendations like litters boxes, carrying cages, and towers would be lovely!!

It started last night. 

I have two cats: Rosie is 5 and my sensitive girl. She's very sweet, but skittish and scares kind of easily, but that's actually been getting better. Then there's Phinley: my sweet, funny boy. He turned 2 in July. He likes to play a little more rough than she does, but they seemed to have figured that out. She actually plays by herself when she's in the mood. He's the same way now. There's never been much strife between them that I could see, except for once when Rosie (I think) came back from a dental cleaning last year and he treated her like a complete stranger for several days. They hissed and growled at each other, and made that weird noise that cats make when they're freaked out; that lar-a-lar-a-lar noise. We also just got back home from 9 months in California. They were fine there, but Rosie wasn't happy. She just slept a lot in her little scratcher bunker. She's been a lot better since we've been home. Happier, more comfortable and content. My girl. 

So last night, I was sitting in bed while she was curled up in my lap asleep. Phinley was in his little cavern bed on the floor, maybe 5 feet from the bed. All of the sudden, Rosie jerked awake and flew up into the air like something scared the hell out of her. Or hurt her. She took off for the living room as soon as she hit the floor, with Phinley right behind her. When I walked out there, I found him half wedged under the chair, and heard growling and hissing, so she was under the chair as well. That's one of her safe spots. So he hears me and crawls back out. I figured she needed a minute (or several), so Phin and I chilled in the bedroom again to give her time. Then I went to check on her. She was in a different spot, and when she saw Phin, she hissed and growled and ran up the cat tree. He took off after her and made that weird warble sound. I hadn't heard that in a while. 

Basically, it's still like this. I kept him in the room with me until about 5am and kept the door closed. She cried all night and they kind of played with each other under the door. It's a weird apartment and the bottom of the door leaves a good sized gap between it and the floor. At 5am, I opened the door to feed them and take my meds. She busted through the opening door and jumped over him, then onto her other perch. He immediately followed her and stared up at her, making that warbling noise again. So I picked her up to get her out safely and when I started to walk out, I felt his claws kinda dig into my legs. Wtf. Like he was trying to get at her. 

Eventually I was able to call the vet and they said to let them figure it out, but to be aware so that I could douse them in water or throw a blanket on them if needed. Ok. I let them see each other. She was in her favorite spot in the back of the apartment. I switched their areas earlier and slept in the living room with him. She's better about being left alone. They've both eaten and done their litter box stuff by this time. Anyways, I open the door and he immediately makes a beeline towards her. She growling, ears down, in the defensive stance on top of the dresser where she loves to sleep. He made that warble noise and is aggressively rubbing all over the spot he's on, occasionally staring her down. Mostly flopping all over and rubbing. Idk if this is a territorial / hierarchy thing, but it was weird. At one point, he did jump up to her spot and they threw paws at each other, spat, hissed, growled. He backed off then; but even now, 7 hours later, he's still trying to approach her and she's clearly not having it. I just picked up two multicat feliway kits and dosed him with gabapentin per the vet instructions. I can't get her to take it and she's under the bed. But wtf?

I need help! 
Okay so I am a senior in college and I do in and out of depressive states a lot.. medication isn’t my favorite thing ever and my therapist and my doctor recommended I get an emotional support animal. I’ve already wanted a cat anyways, so I went ahead and looked for a cat! I knew I wanted an older cat because kittens are just too much. But I met a cat named Telly, a 1.5 year old half Persian half whatever neighborhood cat. I met him and his owner and then we set up an arrangement for me to adopt him! A week went by and I picked him up and brought him to my place (I live in a dorm but it’s a studio apartment dorm… kinda big). He was obviously scared at first but within one day he was out and about and demanding pets. He’s picky, only eats turkey flavored food. So he didn’t eat at first because I mistakenly gotten chicken lol. Anyways, it’s been a week. He weaves in and out of my feet whenever I walk.. so I’m constantly tripping over him. If I don’t play with him for like 2 hours.. he isn’t tired and keeps me up all night meowing. And not just meowing, howling. And he stops if I pet him. Whenever I walk to the kitchen he runs after me and gets in my way when I’m trying to get his food, or make my own food… he just wants to be pet! I can’t sit at my desk because he repeatedly jumps onto my lap. If he’s not being pet, he stares at me. Like STARES AT ME. I like to take bubble baths, they are very relaxing. I can’t do that anymore because when I do he scratches at the door, and if I let him in he just stares at me and meows very loudly. Basically howling. I’m trying to ignore it, because if I get mad he doesn’t care because he likes any attention. He literally purrs if I get raise my voice. So yeah I’m trying to ignore him but it’s so hard.

It worked out really well until our financial situation got worse because I'm not getting jobs here (racism is prevalant) and my partner's company is not paying us enough or covering some expenses they said they would.


Cherry on top, I caught my partner sexting someone and my life fell apart. I ran back to my country, set up my cats to be more independent (trained them with feeders and whatnot) and ensured that they were well taken care of by my partner. He did a wonderful job with them and they're more happy and healthy brats. I came back to figure out the next steps for us and my future in general. Also, came back because I have no money left. But I'm not coping well here. I wasn't coping well with the move to begin with but now I'm very suicidal and I'm battling severw depression.

I cannot imagine a life without my cats but we are planning to pack up and head back because this whole experience has only depleted our resources and ruined our lives. I come from India and for some reason they have this funny rule about pet transportation.  It states that I have to be in a country for at least two years to be able to take my pets back with me. I don't think I have the mental stamina to do this. Plus, it costs a LOT to take them back. 

Is there a workaround or any suggestions for agencies who can help us? Also, people around me, including my therapist, are suggesting that we give them away because we have so much to deal with already.

Me and my partner adopted a cat from the shelter about a month ago. She was found on the streets back in August and came to the shelter with a broken leg (which is now healed) and seems to have been a house cat but noone came to claim her. She's two years old and looks to be a British Shorthair (she's not a fan of being picked up for long) and she seems to be used to us and comfortable with us.
Now she's quite active (I do try to play with her daily) and she loves birdwatching from the window, so I think she'd love the outside. We have a harness that she seems mostly okay with, we've put it on her  many times to get her accustomed to it. I know you're supposed to go slow and step by step. We live in a small apartment building, on the first floor and it has a tall fenced in yard, which is where I'd like to take her, going outside would mean going through the hall and down one set of stairs.
So far we've tried to go outside twice, once she wriggled out of the harness while we were putting on shoes by the door. I've adjusted the harness since then. The second time we got her to the door and to go a step into the hall by using a laser pointer and treats but she retreated back into the apartment.
So far Ive been thinking to get her used to going into the hall and exploring there and then moving outside when she gets more comfortable, but maybe I should put her in her carrier and go outside and let her come out and explore then (on a leash ofc)? Just because going into the hall first might take very long and she doesn't know that after that she'll get to go outside. Any advice how to go about it or tips from your experience?
I'm just very anxious to get her outside because I think she'd really enjoy it and it'd be good for her, since our apartment is quite small.",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,117933,public,self,Harness training/walking outside an adult cat,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/yyk39p/harness_trainingwalking_outside_an_adult_cat/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

A little bit of backstory:
My grandmother found her just a few months old outside and took her in. Since she could not keep her at that time, I took her in. At around 8-9 months, she started peeing on my bed and sofa and I figured that it’s due to hormones and got her spayed. The peeing stopped!
Fast forward, this summer I brought her to my grandmother’s place, since she was living in the countryside and I thought that she would like to run around outside instead of always being in my flat. She spent there 2 months and then my grandmother had to move, so I took her back. I was temporarily staying at my boyfriends place, which was a very small studio. She started to constantly pee everywhere. I thought maybe it was due to a medical issue and took her to the vet, but that was not it. Then I realised that maybe she just does not like the new space since it was so small. So I asked my grandmother to look after her for a bit until I get my place back. By that time, my grandmother had already moved to another place and is living in a flat, so my cat did not spend any time outside when she was with her. She did not pee once, until after a month, when my mom came for the weekend and she peed on my mom’s bed. My mom then brought her back to me since I moved back to my place. And ever since then (about a month) she’s peeing either on my sofa or my bed. She has 3 litter boxes, I clean them everyday. The are all located in private areas, easily accesible though. I thought, maybe she is jealous of my boyfriend (although they always play together, he feeds her sometimes and seem to be vibing well), so asked him to stay at his place for a week and see if that might be the issue. For a few days it was fine, but then the peeing started again. I read that someone had the same issue, so started feeding the cat on the sofa, since cat’s don’t do their business where they eat, however, today while I was on the sofa, she peed on me. The thing is, she is so playful and friendly and does not look anxious or stressing, but of course, I can’t know for sure how she’s feeling.

He was always very **very** needy, mewoing **a lot** (like - a lot) and asking for attention - which I can't really understand, because we really give him a lot of attention, play with him a lot, and has lots of toys he plays with. 

For the last couple months, he just decided that he would eat everything at sight. All our food (one time he peeled a boiled egg to reach the yolk) isn't safe, and we can't be distracted for 30 seconds, that he'll be having a go at it. He is also incredibly stubborn - we push him away from the food, take him off the table, and he'll repeat it over and over again, instantly, like nothing ever happened. If we leave him alone for a few hours, he'll even try to raid the garbage can! Even as I writing this, he was trying to go for my cereals. Yesterday, we were distracted for 5 minutes, and then noticed we was eating a pepperoni pizza - of course, later on, he would be puking. 

I really don't know what else to do. It can be extremely tiring, and it demands constant attention.

The vet figured he was just around a year old and we got all his shots and neutering out of the way.

My cat is 6 years old and isn’t the most cuddly, but can be when it’s on her terms. She is always waking me up to let me know it’s time for breakfast, and she’s always sitting in the kitchen sink for flowing water (despite her clean, fresh bowl of water - typical kitty). She is only chatty when she wants water or food, and occasionally tells me about her day when she comes to snuggle before bed. 

Today and yesterday she hasn’t been herself. She has been hiding under a chair in the office. She isn’t waking me up for breakfast, but still runs over when she hears me fill it but she barely touches it. She has not been in the sink. She has been walking around my apartment non-stop and has been meowing more than I’ve ever heard her. Also, her ears are very hot (which in itself isn’t super concerning but mixed with the other behaviours it raised some concern). Her tummy and armpits are not noticeably warmer than usual. 

My apartment building has been testing the fire alarms for the last three days, and I am hoping that this has just stressed her out. 

She has food, water, toys, lots of comfy places to snooze. Should I be concerned?

Our 8 month old has always had a naughty streak. We put everything away where he can't reach because he will break his way into anything and will try eat anything that fits in his mouth..including tissues. Today I had to take some out to blow my nose and as soon as I put it down on the table he jumped up and stole it! Then made a run for it. Once he gets tissues or his favourite ball in his mouth he tends to growl and not let go. For tissues we usually just waft a scent he hates around his nose so he drops it. This time he just withstood it and would not let go. He even had his claws out and almost scratched me while I was waving the smell around his nose. And he hissed as well! He never hisses usually. I had to get the oven mitts out to get it out of his mouth because he can eat a whole sheet of tissue. Any advice on how to correct this behaviour? For context we do have another kitten who is younger by 3 months who is more timid and docile.

I asked the people working if she was old enough to be adopted alone, asked if I should be concerned about single kitten syndrome, and they assured me that it was totally fine as long as I played with her a lot.

Welllll fast forward a year later and I’ve got a fully grown best buddy with a LOT of attitude. At times, she’s very sweet and loves to cuddle and always welcomes me home with a “?” shaped tail and rubbing her head on my legs. She’s also very funny to play with if she has the right toys.

The problem is I can’t keep up with her. She either destroys her favorite toys (realistic looking bird/rat/bee/moth string toys) within days, or she get’s bored of solo play toys too quickly—even when I hide them for part of the day to try to retain novelty. I feel guilty for getting frustrated when I can’t keep her entertained, and she lashes out at me. Her biting has been getting a lot worse (doesn’t draw blood or anything, but these are definitely not love bites). She’s not interested in being diverted to a toy, so sometimes I resort to giving her a (gentle!) defensive bop and walking away, or blow on her face, neither of which feel super effective either but I don’t know what else to do when she’s hurting me. She also swats and sneak attacks at the guy I’ve been dating, and I can tell it’s really starting to bug him that she’s not warming up with time, even after giving her new toys and treats every time he comes over.

I recently started working a lot more and am now gone at least 6 hours a day, occasionally overnight, and rarely for a couple of days at a time. I got her a cat tree as an attempt to “enrich her environment” but cannot afford to buy her new toys every single week. Any ideas how I can keep her happy affordably and sustainably? I live alone in a small studio apartment, and at this point she’s not well socialized so I don’t think adopting a buddy for her is a viable option.",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,117860,public,self,Help managing single kitten syndrome in my young adult cat?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/yy4206/help_managing_single_kitten_syndrome_in_my_young/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

I have loved cats ever since I was a child and never got a chance to own one. Now as an adult, I have that opportunity. 

The only thing that keeps me away from getting a cat is the idea of owning an animal and not giving it a family. I want to raise a cat, give it a mate, let them have their litter and be together. Thinking of neutering an animal or having to separate a mother from its litter leaves me feeling troubled.

I know this is unrealistic and a lot of space and money is required for this dream. But the idea of keeping an animal to myself and cutting of that future which I feel is a natural part of life keeps me away from getting one. Having a pet and just it being there for my own comfort and pleasure doesn't sit right with me.

I want to know if this is an overreaction. Am I thinking too deeply? Do cats maybe not feel this sense of connection?

My family and I adopted her from a local shelter as a Christmas present for me in 2016, and we really don't know anything about her past. She was kind of getting bullied by this fat tabby, which is one of the reasons I chose to adopt her. She can be a bit temperamental, but she's an amazing addition to our family.

Now, getting into my question. I've been wanting to get another cat for a while, as I'm a cat person, and since the passing of my dog a few years ago I've missed having several pets in the house. My cat, however, I don't think would be very thrilled at the idea. She's had some issues with both cats and dogs in the past- she'll hiss at neighborhood cats she can see from the window, and if my sister or family friends ever bring their dog over she'll smack and hiss at them. The dog I had mentioned before was a teenage chocolate lab that we had before we brought Zuzu home. Although she was wary and a bit aggressive at first, she did warm up to him a lot, and they became good friends (never any aggressive behavior, cuddling together, etc). He was a big pushover, and never barked, snapped, or even paid any attention to her when she would hiss at or smack him. This probably played a role in how well she liked him, as any dog with especially high energy or interest in her she absolutely despised. I should also mention that about a year ago, she had gotten a stressed induced UTI after we babysat a friend's dog for two weeks, and we have since refused to have any dog over for more than a few hours.

So what I'm getting at is, would it be a bad idea to see if she would open up to another animal in the house? I know she has the capacity to be chill with other animals, as she was with my lab, but I also worry about causing her any sort of significant stress and getting another UTI. I thought maybe if the cat had a very chill temperament like my past dog that it would be easier, but I just don't know. My desire for another cat aside, I also ask because my mom's boyfriend may be moving in with us soon, and he would likely bring his 14-year-old dog. The two have had a few interactions, and my cat wasn't as aggressive or defensive as she has been with other dogs, but I'm still concerned about it.

Long story short I decided to keep her as I’ve grown to love her and couldn’t imagine sending her to a shelter when she could have a loving home with me. 

Now the issues is I’ve had some health issues come up and will have to move move from Canada to Jordan for at least the next 4 months. I want to take the cat with me. It’s a really long flight - about 15-18 hours. Is it okay to put the cat through that? She is used to us being alone at home but when I go back to Jordan there will be more people at home and I am worried about how she will adapt to the new setting. Also, the house is much bigger than my current apartment. 

I just can’t imagine leaving her whole i go away for several months. No one i know can take her in. And my only option is to send her to a shelter which I will absolutely not do.

Well we could not find the canned food anywhere due to the pandemic shortage so we switched her to the kibble version as that was the only food she tolerated. After putting her on rinadazole, we were able to wean off the prescription food. Since then, wet food has been very rocky and she is extremely picky. One day she will eat it, another day she absolutely refuses to touch it. We eventually caved and got her Tiki carnivore kibble which she absolutely loves, however, it made her litter box smell horrendous the minute she goes in it. We ended up eventually switching to fresh pet Vital cat food and she loved it at first for about a year and the litter box issue disappeared. Now she’s refusing to eat it and will only eat the kibble. We tried introducing wet food again and she wasn’t into it. She’s a very happy cat and loves her freeze dried chicken treats and will eat the kibble so it’s not like she’s refusing to eat all together.

My 15 yo cat is recovering from a nasty URI that I suspect she got from one of the cats that frequents our yard. She was my landlord's cat that they left at the house when they moved to be cared for by tenants (weird I know). She needed some expensive medical care for her URI that I ended up paying for, resulting in my landlords handing over ownership.

The issue is that she is indoor/outdoor and has been for her entire life. I would personally prefer to have my cats remain indoors, and if she was indoor only she likely would not have contracted a URI. She doesn't stray from the yard so my concern is the cats that come in from other houses. She has started begging to go back out and I just feel so bad, because I know she loves to bask in the sun and watch the neighborhood through the fence. I do play with her when she's around and would be willing to do that more to keep her entertained indoors...

The other issue is I have 3 roommates and I anticipate her getting out again just by their lack of observation or care. One of them often has a dog visitor that goes in and out so I would need to ask that the sliding door remains closed at all times. I'm considering just blocking any entry/exit points in the yard that I can find to prevent other cats coming around, but I would be risking another expensive health scare.

Thoughts? Is it cruel to make her stay indoors when she's had outdoor freedom for 15 years? Has anyone experienced something similar?

She has had other bouts of constipation in the past so for the past few months she has been almost completely on a wet food diet (with the exception of a small amount of dry food she gets from an automatic feeder while I'm at work). This has helped greatly so I was surprised when she suddenly wasn't feeling well. Her appetite suddenly plummeted and she was hiding when I got home from work last night which was extremely out of character so I took her in just in case.\n\nAfter the initial evaluation it was determined that it was just some mild constipation and she received some fluids just in case as well as a prescription for lactulose. Temari has been on liquid prednisolone for a few months now, initially on a higher dose (0.7 ml per day) and now she is on a slightly lower dose (0.4 ml every other day). I have been administering it just fine for months now and Tem seems to do pretty well when it comes to getting her meds. I've almost got a technique down and it feels like she barely even notices when I give it to her. \n\nThat is until last night when I gave Temari the lactulose. I administered it the same as I usually would but she quickly turned her head and I'm afraid she might've inhaled some. Almost immediately after administering it, she coughed up some fluid on my arm and ran under my bed and started coughing pretty loudly. She coughed for a few minutes and gagged and I was pretty panicked. At the time my regular vet was closed and I called an emergency vet and they said just to monitor her. After a few minutes of coughing she stopped and hid for a bit longer before coming out. She since then has been eating and acting the same, but she has been sneezing a little this morning. \n\nI called my vet this morning too and they basically said the same thing (in terms of monitoring) but I can't help but be a little nervous. I'm already a bit of a worry wart and seeing posts/articles about aspiration has made me a little spooked.

He's really really good with cats and has had cats before, but this is my first run having a cat.  

The cat is a wonderful cat.  She's a little over a year old and very friendly, although she is pretty timid and still adjusting to her new home.

At first, I was really excited!  But over the past week or so, I've been feeling this overwhelming guilt that I am just not doing enough for her and I can't shake it.  It's making me regret adopting a cat and its making it really hard for me to bond with her.

I did read that new cat/dog parents can go through "" kitten blues"" or ""puppy blues"", but I don't really know if thats whats going on or if I am just not cut out to be a cat dad.

Thankfully, my boyfriend isnt going through this and has been beyond helpful in taking care of the cat and playing with her so she's not neglected.

I really have no intentions of surrendering the cat because of my feelings, especially seeing how happy she makes my boyfriend.

I guess I'm just wondering if these feelings will pass?  I hate thinking that I'm wasting time feeling guilty when I could be trying to bond with her...

I’ve read so many posts on what to do in this situation. “Ignoring the behavior” doesn’t help, as he just continues to do it in different spots to get my attention. I’ve tried redirecting him to where he can scratch, giving him treats when he scratches his post or mat. It is to the point where it is driving me insane.

A bit of background on our cat: she is a two year old rescue cat who was found hiding inside an industrial ac unit with her four kittens. She has been with us for about 8-9 months. She is normally a super sweet and affectionate gal but is not a fan of being picked up but loves a cuddle on her terms.

Anyways back to the current situation: 

Our lil gal escaped from the house recently after our door to our backyard wasn’t closed properly (we moved into a new place 4 weeks ago and we’re still getting used to the funky latches - totally my fault 😭) she proceeded to spend the day harassing and beating up every other cat on our street. There’s one really sweet kitty who has been coming into our yard and peeking through the glass door checking our cat out. And our cat totally beat this poor thing up under the floor boards of our house making some awful sounds but we couldn’t get to her to break up the fight.

She proceeded to keep running away from us and harassing other cats on our street until we finally were able to catch her and bring her home. She didn’t have a single scratch on her either which was very lucky- I hope the other cats are okay too. As she is normally the sweetest thing I felt like one of those parents getting brought into the school and being told that our sweet precious child is actually the BULLY. 

It’s been a couple of days and she has been pretty shitty with us. She still wants to be near us and be given affection but she is also much quicker to get angry and will bite and hiss which she would normally never do. Maybe I’m projecting but she just looks furious at us all the time. 

Is she just pissy that she had a taste of freedom and we took it from her furry little grasp? Is she just going through a comedown from being so overstimulated? Or is she feeling the guilt of bullying every other sweet cat on our street and just taking it out on us?

It’s pretty early days since her grand adventure terrorising our neighbourhood so she probably just needs some time to chill out. But just curious if anyone knows why exactly she’s become so moody or if there’s anything I should be doing to make her feel relaxed and comfy again?

He was born and raised in a shelter and I am his first owner.i got him when he was already 4 so he's probably 7 now. 

I tried every trick to get him comfortable with people. The first few months he was under the bed all the time. I'd feed him and keep him in my bed room and would play with him and give him treats.  And besides being too skiddish to let me leave the bed he would be calm around me so I started letting him go out at night. 

He still wouldn't come out under the bed unless I was laying in it. That never changed. Over a year passed and covid hit so I moved my bedroom and made that room my office. I kept a bed and cat tree in there for him and let him get familiar with the room like before. Still working on giving him space and privacy. He was fine there but hid under the cat tree whenever I was in the room. Again if I was seated he would come out but only if I stayed seated. 

After a while in that room I kept the door ajar with a door jam so he could slip in and out as he wanted. But he eventually snuck back under my bed and now won't leave my bedroom. So I tried to accommodate him again. But since then he's been less social and even avoids being social with me. Won't come to me to pet him and hides if I call his name. 

I've tried just leaving him alone but it's been over a year now and nothing has changed. What can I do to get my cat back? Is he just never going to like people? It really breaks my heart that he acts like I'm a threat when all I do is talk in soft voices and offer treats. He will NOT let you pick him up and acts like his life is in danger if you do but he's never hissed when trying to pick him up (you have to corner him fyi) like when I take him to the vet but he does cry and yowl like you're killing him lol.

A bit of background on our cat: she is a two year old rescue cat who was found hiding inside an industrial ac unit with her four kittens. She has been with us for about 8-9 months. She is normally a super sweet and affectionate gal but is not a fan of being picked up but loves a cuddle on her terms.

Anyways back to the current situation: 

Our lil gal escaped from the house recently after our door to our backyard wasn’t closed properly (we moved into a new place 4 weeks ago and we’re still getting used to the funky latches - totally my fault 😭) she proceeded to spend the day harassing and beating up every other cat on our street. There’s one really sweet kitty who has been coming into our yard and peeking through the glass door checking our cat out. And our cat totally beat this poor thing up under the floor boards of our house making some awful sounds but we couldn’t get to her to break up the fight.

She proceeded to keep running away from us and harassing other cats on our street until we finally were able to catch her and bring her home. She didn’t have a single scratch on her either which was very lucky- I hope the other cats are okay too. As she is normally the sweetest thing I felt like one of those parents getting brought into the school and being told that our sweet precious child is actually the BULLY. 

It’s been a couple of days and she has been pretty shitty with us. She still wants to be near us and be given affection but she is also much quicker to get angry and will bite and hiss which she would normally never do. Maybe I’m projecting but she just looks furious at us all the time. 

Is she just pissy that she had a taste of freedom and we took it from her furry little grasp? Is she just going through a comedown from being so overstimulated? Or is she feeling the guilt of bullying every other sweet cat on our street and just taking it out on us?

It’s pretty early days since her grand adventure terrorising our neighbourhood so she probably just needs some time to chill out. But just curious if anyone knows why exactly she’s become so moody or if there’s anything I should be doing to make her feel relaxed and comfy again?

The problem is he hasn’t peed in the litter box in two days. The Vet needs a urine sample so we put him in my sisters room with food and water so we could try to get it.

Instead he slept all day and didn’t use it, so we moved him into the bathroom with a cat bed to see if that would help. He pooped in the litter box but still hasn’t peed. If he doesn’t use it by tomorrow, we’re going to take him to the local vet hospital.

We could tell early on she was chatty, chirping and trilling when she played with toys. But over the last few months, vocalization has increased excessively—especially at night.

She’ll spend a portion of the night playing independently (lots of chatter there) and looking out the window. But from 3-7am, she’ll start of cycle of going through all the rooms and bedrooms with her toys, trying to get humans to play with her. We used to keep the bedroom doors open, but she’d wake us up bringing her toys into the bed and walking on us. She won’t lay or rest in bed, she just seems to want to play. Now, we keep the bedroom doors closed, but she’ll cry in the doorway until we let her in. No amount of play time before my bedtime (around 10p) pacifies her til morning. All other behaviors are normal, she doesn’t act up, she doesn’t seem unhappy. She just seems… bored.

(This was my mistake I poured the new litter out first and then forgot I needed to mix my old litter and needed to go buy more, so it’s just two litter boxes for now).

My plan WAS to clean her litter box on this weekend and do it 50-50 but I just need a reality check. 

I had JUST cleaned her litter boxes maybe 15 min before and saw her sniffing around her the box with only the new litter. But she seemed to be tasting it!? I stopped her twice before she left it alone. She did the cat chewing jaw so I think she tasted it, but I couldn’t see from my angle. 

Her old litter is Arm&amp;Hammer Scoop and I am switching to Worlds Best. 

I know Worlds best is corn based but obviously I don’t want her to eat it, and i know eating litter can be a sign of stress or health problems. 

I am now all sorts of worried I am stressing my cat out because I am giving her new wet food (dry food is same) and realize I may have made too many changes and she’s stressed and I feel like such an awful pet parent!

Me and my boyfriend we have a 2year old cat that was found on the street but he was already quite used to humans. 
Yesterday a friend of ours called us to say he had a cat living inside his walls for the last 2 weeks and he finally manage to get him out. It's a baby cat no more than 2 months old. 
I couldn't in good consicous leave the kitten outside in the street with the cold temperatures, wind and rain that we've been having. So we took the stray cat in tonight. 
He's terrified and dehydrated. I'm taking him/her to the vet tomorrow to do a full check up. 

Now my question, how do I get a stray kitten used to humans and to another cat? How do j get my other cat used to the kitten? I wanna do this properly to have a chance of keeping the kitten (if last case scenario they really sont get along I already have a friend that will take the kitten in). 

I've currently closed the kitten in a division with water, food, bed, litter, and I'm giving him space but my older cat is curious and goes to put his paw under the door to check on the kitten.

-The growling and helicopter ears from mom only seems to happen when she is in my room with me, and the son enters
-she’s more defensive than aggressive, like she’s afraid of him but I have no idea why since in two years I’ve never seen him attack/bother her, he just seems confused by her reaction
-I give both of them catnip, I know it makes them behave strangely but not sure if aggression is a side affect

Both neutered and indoor only. They've got some ragdoll blood in them, if that info is important.

The female is 3kg and male is 3.5, weighed this morning before breakfast.

The female kitten has shown me she can self regulate, very occasionally leave a bit of food. The male one will clean his bowl to the point it looks washed and then go on to clean hers. Also meows for food when he sees me getting their bowl. 

I'm currently feeding them 300 calories give or take. 3 main meals of wet food, 1-2 snacks of wet food pouches shared between them, and dry food as treats before bed (5-6 varying meals a day). When they split food I gave the male one a bit more. 

I have conflicting info... The pouches say ~3-3.5 pouches for their age, which is ~240-280 kcals. But other websites (untamed list of kcal for kitten weight, not age) say ~400 kcal for 3.5kg. 

So I've got one source saying less than 300kcal for their AGE, another saying 400 for their WEIGHT...

I unfortunately don't trust my vet on this. I was feeding them 3 pouches a day with dry food when they were 6 months old and vet said my male kitten is on the heavier end of healthy. I trusted him and reduced dry food but he meowed more and was lethargic. So I did more research and based on the ""what does his waist look like"" diagram he's either underweight or lower end of health (could feel his ribs and spine easily, his shoulder blade was very obvious). So I feel I did him injustice and slowly went up to 300 kcal. But I'm not sure where to go from here... Do I stay 300 or go up to 350 gradually to 400?

He doesn't seem to like the long hallway that connects to the room. I've tried putting another tree and a tunnel he loves in the hallway to give him some places to hide and make it smell familiar. Nothing seems to work. We've lived here since the 8th of October.

I would like some advise on how to introduce them. I know to start off with keeping them in separate rooms so they can get each others scent before actually meeting. But after that, I am not sure how to safely have them in the same room. 

For some background on my dog: she gets along with other dogs, she had been to pet hotels and is always fine being in the room with the dogs, but I am not sure how she is with cats. I know she can be territorial because we have seen her get aggressive toward humans (like my dog is very protective of me. If I am laying with my dog and my mom comes toward us, the dog will growl at my mom) So I am not sure if she will bring this side of her out on the cat, and if so, how do I prevent it?

And some background on the cat: she had been around other cats, and loves them. She is young and very playful, but she has never been around a dog before. My cat has never shown any signs of aggression. 

The house that we will be in is quite small, it has two bedrooms with an open kitchen/living room area. There is also a screened in porch. (I mention this because I am wondering if it would be a good idea to have one pet outside and one pet inside so they can see each other without being able to harm each other. But again, my dog is territorial, so I am not sure if that would make it even worse) Also, I think my cat might be a little bigger than my dog (my dog is a small white dog and my cat is a big black cat)

I need different perspectives in order for me to make the best decision here and I\'m really struggling. Your time and energy would be really, really appreciated. If you choose to help, thank you. I want to make the best decision for everyone, but most of all, the cat I\'ve been watching. TL;DR at the bottom.   \n\n\nWhen I moved into my current living situation, I met all my neighbors and they all seemed very chill and friendly. One woman, Neighbor A, seemed a little eccentric but not particularly weird or anything, though she did have those ""faraway eyes"", a kind of vacant appearance in them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA month in or so, I began hearing blood curdling screams. It sounded as if a woman was being murdered. I\'d go out and look, but I never saw anything or anyone. The sound was bouncing around some of the building walls and it was difficult to tell exactly where it was coming from. This went on, happening every few nights, and eventually after going out to investigate, a different neighbor informed me that it was actually Neighbor A, and that she had been telling everyone outlandish and strange things; things involving portals, politicians spying on her and attacking her or breaking into her place, that she was being sexually assaulted by demons, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately, things began to escalate between Neighbor A and the man across from her, Neighbor B, and the police were involved. Neighbor A was I guess leaving stuff on people\'s doorsteps, including a knife wrapped in a shirt. At one point, she was threatening violence and said she would kill them. She destroyed personal property and tried to get into their unit. I heard her roaming the street outside shouting out racial obscenities. Neighbor B said that Neighbor A told her a celebrity\'s brother scratched and stabbed her, and showed him visible wounds on her leg, which he presumed to be the result of self-harm. No one was visiting her. The police came several times, bringing a social worker with them who likely tracked down and contacted her family. Eventually her brother got her to check in to a hospital, somewhat unwillingly. This was about two months ago when she checked in, and her stuff was moved out shortly thereafter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\'ve learned since that Neighbor A, who is almost 60, has been dealing with mental illness since their mid-20s. She was formerly a ward of the state, and I guess she isn\'t anymore somehow, but she became one because she tried to run a man over with her car on two separate occasions and was likely found to be mentally incapable of managing her own life. This of course happened again when she was my neighbor, so there\'s an ongoing pattern of things getting bad, her ""recovering"" or reaching a point where her symptoms are contained, and things getting bad again. As far as I have been told, she refuses to medicate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis brings us to the cat. She is lovely and sweet and affectionate, but deeply traumatized. I have never met a cat so skittish and afraid and hypervigilant. But she has grown accustomed to me, and trusts me to a significant extent. She will come when I call, and she will hop into bed and cuddle when I ask her to. I admit I feel attached to this cat, and that that fuels my desire to protect her and give her the best outcome possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis cat formerly was under Neighbor A\'s care for five years. She\'s ten years old now. I don\'t know much of her history before then, but I know that while I lived near Neighbor A, that cat was enduring screaming, breaking windows, and possibly other things as well given Neighbor A\'s erratic behavior. When Neighbor A was hospitalized the cat was left behind, found trapped in a closet. Neighbor B was given the keys by management to check in on the cat, and he reported hearing the cat *screaming and crying.* Sounds that he said scared him and made him feel sick. The cat was released from the closet and hid in the house elsewhere, until she actually broke out of a cracked window pane (cracked by Neighbor A) and escaped the house. We found the window screen and a bunch of broken glass and the cat was gone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt didn\'t take long for her to start showing back up, given that she was an indoor cat for most of her life. Neighbor A told us the cat had FIV. Given that she had nowhere else to go, with no food and no shelter, it made sense because she didn\'t know where else to go and was pretty traumatized, unlikely to roam about and find new territory brazenly. She was outside for roughly a month, and narrowly avoided a bout of rain and chilly temperatures that would have been miserable to endure. I spent time outside with this cat, giving her food and brushing her and petting her. She would come up to me if I just sat still and presented myself as non-threatening. She clearly wanted to be taken care of, haha, but was unsure of human beings at this point, understandably so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI began leaving my door open, and letting the cat enter my dwelling. I\'d feed her, and show good will and again, seem as non-threatening as possible. Neighbor B, who has been incredibly supportive through all this, suggested we arrange a vet visit so that we could get the cat\'s chip scanned and test for FIV, with the intention of finding a permanent home for her, either with me or someone else. But we had to contain her and get her in a crate in order for this to be possible. The intention was to keep her inside my place, given her unknown status regarding FIV, we also didn\'t want her to get into a fight with any of the other neighbor cats.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe entered my home one night after a month of wandering, and I closed the door. She was visibly scared and upset at first, but I was able to calm her down pretty quickly. I held her and pet her and she began purring and her meows became softer and softer. It took time, but after a week or two she had become fairly acclimated to being with me and for all intents and purposes is calm and content. I have many, many pictures and videos of her on my phone being an absolute sweetheart. Making biscuits, purring, cuddling. She loves to be held close against my chest while I lay down. I\'ll read her stories or sing soft songs for her and she purrs. I always wake up with her on my bed, or by my face lol. She\'s being fed high quality food and is finally clean and warm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the vet appointment, I paid for a test that determined that she was actually FIV negative. She\'s 10 years old and in generally pretty great health, however she has missing teeth and dental issues that have likely been festering for a large part of when she was under Neighbor A\'s care. These dental issues are not cheap to resolve, but I\'m committed to resolving them through any means necessary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I can tell Neighbor A, for better and certainly for worse, loves this cat. She has been constantly asking about whether or not she\'s ok while in the hospital. This cat is essentially a child for her and this situation is making me sick to my stomach. Legally at this point, the cat does belong to her because she was the one who adopted her. I have no idea if she still has adoption papers and given her status it\'s likely she has lost them or doesn\'t know where they are, but that doesn\'t change the fact that this is technically her cat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNeighbor A is being released soon, and the brother told me if I couldn\'t or wouldn\'t pay for the fees all on my own, that I could give it back to him and he would likely give it back to his sister to ""appease her"", in the sense that he and his family have been appeasing her for the past 30 years, or ""mitigating harm"", by bankrolling her, buying her phones, cars, etc. They come from money, but they\'re expressing unwillingness to help pay for these dental procedures if I\'m the one who keeps her, because based on what he\'s told me, ""it\'s her cat and it would really help her.""\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have so many issues with this statement. For one, it wasn\'t enough to help her stay out of the hospital. This cat isn\'t going to solve anything long term. Medication, which is being refused, likely will. But this cat has proven, at least based on what I\'ve seen, to be a largely ineffective method for mitigating the symptoms and negative outcomes from them. Furthermore, this illness manifested at a young age and only got worse and worse. Her behavior and criminal record indicates this, and there is no sign of her actually getting better in the hospital. She is still saying things that don\'t align with our shared, collective/objective reality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo, this cat is not an emotional support stuffed animal. This cat is fucking traumatized. It is a living thing with feelings and emotions and memories and a desire to live a decent life. From my perspective, after spending a month with her and seeing how her behavior has changed within a safe home, she has endured hell. I keep thinking about how, were I cat, what it must be like to have this giant alien, this titan many times my size, acting erratically and screaming and breaking things around me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThree, this cat\'s health was being neglected. Her teeth are in bad shape and her breath is noticeably yucky, though it doesn\'t detract from how much I love her or how much I cuddle her, I can\'t imagine dental and gum infections are pleasant or make life, or eating, easier. It is unlikely that Neighbor A will or can fix these problems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNeighbor B and I wanted to relay to Neighbor A that we had seen the cat and fed her, but she stopped showing up and is now missing/gone. I hate lying, but it seemed a necessary evil in a situation where being honest will put myself or my neighbors in a fearful or potentially dangerous situation. Apparently the brother won\'t do this on the grounds of ""being honest"", though if I\'m being honest with myself, it\'s mostly just because he wants to rid himself of this issue, give the cat back, and go back to his life. He\'s been dealing with her illness for 30+ years so I can\'t say I don\'t sympathize or get it, but he doesn\'t really care about the cats outcome, at least not more than he cares about his own. He has his reasons, but those don\'t sway my conviction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, it seems he\'s unwilling to cooperate at this point, and now I don\'t know what to do. Neighbor A doesn\'t know I have her cat, but I can\'t ensure that he won\'t tell her. I don\'t want to involve myself in a dispute with a woman who has a criminal record involving attempted vehicular manslaughter, but I also don\'t want to give this cat back to her, more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don\'t want to just give the cat up and be like ""oh well that\'s it problem solved for me!"". Or rather, I can\'t. It feels wrong on so many levels. This cat can\'t advocate for itself. It can not choose for itself what it wants on this level. Is it not my responsibility now?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, I don\'t know how the law works surrounding pet ownership. I understand this is her cat, but it was also effectively a stray for over a month. Neighbor A would not have been able to be contacted, were this cat to show up in a shelter. It is chipped, but the chip is currently under my name. Chip companies do not arbitrate ownership or involve themselves, and I honestly and thoroughly explained the situation to them and they accepted the transfer, which I understand is also probably a part of how they make money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do I do? What do I have at my disposal? Are there any legal grounds for removing ownership of this cat from a neglectful owner, despite animals being considered ""property""? Am I basically just forced to give them back, otherwise opening myself up to having to go to court over this if she tries? If she returns with malicious or hostile intent Neighbor B will get a restraining order, but this doesn\'t ensure my safety if she discovers I have her cat and don\'t want to just toss it back into her frankly incompetent and unstable arms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR schizophrenic neighbor was screaming, threatened people and shows unstable/violent tendencies and is now hospitalized but going to be released soon. Her brother wants me to return the cat, and won\'t cooperate by lying to her and saying the cat just ran away. She doesn\'t know I have the cat, but she thinks it\'s in the neighborhood. I want to avoid giving her this cat for the sake of the cat\'s wellbeing, and I want her to stay away from us. I also have to contend with the legal reality of her being the rightful, albeit incapable owner, of this cat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTell it to me straight. I need honesty and objectivity here.  \n\n\nIf you\'re here and willing to help, bless you.

This of course happened again when she was my neighbor, so there&amp;#39;s an ongoing pattern of things getting bad, her &amp;quot;recovering&amp;quot; or reaching a point where her symptoms are contained, and things getting bad again. As far as I have been told, she refuses to medicate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the cat. She is lovely and sweet and affectionate, but deeply traumatized. I have never met a cat so skittish and afraid and hypervigilant. But she has grown accustomed to me, and trusts me to a significant extent. She will come when I call, and she will hop into bed and cuddle when I ask her to. I admit I feel attached to this cat, and that that fuels my desire to protect her and give her the best outcome possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This cat formerly was under Neighbor A&amp;#39;s care for five years. She&amp;#39;s ten years old now. I don&amp;#39;t know much of her history before then, but I know that while I lived near Neighbor A, that cat was enduring screaming, breaking windows, and possibly other things as well given Neighbor A&amp;#39;s erratic behavior. When Neighbor A was hospitalized the cat was left behind, found trapped in a closet. Neighbor B was given the keys by management to check in on the cat, and he reported hearing the cat &lt;em&gt;screaming and crying.&lt;/em&gt; Sounds that he said scared him and made him feel sick. The cat was released from the closet and hid in the house elsewhere, until she actually broke out of a cracked window pane (cracked by Neighbor A) and escaped the house. We found the window screen and a bunch of broken glass and the cat was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;#39;t take long for her to start showing back up, given that she was an indoor cat for most of her life. Neighbor A told us the cat had FIV. Given that she had nowhere else to go, with no food and no shelter, it made sense because she didn&amp;#39;t know where else to go and was pretty traumatized, unlikely to roam about and find new territory brazenly. She was outside for roughly a month, and narrowly avoided a bout of rain and chilly temperatures that would have been miserable to endure. I spent time outside with this cat, giving her food and brushing her and petting her. She would come up to me if I just sat still and presented myself as non-threatening. She clearly wanted to be taken care of, haha, but was unsure of human beings at this point, understandably so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I began leaving my door open, and letting the cat enter my dwelling. I&amp;#39;d feed her, and show good will and again, seem as non-threatening as possible. Neighbor B, who has been incredibly supportive through all this, suggested we arrange a vet visit so that we could get the cat&amp;#39;s chip scanned and test for FIV, with the intention of finding a permanent home for her, either with me or someone else. But we had to contain her and get her in a crate in order for this to be possible. The intention was to keep her inside my place, given her unknown status regarding FIV, we also didn&amp;#39;t want her to get into a fight with any of the other neighbor cats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She entered my home one night after a month of wandering, and I closed the door. She was visibly scared and upset at first, but I was able to calm her down pretty quickly. I held her and pet her and she began purring and her meows became softer and softer. It took time, but after a week or two she had become fairly acclimated to being with me and for all intents and purposes is calm and content. I have many, many pictures and videos of her on my phone being an absolute sweetheart. Making biscuits, purring, cuddling. She loves to be held close against my chest while I lay down. I&amp;#39;ll read her stories or sing soft songs for her and she purrs. I always wake up with her on my bed, or by my face lol. She&amp;#39;s being fed high quality food and is finally clean and warm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the vet appointment, I paid for a test that determined that she was actually FIV negative. She&amp;#39;s 10 years old and in generally pretty great health, however she has missing teeth and dental issues that have likely been festering for a large part of when she was under Neighbor A&amp;#39;s care. These dental issues are not cheap to resolve, but I&amp;#39;m committed to resolving them through any means necessary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I can tell Neighbor A, for better and certainly for worse, loves this cat. She has been constantly asking about whether or not she&amp;#39;s ok while in the hospital. This cat is essentially a child for her and this situation is making me sick to my stomach. Legally at this point, the cat does belong to her because she was the one who adopted her. I have no idea if she still has adoption papers and given her status it&amp;#39;s likely she has lost them or doesn&amp;#39;t know where they are, but that doesn&amp;#39;t change the fact that this is technically her cat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Neighbor A is being released soon, and the brother told me if I couldn&amp;#39;t or wouldn&amp;#39;t pay for the fees all on my own, that I could give it back to him and he would likely give it back to his sister to &amp;quot;appease her&amp;quot;, in the sense that he and his family have been appeasing her for the past 30 years, or &amp;quot;mitigating harm&amp;quot;, by bankrolling her, buying her phones, cars, etc. They come from money, but they&amp;#39;re expressing unwillingness to help pay for these dental procedures if I&amp;#39;m the one who keeps her, because based on what he&amp;#39;s told me, &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s her cat and it would really help her.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have so many issues with this statement. For one, it wasn&amp;#39;t enough to help her stay out of the hospital. This cat isn&amp;#39;t going to solve anything long term. Medication, which is being refused, likely will. But this cat has proven, at least based on what I&amp;#39;ve seen, to be a largely ineffective method for mitigating the symptoms and negative outcomes from them. Furthermore, this illness manifested at a young age and only got worse and worse. Her behavior and criminal record indicates this, and there is no sign of her actually getting better in the hospital. She is still saying things that don&amp;#39;t align with our shared, collective/objective reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two, this cat is not an emotional support stuffed animal. This cat is fucking traumatized. It is a living thing with feelings and emotions and memories and a desire to live a decent life. From my perspective, after spending a month with her and seeing how her behavior has changed within a safe home, she has endured hell. I keep thinking about how, were I cat, what it must be like to have this giant alien, this titan many times my size, acting erratically and screaming and breaking things around me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three, this cat&amp;#39;s health was being neglected. Her teeth are in bad shape and her breath is noticeably yucky, though it doesn&amp;#39;t detract from how much I love her or how much I cuddle her, I can&amp;#39;t imagine dental and gum infections are pleasant or make life, or eating, easier. It is unlikely that Neighbor A will or can fix these problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Neighbor B and I wanted to relay to Neighbor A that we had seen the cat and fed her, but she stopped showing up and is now missing/gone. I hate lying, but it seemed a necessary evil in a situation where being honest will put myself or my neighbors in a fearful or potentially dangerous situation. Apparently the brother won&amp;#39;t do this on the grounds of &amp;quot;being honest&amp;quot;, though if I&amp;#39;m being honest with myself, it&amp;#39;s mostly just because he wants to rid himself of this issue, give the cat back, and go back to his life. He&amp;#39;s been dealing with her illness for 30+ years so I can&amp;#39;t say I don&amp;#39;t sympathize or get it, but he doesn&amp;#39;t really care about the cats outcome, at least not more than he cares about his own. He has his reasons, but those don&amp;#39;t sway my conviction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, it seems he&amp;#39;s unwilling to cooperate at this point, and now I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. Neighbor A doesn&amp;#39;t know I have her cat, but I can&amp;#39;t ensure that he won&amp;#39;t tell her. I don&amp;#39;t want to involve myself in a dispute with a woman who has a criminal record involving attempted vehicular manslaughter, but I also don&amp;#39;t want to give this cat back to her, more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to just give the cat up and be like &amp;quot;oh well that&amp;#39;s it problem solved for me!&amp;quot;. Or rather, I can&amp;#39;t. It feels wrong on so many levels. This cat can&amp;#39;t advocate for itself. It can not choose for itself what it wants on this level. Is it not my responsibility now?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I don&amp;#39;t know how the law works surrounding pet ownership. I understand this is her cat, but it was also effectively a stray for over a month. Neighbor A would not have been able to be contacted, were this cat to show up in a shelter. It is chipped, but the chip is currently under my name. Chip companies do not arbitrate ownership or involve themselves, and I honestly and thoroughly explained the situation to them and they accepted the transfer, which I understand is also probably a part of how they make money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do I do? What do I have at my disposal? Are there any legal grounds for removing ownership of this cat from a neglectful owner, despite animals being considered &amp;quot;property&amp;quot;? Am I basically just forced to give them back, otherwise opening myself up to having to go to court over this if she tries? If she returns with malicious or hostile intent Neighbor B will get a restraining order, but this doesn&amp;#39;t ensure my safety if she discovers I have her cat and don&amp;#39;t want to just toss it back into her frankly incompetent and unstable arms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR schizophrenic neighbor was screaming, threatened people and shows unstable/violent tendencies and is now hospitalized but going to be released soon. Her brother wants me to return the cat, and won&amp;#39;t cooperate by lying to her and saying the cat just ran away. She doesn&amp;#39;t know I have the cat, but she thinks it&amp;#39;s in the neighborhood. I want to avoid giving her this cat for the sake of the cat&amp;#39;s wellbeing, and I want her to stay away from us. I also have to contend with the legal reality of her being the rightful, albeit incapable owner, of this cat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tell it to me straight. I need honesty and objectivity here.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re here and willing to help, bless you.

The doctor said that he would probably start eating again once he feels a bit better but for that i have to make him take his medicine somehow.
He isn't into treats at all and i cannot find a way to make him take his pills for the life of me.
If anyone has a good idea for something that can hide a pill well and would be easy to eat for a sick cat, that would be great.

My partner and I have two brothers, born in our home in May 2020. They’re super sweet and well behaved. One is super fluffy and the other, the runt of the litter, has a short sleek coat. 

The runt has some personality quirks, and his most recent is kind of strange. He likes to hold “hands”, for one! He had always been better with water than his brother, licking the inside of the tub, and just general curiosity with the bath. 

Now, every time I take a shower, he sits next to the shower and meows. It started where I would pet him and he seemed to like the water, he would lick my hands and purrs like crazy. So I tried a warm washcloth. This cat LOVES this, he lets me wipe down almost his whole body, purrs like it’s the best thing ever, and then waits until I am done and even lets me towel dry him.

I’m coming to the wonderful Reddit community today as I fear I’m going slightly insane and I could really do with some advice. Details below:

I grew up with cats, all of them with different personalities (as they tend to have) and I really missed having that fun feline companionship once I moved out almost 9 years ago. For years all I wanted was to have my own cat again and two months ago that dream finally became reality when my new landlord agreed that we (me and my partner of many years) could have one in our house. 

I immediately contacted our local shelter and told them that we would be more than happy to take on a more senior cat that might have been overlooked due to their age or looks before because none of that mattered very much to me, all I wanted was a little cuddle bug that would enjoy hanging out with me. Don’t get me wrong, cats are still cats and having grown up around them I am well aware that they don’t always want to be loved on and sometimes just wanna be left alone which, again, completely fine I just wanted a somewhat healthy, mostly affectionate little cat to call my own.

They were incredibly lovely and informed me that they had a great fit for us, an almost 10 year old little lady, that they told us whilst very shy at first, was also very affectionate. I was incredibly happy and a few days later we went to pick her up. Staff warned us that she wasn’t having a good day and was hiding in her igloo, but since we were warned that she was a timid cat ahead of time I didn’t let it bother me, I knew that she was just very scared. They told us that she came from a multi pet plus kids household where she hid for most of the day and would barely come out because she was very unsettled by all the goings on, hence why she was rehomed. We took her home that same day still.

She’s a very cute cat and after hiding for most of the day for the first few weeks she’s started to come out of her shell and will now sleep on the sofa or the bed instead of hiding somewhere in the house out of sight. She’s even super playful still and its very cute to watch.

Now my (would like to make it very clear that this is indeed a me problem, the cat is a cat and has obviously not done anything wrong) problem: 
She doesn’t like to be touched much or hang out with me. She will meow for attention in the mornings and evenings when she wants to be fed or wants someone to throw her toy around for her but won’t like it if you try and stroke her and evade. When trying to pet her when she’s sitting down she will gently swat at you or get up and leave so she clearly doesn’t enjoy it. She will also spend her time in a different room than me if she can and never really seeks company other than for meal times.

I’m really sad about it. The rational side of me knows that she’s just a cat and she doesn’t know any better but I just feel so heartbroken every time I look at her. I just want her to enjoy being with me, even if she never wants to be held or doted on loads I could live with that as long as she still at least enjoys being around me. But it doesn’t seem like she does, if anything she avoids me most of the time. I’ve tried being the one who feeds her, bonding over treats and playing. But she just doesn’t seem to have an much of an interest in interacting with me.

I feel like a horrible person because of how selfish I am being about this. I’ve been crying a lot because I feel like a terrible cat owner that can’t just accept that they have an independent cat and move on. My partner is getting frustrated with me being so upset about this as well and has told me that I need to stop being this emotional and that she’ll get around to liking me more eventually, but I feel like I’m getting nowhere. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? Has anyone experienced something similar before and if so how did you make yourself get over yourself? How do I stop being so sad about not having the cuddly loving pet I wanted?

Again I know im being ridiculous and acting like a sensitive child, I just don’t know how to stop so any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Note: I would never bring her back to the shelter regardless of my feelings. I made a commitment when I picked her that I would give her the best possible rest of her life I can and that commitment is unconditional.

I have two cats. One is nearly two years, one is 3 months. 

The two year old has always had a problem waking me up excessively early. Honestly it’s on &amp; off. Over the past few months though (even before we got the little one) it has been excruciatingly bad. 

I make sure to play with them both before bed. They also get a small treat before bed, and throughout the day they are played with (we literally walk them) by us and each other. They are also very well fed. 

However, right around 4-5 am (our wake up time is 7) the older one starts. Meowing loudly, scratching at my face to wake my up, walking on my body, jumping on and off the bed. Now she’s teaching the little one this habit as well. 

I thought she needed more play time so I play with her even later. Nope, doesn’t work. I had hoped having the little one around would keep her occupied/distracted, but not really. 

We live in a studio-style apartment so there’s not really “another room” I can put her in. 

I have tried feeding her dinner later and later but that doesn’t seem to have any effect. 

I have tried just waiting up for 2-3 hours or holding off on feeding them for as long as I can, but I’m exhausted. I have a hard job &amp; a long commute and I haven’t had one night of solid sleep in so long. 

I don’t feed them dry food &amp; I worry about the logistics of a wet automatic feeder.

He also pushes the bowl all over, spilling out the water all over our kitchen. I've never caught him doing this so I'm not sure why it's happening, but he does it 2-3 times a day.

My parents have asked me to come stay with them this Christmas but I am a little worried about bringing my kitten on the train. 

She will have only had her 1st set of vaccinations at this point (due her booster on December 28th). The journey is 3 hours long and usually is a quiet journey. 

Also my parents have a cat but he is old and blind and does not go outside of there house (don’t think he’s been in contact with another cat for 2-4 years) and is also fully vaccinated. Their house is also big enough to keep the kitten and my parents cat completely separated if need be. 

Do you think this will be safe for the kitten as most advice I find says that as long as the kitten isn’t in contact with another unvaccinated cat it would be fine. 

I’m happy to stay in my own home this Christmas however my grandma is becoming quite unwell so I want to make the journey if I can. 

I do have a good carry case for the kitten and will be travelling with a friend also. 

Any advice would be appreciated!

I absolutely fell in love with cats after that experience. Someone like me who gets drained of energy around people quickly, I would love to have a purry companion to go back to. I feel it like it would be great for my mental health too since I live alone.

TLDR: I know for a fact I will be a cat dad one day however my dilemma is whether I should get a cat now and perhaps later in life when I am much more stable and settled. 

My arguments AGAINST getting a cat now:
- I might be moving states or countries in the next year for better work opportunities, should I wait a few more years and settle down and then get a cat?
- I do not have my own car yet, I am worried that regular vet checkups might be a hassle without my own car, ofc I would not want to compromise on my cat’s health.

My arguments FOR getting a cat now:
- It would be awesome to have my own little goofball, I feel like it would be great for my mental health too, I often work remotely and it can get lonely at times.

Sorry for the long post but this is something that has been on my mind for a while now, I just wanted someone to reason with me on this and fellow cat mom/dads please feel free to drop advice on whether those challenges can be overlooked while adopting a cat.  
Please feel free to ask questions and share any similar experiences and what did you do?

jet was raised around different cats for a couple months, because i would always foster 1 additional kitten around his age. eventually, i stopped fostering for a bit and went back to it later (we were fostering liam and ended up adopting him).

initially, they didn’t like each other, but after slow introductions they have grown to be a bonded pair. they play together, groom one another, cuddle together, etc. 

liam is very affectionate. he follows me around, needs constant attention from me, won’t let me use the bathroom alone. yk, typical clingy cat stuff.

jet USED to be very affectionate, as a kitten. i know it’s typical for them to become less affectionate during adolescence and adulthood, but i think this is different. 

jet has grown to run away whenever he sees me step in his direction. his tail is always low- not between his legs, but low. it is either like “ / “ or it is slightly curled at the base of his tail, angled downward with a hook at the tip of his tail. he walks around the house with his tail in this position all the time. i would insert a picture but i rarely use reddit and don’t know how to do that lol. he isn’t scared to be in my vicinity, but he does not like me approaching him, even if i do so slowly. he sleeps on my bed occasionally, and lets me scratch his chin every once and a while. he rarely lays with his stomach exposed and loafs a LOT.

he generally doesn’t like being touched, but i am the one who typically has to chase him around cut his nails, give him eyedrops (he has issues with his left eye), and sometimes have to pull him out from under something to do so. and i obviously have to hold him which he doesn’t enjoy. 

he used to petting him and holding him, but he’s taken a complete 180 and i don’t know if i’ve traumatized him or what. he doesn’t mind playing with me today

i don’t mind if he turns out to be a less affectionate cat with age, but i wish he would stop running from me and such. i don’t know if i did something wrong or if maybe having another cat may be upsetting to him for some reason even though they get along really well?

we are being forced to leave the country due to some immigration issues - i won’t go into it but it’ll be 2 to 3 months depending on if our visa renewal is approved quick. 

i’ve already been stressing out on missing months of school and life in general, but now, the night before we leave, i’m starting to worry about our 2 cats. 

our only real choice is to keep them in this house. all the airlines to our destination will only ship the cats as cargo (not even necessarily on the same plane). nearby boarding facilities have come back to us saying they can’t keep them for such a long time. my parents told me to find one of my friends to catsit for us, and there was literally only one that was willing to do it.

the problem is, she’s really busy and it wouldn’t be fair for her to come out to the middle of nowhere (we live in the middle of nowhere) every day, so my parents told her every other day. i’m scared this isn’t often enough. 

the plan is my friend will come every other day and refill food bowls that we’ve put all over the house, and change the water too. 

only one of the cats is fond of playing, and my friend is free to use any of the cat toys lying around (we also have some toys that the cats can play with without assistance). 

the cats have already met her and though they aren’t in love, they don’t mind her. they’re good with rationing food and aren’t big drinkers. 

i still think it’s concerning to only have a person come once every two days - i have been bringing up the option of finding someone else to fill the gaps, but my mother shut me down and said it was fine and the cats would be okay. we also have the common problem of money (plane tickets are very expensive).

We're only on week 2 with him so early days.

&amp;#x200B;

My concern comes in with his meowing. He only aims these meows at me, he doesn't go to or meow at my wife even though she plays with him and feeds him too, I think its because the kitten knows she won't respond. We are both at home 24/7, I tend to respond because I'm worried that he's bored.

&amp;#x200B;

We're trying to set a routine of playing with him at set times, roughly 5 times a day for 15 mins - 45 depending on how free we are. Is this enough?

I'm an experienced cat owner and I know that many bed worries about cats are solved by the cats themselves (i.e. what if I roll over onto them? what if they get too hot/cold?

He often completely submerges himself, head and all, under the blanket and he has gotten up and wobbled himself out once he seemed to feel warm enough. But is CO2 poisoning something I need to be aware of for him? Are most cats aware of risks like that?

He's lived the majority of his life so far with me and my 3 other roommates while I was in school. In June of this year I graduated and moved back home with him and a couple weeks after the move he started vomiting a lot. During this period of about 2 weeks he vomited almost once a day if not more and couldn't really keep any food down. Took him to the vet and he had a small fever and they kept him overnight on an IV, gave him antibiotics, blood tests, and x-rays. While there he had no problems keeping food down and nothing was found on the blood tests or x-rays. The fever went away after his stay overnight and I was able to take him home with some medicine to sprinkle on his food for the following 2 weeks. 

Flash forward about 2 and a half months later and he starts vomiting again. Not nearly as much or intensely as the first time but still regularly enough for it to cause concern. I take him back to the vet and they say everything about him is healthy other than that he is a bit underweight ( He's been sitting at 8 lbs ever since July and he's usually 10). They give me deworming meds just in case + some probiotic powder for his food and sent him home. After that he doesn't vomit for about a month and a half but isn't really gaining back any weight. Then about a week ago he began vomiting again about every other day. 

During this time my family and I have tried wet food, single ingredient foods, expensive kibble, kibble for sensitive cats, grain-free kibble, and nothing has been able to stop him from vomiting. He really misses kibble even though most of the time that seems to trigger the vomit and he won't eat that much of his wet food. I've scheduled another vet appointment but I'm honestly so confused on what's been happening to him. 

Some other key things:

\- He never had anything like this happen in the 3 years I've had him BEFORE we moved this summer

\- Throughout all of this I haven't found any blood in any of his pee, poop, or vomit

\- He has the same levels of energy and acts completely normal after/between vomiting. Whenever he gets his daily zoomies he literally runs laps around the house

But yeah not sure if its a psychological thing, like the move stressed him out and now he has a really sensitive stomach? Or if it's something way more serious.

A very outgoing male and a shy calico. The calico is very cuddly and a tad possessive with me though. I just went through a very rough period with her, where she would tinkle in the bed, sometimes even straight on me while I was sleeping.  

I tried the scientific approach: changing each variable in isolation. Needless to say, I did A LOT of laundry over the last couple of weeks.

Steps:
(1) Checked for medical problems.
(2) Then I thought she was hungry at night and was trying to wake me up for food. So I bought automatic feeders.
(3) Took the roof of the litter boxes
(4) Put additional litter boxes
(5) changed the location of the litter boxes

All of this was to no avail until:

(6) I changed the (expensive) litter with cheap ass litter and the problem disappeared just like that. Problem solved...

Last weekend I had some company overnight. My love life is such that this is a very rare occasion, so the cats are not used to that 😄 We were sitting on the sofa and calico looked desperate to be involved: she saw me, my companion and her brother all sitting together, but was too scared and shy to come closer. You could see the panic in her face. She was finally brave enough to come stand on the sofa with us, where she quietly tinkled and left. We didn't even notice until half hour later.

When I found out, I gave her extra attention and treats and reassured her it's ok to have an accident. You can't imagine the purrs she gave me. I'd like to think I reassured her that she is still my number 1 girl :) Luckily this was a one-off and she resumed standard litter box duties right away.

We are now nearing the end of week 3, and her behavior is so interesting to me. She only comes out at night (unless I'm not home - I have cameras set up to watch her) and she lets me pet her while I'm laying in bed. She uses the cat tree I got her, sits in the window, and even plays with some toys; however, as soon as the sun rises or if she notices I'm awake, she goes RIGHT back underneath the bed and will not come out. It's like she's totally afraid of me and I can't get near her during the day, even though she lets me pet her and lay with her at night. Almost as if she thinks I'm a completely different entity during the day. I've tried playing with her, laying on the floor and talking to her, blocking off the bed (but she keeps finding ways under there), giving her treats - nothing.

Their stats are: CAT 1, female, 6-6.5 lbs, domestic medium hair, very dainty with a teeney neck and chest. CAT 2, male, domestic medium hair maine coon mix, definitely at least 13 lbs and growing, beefy chest and is heavy like an anvil.

My boyfriend and I live in an apartment with her. 
She experiences what seems in my opinion to be severe boredom.

She is spayed. She is up to date with the vet and no medical concerns.

We have several toys for her, but she just stares at them when I try to play with her. However, if I do nothing, she also just meows repeatedly for attention.

This is combined with her meowing because my boyfriend is about to be home and she’s excited. Unfortunately, I work from home and this is making things frustrating.

Finally, she begs for food and meows around her dinner time. After her dinner, my boyfriend is about to arrive home. So for about two hours straight every afternoon I am tortured. 
She also does it early in the morning when she’s awake and excited, and so unfortunately I don’t sleep very well.

Oh and we tried to get another cat. She hated the kitten and was territorial. So that’s out too.

She wouldn’t sleep, wouldn’t stop pacing, had blood in her stool from stress. Eventually she was put on 100mg of gabapentin daily which helped but now she’s settling in, she’s becoming aggressive with my partner and I.

When we met her in the shelter, they told us she was shy at first but loves people and is happy around other cats. That was it. Yesterday we emailed the shelter who advised they knew about these behaviours and actually had her on 200mg of gabapentin a day to keep her relaxed. We weren’t told any of this, we weren’t even sent home with any medications for her. They then told us that we are unable to return her if it’s not a good fit and it’ll be classified as a surrender which we will have to pay for. I was furious and distraught that this information was withheld from us.

We’re relatively new cat parents and we don’t have the experience to modify these behaviours, let alone try to do so without being told the extent of it from the beginning. We don’t want to give up on her and we’re taking her to our own vet tomorrow morning to see what they say but I feel AWFUL. She deserves a home that can give her the time and patience she deserves. 

We also told the shelter with Christmas coming up we will have family around (including young kids) and their solution was ‘put her in a room’. Which granted, we would likely have to do anyway because she cannot be around new people in a scenario like that but they felt so unsupportive.

First time poster here, apologies if I need to edit this in any way

I adopted a 6 (now 7 month) kitten about a month ago. She is adorable, but she seems to be bored no matter what I do. She’s started displaying behavioral issues like biting hands/feet and biting and scratching furniture. We have many scratching posts, but I think she’s learned that scratching and biting furniture=someone is going to pull her away and give her attention, so she continues to bite and scratch them. I’m going to try double sided tape to get her to stop that. But the bigger issue is her biting. I know that when a kitten bites it means they are bored, so whenever she does that I try to play with her, but she often times ignores the toys I try to use and keeps going for hands and feet! I have multiple dangly toys (stuffed things attached to a stick with a string, unsure what the correct name is) a few catnip filled stuff toys that I throw for her to chase, as well as a motion activated toy and some noisy balls on a track that she likes to bat around. Sometimes dangling or throwing something works, but a lot of times she seems barely interested in it, she’ll lay on her back and bat it around a little and then get bored and try to attack our hands and feet again. I know she likes these toys, because sometimes we get a great session in and she really leaps for it and wears herself out, but a lot of time nothing I do gets her interested in playing with anything but our flesh. 

I’m really not sure what I’m doing wrong here. I had a cat my entire childhood but she was a lazy rag doll, I’m clearly a bit out of my depth with a tortie kitten. It’s started to become a genuine issue, potentially damaging my nice furniture is bad enough, but I don’t know how to work from home when she demands constant attention yet doesn’t care for playing with anything but my hands and feet!

Her spay appointment was on 8th November but it was postponed to 6th December. She is currently on her second heat and literally peeing on everything that's made of fabric. Not spraying, just urinating normally by squatting. I have tried my best to clean up after her using enzyme cleaners but she just keeps peeing anyway. She does pee in the litter box when I put her manually and I do keep the litter box clean.

She actually had that habit of peeing outside her litter box since I adopted her at 3 months old but it wasn't as frequent. Anytime she saw any clothing on the bed(even a blanket) or on the floor, she'd pee on it. We managed to get it under control by moving the blankets and clothes from the bed immediately after we're done though she still peed on the couch sometimes. She also has a habit of holding her pee in as long as she can. I heard UTIs could also be the cause and talked to the vet about it but she ruled it out.

So now on top of her constant yowling and screaming combined with the frequent peeing habit is driving everyone nuts. I love her to death but I cannot keep cleaning after her multiple times every single day. 

Will spaying get rid of this peeing problem? I heard the longer a cat is allowed to pee like that during heat, the harder it is to get rid of this habit even after spaying. Her appointment is still 3 weeks away and that means there'll be another heat after the current one which means more peeing if she hasn't developed the habit already. I'm so stressed out.

I live in a small one bed apartment - I have a single cat, she’s about 2 years old. She’s friendly and quite attached to me but she’s equally friendly and curious when people come over. 

I’ve been on vacations since I got her, and so far my bf crashes at mine to look after her which means she’s had no changes to her routine. Recently I’ve been sleeping over at my bfs from time to time but still making sure her feeding schedule is undisturbed (to get her used to spending nights alone). She’s been fine with that too

My question is, I’m comfortable leaving her with drop in visits from a sitter (once or twice a day) if I go away for 2-4 days. But have you guys left your cat at home with only drop in visits for about 30 min for 2 weeks at a time? I could also drop her off at boarders I’ve found on Rover but idk what the better option is since I’ve heard cats prefer to stay in their space. But I’m worried that she’ll get lonely all by herself for that long. 

Also do you guys get one drop in visit per day or two? My cats fed wet food twice a day which is the issue if I go away— I’ll have to get someone to drop in twice a day",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,117448,public,self,Leaving cats while on vacation,0,[],0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/yv2hx6/leaving_cats_while_on_vacation/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

My BF and I have a cat together and we will be going on a two-week vacation overseas soon. It will be the first time he will be away from home for so long and consequently the first time the cat will be staying at a friend’s flat.

Besides the basics (litter box, litter, and food) this is what we are planning on taking with her to our friend’s flat:
- her blanket
- one blanket we have on the sofa that has our smell
- one of my t-shirts and one of my bf’s T-Shirt
- two of her favourite toys
- treats
- her cat grass
- the basket she sleeps in during the day
- a scratching post

Is there anything else we could take with her that would make her stay more comfortable?

I’m also worried about the timing of taking her over to our friend’s flat. My instinct is to have her as long as possible with us and only take her there as the last thing. But I think it might end up being too stressful for everyone involved. My BF is of the same opinion and suggested taking her there ca. 48h before our flight, so we can even stay there a bit for her to settle in. What would be best?

Thanks a lot in advance for any help!",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,117431,public,self,Cat will stay over with friend during vacation.

They are roughly a year apart and have been together since I adopted the youngest at eight weeks. They sleep together, groom each other, eat side by side, and other than one particular spot on the cat tower aren't territorial.

I went away this weekend, from Friday to Sunday. They had automatic feeders and my sister checked on them Saturday (I've since checked, she said they were behaving normally). I got home this evening, they didn't come greet me at the door. First I found the older one, then the younger one came in the room but they started hissing at each other. The younger one was also soaking wet (I think they fought near the water bowl as there was a huge puddle), had scratches and was acting terrified while the older one was puffing up and acting like he'd never seen the younger one in his life.

I know this can happen when cats are separated, say a vet visit or something but it has never happened with them after a vet visit or in the rate occasion the older one gets out the house. There was nothing that would have changed how they smelled or seemed to each other. Just my absence and I've left for the weekend before. 

They've been separated since I've been home, the baby mostly with me since he was the most shaken up, though he seems much calmer now. They ate on each a side of a door for dinner. But the older one saw me moving the baby (we were rotating rooms so everyone was set up for the night but isolated rather than their usual run of the house) and he puffed up and started hissing again.

I'm not asking for medical advice or anything, I am just frustrated and need advice from other cat owners. My roommate has a cat and she is the sweetest cat ever. This past summer we moved into an apartment and the cat began peeing all over the stairs. This was extremely abnormal since she never did this in our old apartment and is often well behaved and relaxed. I know the peeing outside of the litter box can be caused by stress from the new environment, plus my roommate has been extremely inconsistent with cleaning the litter box. I made it very clear that I am worried about the cat, the unclean litter box's impact on the cat, the damages to the stairs, and that the cat pee smell is completely unbearable. Everyone that I bring over makes comments about the smell and my friends who are cat owners tell me that the smell will most likely never come out. Due to this, we had to get the carpet torn out of the stairs. The peeing stopped for a bit but then started again, except this time on the wood that was under the carpet. I begged my roommate to take her to the vet or find remedies to help the cat to stop peeing on the stairs. My roommate then buys some UTI medicine online and says that's the most she can do. Also, I forgot to mention that we have tried every form of cleaner to get the cat pee out. It doesn't get rid of the smell, but it does conceal it for a day or two. With all of this being said, I am so stressed. I have tried everything to make it clear to my roommate that this cat needs medical attention and the cat pee smell is spreading all over the apartment. She responds by saying that she's doing everything she can and she is already dealing with too much in regards to schoolwork. I am so tired of worrying about this.

The hallway is closed off by doors and theres no way for him to escape so we let him sniff around and explore for a couple minutes then brought him back inside in our unit. Ever since then, he will sit at the front door and cry and meow and it seems as though he wants to go back out to the hallway. I try to distract him with toys, treats, anything. But after a couple minutes he’ll just go back to crying at the door. It gets quite frustrating hearing him yell at us for hours on end. I’m nervous if I let him back out there, i’m encouraging the behavior that crying at door=getting what he wants. I don’t know if that makes me sound like a bad cat mom but I am just not a fan of him being out in that hallway in case another tenant walks in and they get upset or my cat runs out the building once they open the outside door.

The humane society (Toronto based shelter rescue) assessed these two cats and concluded that they are bonded so we were excited to take both home. 

One is female, 3 years old. Spayed. The other is a boy, 2 years old and neutered recently. 

They seem fine on their own, super affectionate with us, playful, not stressed at all. Eating well, drinking lots of water. Beyond that though, they seem to avoid each other. He’s fairly indifferent to her but she actively dislikes him any time he’s near her. She will growl, hiss and swat at him if he gets close. Him being younger and full of bouncy energy, and our place being a condo, this causes issues. 

We don’t have any experience with bonded cats so we don’t know if this is going to change as they get more comfortable. We also don’t know if we should trust the assessment of the place we got them from. They’ve been radio silent on the concerns we have posed to them and are not calling us back.

My biggest concern is we live in a 700sq foot condo in the city. There is enough room here for them to avoid each other and have their space but keeping two unbonded cats in a space this small for the next decade or more seems unfair to them.

when she sees that I have treats, she begins huffing and hissing and her eyes get huge and she lunges at me whenever I get my hand close enough to give her a treat. she often bites my hand as I try to offer her a treat. what's weird about this is that she does not exhibit this behavior with her regular food (which she does seem to love since she's very prompt about demanding her food and gets very excited when I'm filling her bowl) to the point where I can take food out of the bowl while she's eating and she doesn't even blink.

she was a stray and I imagine that that's why she has some food aggression - I just can't tell how to solve this. if I withhold a treat because she bit me she gets really agitated, but hardly any less agitated as she is after she eats one treat and expects another. honestly it scares me to give her treats because of how aggressive she can get.

Both are spayed. We took Banshee in because Trisk seems like she would benefit from some feline company, and Banshee was causing some behavioral problems when left alone during the day. We had hoped that Banshee would be a good playmate for Trisk, and Trisk would keep Banshee company when there weren't any humans in the house.

We brought her home about 3 weeks ago, and we have our house partitioned off into two sides using baby gates with a thick blanket draped over them. We unfortunately don't have any doors, as we live in a trailer. Trisk and Banshee have had minimal contact through the baby gate, and Trisk seems fine with Banshee, but Banshee is showing a lot of aggression towards Trisk. We regularly have to redirect her from trying to claw and growl at the baby gate, and over the past few days she's learned how to knock it over. Every time she does, she goes for Trisk, hissing and snarling. Trisk seems more confused than anything, and just runs to a safer spot and stares at her instead of trying to fight back. We always separate them as soon as we can when this happens, but Banshee has mauled my hand a few times now for that, and I don't know how to get her to understand that Trisk isn't a threat and leave her alone.

Trisk has met plenty of other cats from her time before we adopted her, as she was part of the local cat colony. She also adored our 18yo cat that we no longer have. Banshee, as far as I know, hasn't met any other cats besides her parents/siblings, but she loves dogs and people, and actively enjoys being picked up except when she's being aggressive towards Trisk. I've seen a lot of people recommend food rewards for being calm towards the other cat, but we haven't found any treats that Banshee is interested in. Neither cat is food aggressive, and they're fed on opposite sides of the house.

At this point, my partner and I plan on building a temporary door so that Banshee can no longer knock over the baby gates. However, that doesn't help the fact that she still seems to hate Trisk. Is there anything we can do to calm her down?

So I have two cats (1 year old M and 10 month old F). They have been living together for almost a year now. We did slow and proper introductions and they were great together (still are, for the most part). My male cat has always been super playful and rambunctious, my female cat is more chill and quiet. Over the past 2 months, my male cat has been playing rough with my female cat, he's been hunting her and chasing her to the point where she will hiss and hide. However, they share food and cuddle and lick each other all the time too, so it's pretty confusing.

They have never gotten into a full on fight (i.e. no blood drawn and my male cat will usually back away) BUT over the past 2 weeks my female cat has pooped 3 times under the couch/my bed, depending. I think it's related to this hunting behaviour my male cat has been doing (maybe she is afraid to use the box?) This has never ever been an issue before and i'm just not sure what to do. For context, the litter boxes are covered and they have never been an issue. I have two litter boxes and they are far apart in my apartment in quiet areas.

She has some zoomies every once in a while and she likes to stay in the same room as her people when we are home, but this doesn't seem needy, just pleasantly affectionate. My partner has intimated that they would love to adopt a second cat, and I'm sure I would love a second one as well, but am worried that adding a new cat might disrupt the routine and balance that my current cat now has. I was told my cat has acted 'sassy' before towards new cats before she got to know them.

My heart breaks writing this.

I have three cats, all indoors only. In 2018, when two of the cats were 8(Female) and 7(Male), we adopted an 8 week old kitten(Male). No one at the adoption agency consulted us about the age gap between our cats potentially causing aggression and issues (We later learned from a vet that the recommended age gap for cats is only 2 years).

After a three week isolation period, the cats met face to face, and aside from typical kitten energy occasionally spooking the older cats, they seemed to get along well.

When the kitten turned 1 year old, we moved to a home, doubling our square footage. Overtime, the kitten seemed to become more aggressive to the older cats.

It is now to the point where the other cats will hiss and run away from the kitten, as he will attack them randomly, and we're not talking a play fight, we're talking a fight fight. It's very clear that he may need to be a solo cat, as he has become very territorial.

We have tried bumping up play time, adding more places for the cats to get off the ground, and now he's been isolated into an office space for about 6 weeks, to attempt ""reintroduction"", at the advice of our vet.

Out vet also recently prescribed liquid alprazolam for him to go on, and after watching videos of cats on this medicine, I do NOT feel comfortable with him on this for an extended period of time.

I am at the point where I would like to rehome him. The adoption agency said they will rehome him no problem, and list that he needs to be a single cat.

My husband is overwhelmingly against this. He does not want to give him up, as he has dealt with a lot of pet loss in his life. I am terrified he will resent me if we decide to rehome the younger cat.

Does anyone have any other suggestions we can try to help keep the younger cat entertained, and keep the peace among our cats? We have two cat trees, tables under windows so they can look out, several toys, treats, and occasional catnip playtime.",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,117325,public,self,"Cat aggressive to older cats.

She’s never had an issue with her litter box, pretty good temperament, and after a vet appointment, is known to be in perfect health. I posted on here when I first got her to ask for general advice, and I’ve followed it. The only problem is that she will not stop tearing up the carpet.

I grew up in a house with carpet with three cats, two of which came to us declawed, one of which we got as a kitten and were able to keep her claws. In all the years I had them, they never had issues with clawing up the carpet. Ever since I adopted my new cat, the carpet on the inside of my bedroom door has been torn up day and night. She’s kept inside my room when I sleep, or when no one else is home, but aside from that, usually has free roam of the house.

At first, I thought it was the scratching post. Bought her a new post that she took to immediately, and loves to scratch. 

She kept scratching the carpet, so I got a horizontal scratching post that I fixed to the door. Came home to the post ripped off of the door and the carpet torn up to the floorboards. 

Sprayed a dose of feliway before I left, and came back to more shredded carpet. Sprayed about three doses, and still, more carpet that she’s torn up.

I caved and got one of the plastic mats that fix to the carpet, and it worked for about a week before she started tearing up the carpet around the border of the mat.

I’m sitting with her right now in my room, in front of my door, and she keeps hopping around my legs to tear at the carpet as if I’m not here.

I’m at my breaking point with her. I can’t leave her alone to go to class without worrying about how much carpet she’s ripping up while I’m gone. Her litter box is always clean before I leave, her water filled up, and her food fresh. I trim her nails on schedule so they don’t get too long. She has toys around my room to play with, and a nice scratching post I know she likes the feel of.

She has a more independent personality, so feeding and playtime are when I feel that I actually bond with her. The only thing I'm worried about with the automatic feeder is that she will lose that bond with me because I will no longer be the direct food source. 

I have researched a little about automatic, microchip, and smart feeders, and found some pretty good brands like PetLibro and Dogness.

I've had Milky since she was a few weeks old and safe for some visits elsewhere she has been an only child so far. So having a little playmate to actually play catch with was great for her. It was clearly playful, since they reversed roles a lot and never gave any signs of distress.

Cookie is clearly traumatized from her time as a stray and took (and is still taking) time to warm up to me. By now Cookie clearly adores both of us - she wants to be around us every waking and sleeping minute, napping on my legs and always coming over to see what Milky is up to.

Problem:

Milky seems to be starting to have regrets. She's withdrawing more from us, spending more time in my roommate's room (when she rarely left my side before). It doesn't help that when she comes over to ask for play or snuggles, Cookie wants to know what's up and engage with her. I see Milky rejecting Cookie more, smacking her away when she comes close and yesterday we even had a brief, tense staredown. I broke it up by redirecting their attention, but that spooked me.

I assume that the novelty has worn off and Milkyway wishes she could return to her old routine by now. I notice this in how she has picked some old behavior back up, like begging me for play even when Cookie is zooming in the background. Sometimes she approaches me and looks downright disappointed to see Cookie around.

Is this something I need to worry about? How can I make this easier for her? Do any of you have experience with this kind of reaction and can tell me how long it might last?

I miss my Milkybaby, especially when she stays away almost all day.

What I'm already trying:

I gently ward Cookie off when Milkyway comes to cuddle with me. It does not give her enough calm to continue for long though.

I check up on Milky sometimes, just seeking her out and asking her if she's okay. Petting her a little if she seems fine with it.

I try to engage both of them in play at the same time. For example, I throw something for Milkyway, then practice a trick with Cookie. When Milky comes back, I throw something for her again.

I try to make sure they never have to compete for resources, especially food and snacks. Both of them are pretty foodmotivated, so I do my best to always provide enough and distribute it enough that no tension arises.

And I've bought a pheromone diffuser that should be effective on the whole apartment. I already used those pheromones for the introduction and that seemed to help them.",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,117313,public,self,"2yo cat seems to get sick of 6mo kitten, what do?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/yu9l3k/2yo_cat_seems_to_get_sick_of_6mo_kitten_what_do/,all_ads,6,,,,transparent,a0609c4c-d692-11ec-9de9-3ec6d0d500d9,dark,,,,,

I’m 22F, and recently became the owner of a 12-week-old ragdoll kitten. 

I am not a first-time cat owner but technically I am since living on my own away from home! I live with my friend who also has some experience owning cats with her family. 

I did some research into the best cat breeds to keep indoors as we live in a city on a busy street, and recently purchased a 12-week-old rag doll girl kitten, she’s very well-behaved, purrs constantly and sleeps all day pretty much - but I worry that being indoors won’t be enough for her! She has bursts of energy where she tries to nibble plants and wires and scratch things but so far I have been around to redirect and distract her with toys - I just worry about when I’m not. I also worry the location of my flat is too noisy for her, although she seems ok. I live above a busy, noisy shop also, which might not be ideal. 

Our flat isn’t tiny but we don’t have a garden and will have to keep all the windows closed at all times in case she gets out. I’m not sure if it’s normal to feel this way but I’m incredibly anxious about leaving her alone, and just owning a cat in general.  

I work part-time, around 3-4 8-hour shifts a week and am also a student as is my flatmate. I did consider this before getting her but my flatmate and I both concluded there is almost always one of us at home within a 4-hour window at the very least. 

It is only day 3 now and I’ve only left her alone once for just under an hour - she seemed ok, but she was asleep. when she’s awake and I leave the room she cries, which worries me even more about leaving her alone! I’ve cat-proofed the flat as much as possible but I’m worried about things falling on her etc if she plays with them. I also plan on getting netting for the windows just in case. 

She has food and water out in the rooms she has access to (currently only my room and the living room/kitchen area), and a cat tree in the living room. When I go out I shut my bedroom door just to confine her to one area and minimise any potential damage! I hope this is ok? I’m not sure if this is irrational but we have one of those induction hob things that stays hot for a while after you use it and I’m worried about her jumping on it (she hasn’t yet even jumped on the counter), also jumping around and getting stuck somewhere she can’t get out and consuming plants she’s not supposed to, I’ve put them all up high and out of reach but I’m still paranoid. This was never a problem with my other cats so I’m not sure if I’m overthinking things! 

I’m not sure if I’ve taken on more than I can cope with or if these anxieties will ease over time. I’m terrified to actually go to work and leave her alone properly, I couldn’t relax at all just going to the shops! 

I do also feel slightly guilty about her having no access to the outside and no other cats to play with. The only reason I was able to purchase such a lovely cat was that I inherited just enough money from my grandmother passing away to invest in a cat, which I’ve wanted for a while, and she loved cats so it just felt right. However, I am stressing about not being a good enough home for her. I know it’s only been a few days but I haven’t really been able to relax, the first night I had her I didn’t really sleep because every time she would get up and walk around I’d bolt up to check on her. I’m being hyper-vigilant but I’m paranoid about accidentally leaving a window open, the stove on, a door open, a knife or something she shouldn’t eat on the counter etc. is this normal and if so, does the constant pet paranoia go away? 

I am fortunate enough to have the safety net of my mum, who is desperate to have her, we have had some pet and human losses over the past year that has affected us all, but especially my mum and she misses a small fluffy thing to cuddle, in her words. The cat they have now is much more aloof whereas this kitten never leaves my side and is much more of a lap cat, I know they’d love and mutually benefit from each other’s company. However, my dad isn’t so keen. They live somewhat near me but in a much safer area where she would have another cat to play with, access to the outside and a much larger indoor area too. My parents are also almost always home as they WFH, unlike me. My mum is ready to take her in a heartbeat but I would almost feel embarrassed and ashamed about taking on such a responsibility and not being able to handle it, but I also just want what’s best for the cat - which is what’s giving me such anxiety! In theory, I would plan to take her back when I am no longer a student and/or move to somewhere with a garden. 

I just worry I’ve bitten off more than I can chew. When I think about my parents temporarily (when I say temporary I mean a over a year, so she won’t be going back and forth much) adopting her it brings me a great sense of relief if I’m honest, and I’d see her frequently. I might be overthinking it all as it is early days and she is only 12 weeks so she’s bound to calm down a bit and it should get easier, but since I’ve had her in my care I have an almost constant sense of anxiety. Also just as a side note, another reason why I am even considering giving her to my parents is that my having a cat is that it pretty much eliminates the possibility of my boyfriend having his dog over to the flat that he shares with an ex, which is a shame.

Since last week (November 8), I started bottle-feeding her with both gruel and formula milk. I've tried training her to jump on her plate (hopefully to atleast smell the food) but she would just run around it. I also tried putting some of the wet food directly to her mouth to which she would try to taste and munch, but never on her own volition. Since it's been 5 days since her first taste of gruel, I tried putting the mix again on the plate in small amounts. She started licking some of it on her own, but not all. I tried placing the leftovers on her spoon and she would sloppily lick it, but then again, not all. So I guess, my question is, is our pacing normal? Or are we doing the weaning process too slowly? I'm scared of forcing her to feed because she might develop some aversion to her wet food if I do. Also, do you have other ideas or techniques that you could share to us?

As for the gruel mixture (the one on her bottle), I usually just mix 1/2 tbsp of her milk to 2 1/2 tbsp of water, then to 1 1/2 tbsp of wet food (Royal Canin Mother and Baby Cat starter food). As for the one on her plate, I usually mix 1.5L of her gruel and a small amount of wet food for thicker consistency (when I relied solely on her pre-made gruel mixture, she almost inhaled the milk so I was afraid to make the consistency thinner because she might aspirate).",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,117301,public,self,How long does the weaning process usually last?,0,[],0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/yu51xk/how_long_does_the_weaning_process_usually_last/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

When i first got him, my roommate had a cat which he saw as his friend. When I got a new job in my home town and we had to move into my parents house he got along really well with my brothers cat. 

Now the same night we moved into our own place, we got out new kitty, she about 10 months old, ill refer to her and they transitioned well enough together. We have noticed at night that A likes to mess with P at night he might be older but in reality  he acts like a baby. Early this morning we heard P cry, she never cries and so my partner got up and we noticed A was hovering over P . Upon further inspection we noticed that P had used the floor instead of the litter box. My partner said that He had noticed even earlier that On top of the little box, but he didn’t see Her in it. Now we know she was and he was bugging her which led her to using the floor. We put A in one of the crates we have while my partner got ready for work and P was able to use the little box free of intrusion. 
We are unsure of what to do, they eat and drink out of the same bowls even at the same time and during the day.  He doesn’t bug her when she goes to use the little box during the day either but we don’t know how to stop it at night when we aren’t awake.

Few questions:
- are there any alternatives to tags and/ or collars? I want to give as little opportunity for him to get snagged on anything. 

- any tips for resettling an indoor cat? (I know about creating a scent, bringing familiar smells inside and outside areas, keeping him in for a good few weeks to rehome)

- there is one other neutered male cat on the land (very nice boy but hasn’t met jetpack), how can I respect his home whilst integrating jetpack, or is it not my business?

Eventually, that developed into a few scratches in the air over each side of her dish, eventually turning to one or two scratches on the rim of the bowl or nearby desk. We talked to one of the women from the rescue and she said that her cat did it too and that she was just being dramatic. We did a little search online and found that cats from shelters could have that behavior from having to share food. We thought it would eventually go away, and it wasn't hurting anything, so we let it go. Now it's gotten to the point where any time she eats or uses the bathroom, she sits on her back feet and uses both front paws to quickly and loudly scratch on any nearby walls nonstop for minutes on end. I'm not sure why she does it; it doesn't seem like the point is really to cover anything anymore. It feels like a compulsion. She does it and she does it until she feels like she's done it enough. But she does it very often and it's gotten so bad that it wakes us up every time and tends to keep us awake until she's finished, to the point where we often have a hard time finally going to sleep once she has finished. It's starting to really effect our sleep. We have one other cat, but he's not very competitive about food. In fact, he often steps back and waits for her to finish eating if she comes to eat while he's at the bowl. They get along very well. We have a new cat tree thing near their food that has scratching posts as every post, but they don't use it at all. She does have other things that she sharpens her claws on though, so I don't think that's the issue here. I'm not sure how to stop this behavior, largely because I don't know why she's doing it. I tried putting  wash cloths near the food dish in hopes that she would cover her food with them and be satisfied, but she hasn't touched them.

She has her own bedroom with:

• a TV (i play birds or a string game she likes on it) 

• 3 cat towers (one infront of a window)
• a puzzle toy

• scattered small toys

• a door hanging mouse on a string she can jump and play with

• a crinkle tunnel 

• a ripple rug she can jump in and out of and play in

• a 3 tier corrugated cardboard house 

• one of those 3 tier ball towers they hit the ball around

• an old iPad that plays little games on it 24/7 she can play with

• a cat tower infront of another window

•little small mouse toys and ball toys

• an interactive toy that’s like a whack a mole kind of thing 

In the living room she has a scratcher toy, another 3 tier ball tower toy and another cat tree in front of a big bay window. 

And in the kitchen she has another cat tree in front of another big window.

I could really use some advice from you since I am at my wits' end.

I have two female cats (both 12 years old) and have been living in the same ground floor apartment for 3 years. For about two months or so though, I've noticed that my neighbors next door have  been complaining to each other (not to me yet) about the cats scratching around in the litter box at night.

The walls are paper-thin; I can hear my upstairs neighbors coughing, walking, when they talk in a normal voice etc. and hear the elevator going up and down outside my apartment door for reference.

Since they have an open tray, I've tried switching to a closed box with a swinging door three weeks ago, but they haven't used it yet, even with the door and lid removed. I put a rug underneath the tray and put some fabric on the sides to try and reduce the noise, but the changes are minimal because the cats usually don't scratch the edge but the actual litter.
I empty the clumps at least twice a day and always before night and regularly change the litter, so it shouldn't be due to an unclean litter box.

Unfortunately, I am a heavy sleeper and oftentimes (if even) only wake up right after they finished or when I hear my neighbors complain. The times I do notice them scratching (my guess is it's about 1-2 mins at a time, around twice a night), I call the cats so that they come to me and pet them to try and reinforce a shorter scratching time, but the damage is usually already done. I'm also worried that they will get the wrong idea and stop using the tray.

The litter tray is in the bathroom and the door is unlocked but not open so that the cats can go in and out. Obviously, I can't block access to the tray at night as they need to use it, but I also don't want to be evicted from the apartment due to noise pollution, as there is a ""quiet time"" from 10pm to 6pm. 

I have tried to eliminate all other noise sources and started covering the scratching posts at night and leave out food for the night so that they don't meow. They are seniors and almost never run around at night. But I just don't know how to combat this problem and the neighbors seem to get more and more agitated and I am really sceade that they will complain to the landlord if they haven't already. I understand my neighbors, but I haven't found a way to fix this yet.

The cats don't play together, that's a time Bandit will bully her out of playing. I have figured out how Bandit loves to play.
The problem is I know Piper wants to play but I can't work out how to get her to engage in play.
Feathers and tissue paper will get her going but she stops after about a minute and seems uninterested, not even looking at the toy.
I know the 4 stages of play time.
Watch, stalk, catch then 'kill', I think?
I have tried everything.

He, like most cats, really likes his snackies. However, him eating them and getting his full enjoyment out of it started as him liking it when I watch him eat. His name is ButtButt, he’s 8 years old,  I’ve had him for 7 years, and he likes me to tell him what a good EaterButt he is when he’s eating. 

However, this has now evolved to him only eating his snackies while I’m bent way over, reaching under his undercarriage and rubbing his front armpits/chest and upper tummy while I both talk to him the entire time and/or sing to him while I do said undercarriage rubbing. 

As soon as I stop and start walking away then he’ll stop eating and wander away. So just to be clear, it’s only with his snackies, my participation is not necessary during him eating anything else and he’s definitely not underfed, he’s got a little bit of chonk on him. 

How do I break it to my cat that him eating and enjoying his snackies does not need to be a two person event?

I'm not sure of her exact age but the vet estimated around 8. She is beautiful, sweet and affectionate a lot of the time but she is also a bit aggressive. If I walk past her too often when she is in the hallway or on the couch she will swipe at me. She also occasionally chases me around the house and playfully bites and swipes my legs. I don't think either of these things are actual aggression, I suspect she may need more play. The trouble I'm having is that she seems to get bored quickly when I play with her. I use a laser toy to get her very excited then I switch to a piece of string on a stick which she loves. I try to make her run as much as possible and climb as much as possible during the play sessions but she gets bored quite quickly. I have tried to use different toys with her but she is only interested in the laser and the string. I tried to tie a bird toy to the string but she wasn't interested. I would like for her to be able to properly bite and kick and ""kill"" what she ""hunts"" when we play but she can't do that with the laser or the string really. We also sometimes play hide and seek where I hide and poke my head out to let her see me then she runs to me and catches me (doesnt swipe or bite me during this). She enjoys this but my house is small so she gets bored quickly with this too. 


She's an indoor only cat, she can look out windows all day and I leave the back door open so she can look into the garden while I'm home, when I go to work and when I sleep I leave puzzle feeders out for her. I'm not sure what else I can do to give her more stimulation and play with her better to hopefully reduce her swiping and chasing me.

i recently (3 weeks ago) made the decision to get a kitten for a variety of reasons, two of them being so that kiwi can have a playmate and some company since he’s very playful, and also in the hopes that having a more sociable cat around might help his anxiety a bit in the long run.

new kitten’s name is fig, also male and about 12 weeks old now. it’s actually been going really well between them, they play all the time, sleep near each other (haven’t cuddled yet but i think that’s not necessarily a red flag), kiwi will also groom fig which usually turns into more playing. basically it feels like things are going great!

the only thing is that kiwi is wayyy less vocal with me than he used to be. he still meows at me from time to time and makes a lot of smaller meows and trilling noises with fig but it’s nowhere near as much as it was before. i’m not really seeing any other behavioral changes and he seems to enjoy fig’s presence and i show him plenty of affection so he doesn’t get jealous. i have a theory that maybe some of his meowing from before was out of loneliness and so less meowing now is actually a good thing, but the paranoid cat mom in me just wants some other opinions!

Miso and Egg have been hissing at each other. obviously the baby, which was expected, but they’ve been very angry with each other too. i can’t quite figure out why, and it’s bothering me as they have been very close since Miso was young.

in addition, they get upset if they even hear the baby, so keeping him out of sight doesnt even really help. we moved him out of the bathroom (because he has a URI and is so miserable that he cries all the time), and into a covered playpen into the living room to hopefully fix this problem.

Next week I'm doing a 13hr drive in one day to the top of the rocky mountains from basically sea level. I'm already worried about how he'll react to the elevation change. Logistically and financially, my best option is to take him even though I wish I didn't have to.

The vet tech recommended I let him roam in the cab and gave me tips to practice with him. I'm in the car with him now, parked. He stopped crying when I opened his crate. He looked around a bit but has been in his crate mostly. I've always been nervous about him being out in the car. Do the safety concerns outweigh his and my sanity? 

He can't wear a collar because his hair tangles horribly. I'm trying to train him on a harness and leash but he's not taking to it very well. Any tips to getting him comfortable wearing it?

He ended up having a urinary blockage and was really sick, but he has since recovered and has been really healthy. My parents and I figured this was the cause of maybe why he has been pooping out of the box, but now that he’s perfectly healthy, he still keeps doing it, no matter what. Our carpet is completely destroyed.

We’ve tried many things. Getting a new litter box. Using pet repellent. Blocking off the area where he poops on the carpet but that also didn’t work. Moving his litter box to the place he poops. I even picked up his poop and placed it in the litter box to see if that would work by redirecting the scent, but of course, that didn’t work.

This one vet recommended pheromones, but I don’t wanna waste money because I feel like it’s a bunch of bullshit if the other things didn’t work. I’m running out of options at this point, and I love my family cat, but our basement is completely destroyed and smells like shit, and they’re more fed up than I am and my parents have made me the “executive poop picker upper.” I have to pick up multiple piles of a poop every other day, and I don’t know how long this is going to go on for. 

I’m assuming it’s feline dementia since the urinary blockage thing has been resolved given he’s super healthy otherwise now for his age.

Where do I go from here? Let him keep pooping how he has been until he dies? I don’t want him to die, and i think he has a few more years in him given his condition and energy. But my parents and I suspect he may be peeing outside the litter box, but I can’t smell anything nor can my parents.

He’s about 6 years old now and doesn’t typically like to play or cuddle. I got him from Craigslist when he was maybe 8 weeks old from a family with a young child. They originally got the kitten as a Christmas gift for the kid.

He ended up having a urinary blockage and was really sick, but he has since recovered and has been really healthy. My parents and I figured this was the cause of maybe why he has been pooping out of the box, but now that he’s perfectly healthy, he still keeps doing it, no matter what. Our carpet is completely destroyed.

We’ve tried many things. Getting a new litter box. Using pet repellent. Blocking off the area where he poops on the carpet but that also didn’t work. Moving his litter box to the place he poops. I even picked up his poop and placed it in the litter box to see if that would work by redirecting the scent, but of course, that didn’t work.

This one vet recommended pheromones, but I don’t wanna waste money because I feel like it’s a bunch of bullshit if the other things didn’t work. I’m running out of options at this point, and I love my family cat, but our basement is completely destroyed and smells like shit, and they’re more fed up than I am and my parents have made me the “executive poop picker upper.” I have to pick up multiple piles of a poop every other day, and I don’t know how long this is going to go on for. 

I’m assuming it’s feline dementia since the urinary blockage thing has been resolved given he’s super healthy otherwise now for his age.

Where do I go from here? Let him keep pooping how he has been until he dies? I don’t want him to die, and i think he has a few more years in him given his condition and energy. But my parents and I suspect he may be peeing outside the litter box, but I can’t smell anything nor can my parents.

I have had my resident cat (10yr female) for about 2 years, she was fostered with several other cats when we adopted her, so has lived with cats before but it has been 2 years since then.
2 months ago we made the decision to adopt another cat (2ish yr  male). He has also lived with other cats before and no concerns with him.


So we brought him home and to my knowledge we followed Jackson Galaxy to a T. Scent swapped, site swapped, other side of the door feeding until they were consistently eating beside each other no hissing. Moved on to eat, play, love. We know we've got a bit of an age and energy gap so we play with the new cat, and resident cat (and she gets lots of pets when she's loafing, same as before). We also play/treat both in new cat's basecamp and rest of the house to balance out territorial business.


Here's where I'm not sure if it's going wrong and if anyone has experience with something similar. They're fine 80% of the time, sleeping in the same room, passing in hallways, scrambling with zoomies past the other. Then every so often my resident cat just gets weird. She'll find an ambush spot on the stairs or something and go to chase/swat the new cat (doesn't look playful, her eyes will be dilated and ears back). Sometimes she'll be rolling over onto her back, in front of the new cat, and slow blinking at him, and then she'll randomly flip her top and chase/swat him away when it doesn't look like he's even moved or there's been some other noise to startle her. 


So Reddit, what do you think? Does this kind of behavior mellow out? Have we moved too fast somewhere along Jackson galaxy's advice? Do we keep doing what we're doing?

- still separated overnight

I’ve only ever left him one time for about two weeks and had a friend come over and she would hang out at my apartment most days. 

He’s a very social cat. He follows me around more often than not. Meows very loudly every time I (or my neighbors) come home. Even when I step out to pick up a package for less than a minute. 

I’m worried that he’ll feel too lonely if my friends can only stop by to feed him and clean his litter. I don’t think they’d be able to spend much time with him consistently every day. 

I have a friend who lives a bit far from me who said he could take him in. I haven’t been to his place yet though, so I’m not sure what the environment looks like. He has one roommate. He’s one of the few who will be around for the holidays. I feel like I’d need to see his place first. I’d probably also have to bring over some of my cat’s things (on top of food, water fountain, litter box, etc.) so he feels comfortable. I think this would be a good option so my cat is surrounded by people most of the time, but I know how cats hate changing environments. Plus if he stays at my place, I can keep an eye on him with the pet cams I have set up.

I posted here and the advice was to get a water fountain. Well, she treated the water fountain as a water park, playing in the water and getting both her and the carpet soaked (i live in a carpeted apartment). We got a mat under the fountain but she flicked the water beyond the mat. After two weeks maybe we took the motor out of the fountain and used it as just a big water bowl instead, hoping that it was big enough for her to not tip over. That worked fine for a while, but more recently she has started to dip her paws in the water and play with the water anyway. I tried to counteract that by putting less water in, but that just enabled her to flip the bowl over and make a bigger mess.

My baby is almost 5 months old and approaching his neuter appointment.

I could also get a crate for him to stay in the first night because I assume that is what they would do there. I’m extremely nervous about him staying overnight because he gets so anxious at the vet that he freezes up and trembles when I have to set him down. I don’t want to be pushy with the vet about him coming home that same day because obviously she’s the professional but at the same time I feel like he’d be more comfortable at home and that I could make sure he didn’t do anything to injure himself.

So I have a bit of a dilemma, or I guess more so just a situation I’d like some advice on and help in working out some potential road bumps. My (22f) boyfriend (23m) of five years and I have been renting apartments together for about three and a half years. In that time we have managed to accumulate two wonderful cats, and similar to all of you, I love them so incredibly much. 
We currently live in a city where rent is extremely high, and honestly it can be kind of hard sometimes. I’d say we’re living just slightly above paycheck to paycheck. 

Anyways, my grandparents, who currently live on the farm they raised me on, have generously invited the four of us to come and stay with them and help them around the property for a few years while saving up money to potentially buy our own house. As I’m sure you can imagine if you’ve ever been poor, this sounds fucking awesome. My grandparents would not be charging us rent, just things like helping with groceries and electricity. 
However, I’m concerned for my cats. Firstly, my grandparents have an utterly massive Labrador named Jack. I’m talking 140 pounds. He’s nice, but cats are small, and even accidentally he could potentially kill them. He mainly stays downstairs, but I can’t guarantee always. Not to mention the onslaught of wildlife outdoors in the rural area that would make them into lunch. 
One of my cats, Pumpkin, is about 8 years old and would have no issue staying in what would become our bedroom (which is pretty large). But my younger girl, Mochi, can sometimes be a bit adventurous, and I honestly just feel completely petrified at the idea of her somehow getting out and coming face to face with Jack (who again, isn’t violent, just a unit), or God forbid getting outside. 

This would be a life changing opportunity, and if we could stick it out a year or two and save our incomes we could likely get together a down payment for a house. But nothing is really more important to me right now than my cats well-being. 

Could I make them happy living in that one room? Could I effectively keep them in there, safe? Does this seem ridiculous? 
I’m sorry this is so long, I’m just trying to really fill in the details. Does anyone have any advice? I’m feeling so conflicted. 

I have some ideas. Like making the closet into an area just for them, cat shelves, tall trees for them, baby gate at the door, self cleaning litter box to keep the small area clean… but would it be enough?

We’re now at a place where they coexist a majority of the time. She’s even starting to sleep near the male who is more tolerant of her. The other female wants nothing to do with her. It feels like she “burned a bridge” and now she won’t let her redeem herself. She growls when she gets too close or seems too interested in her. They won’t sniff each other or greet each other, even though they would in the past.  


Now at bedtime when we settle down, and in the morning just before we usually wake, the new cat will chase the female through the house until she’s trapped her under the nightstand.

I’m a new cat owner. I adopted a 3y old black male cat who weights around 12.5lbs and is fairly long about a month ago. The foster parent I got him from was feeding him two 3oz servings of fancy feast tuna and about 1 cup of kibble. 

I’ve kept up the portions but I’ve switched his wet food to the wellness brand. He had some loose stools on fancy feast so I figured it wasn’t the best option for him.

I feed him two 3oz wellness chicken herring meals—the first around 11am and the second around 7pm. I then have an auto feeder that feeds him a little less than 1/4 cup of kibble at 9am, 2:30pm, 9pm, and 12am. He seems like he is a healthy weight but I want to make sure that I’m neither over feeding him nor under feeding him. As a side note, he’s fairly active and plays with his toys twice a day for a good 10 minutes. He also uses his water fountain throughout the day.

Recently my cat has developed some behavioral changes that is concerning me. She is generally fine in the day, I play with her and she sleeps like normal. But at night shortly after I fall asleep she has started to lightly scratch me or scream in my face to wake me up. This will continue the entire night, I haven’t been able to sleep because of it. 

Some changes in our lives (that I don’t know is necessarily relevant): she has been sick for quite some time. She started coughing two years ago and every time I brought it up to the vet she dismissed it. The first time my partner brought her in, they finally did tests and found out she has a lung condition, as well as asthma. She has been on steroids for about a week now and she has stopped coughing. For me, I got Covid 3 months ago which triggered insulin resistance and my blood sugar stayed above 300 for a while (even when fasting). At that time both of my cats were attentive and I knew the reason why. Now my sugars are under control and things went back to normal. The only other thing is the fact that I’m on antibiotics because one of them scratched me and caused an abscess that I had drained the day this all started. (Again I don’t know if this is relevant but cats can sense a lot of things.)

Recently my wife and I had to move back in with family. We have 4 cats all ages 6-2. We thankfully had found someone to foster them long term until we were able to move back out, unfortunately today our foster told us that they no longer foster our cats so in now we're weighing our options. 

Now on to the main point, my thoughts were to build a cation type enclosure for our 4 cats in our families back yard (they don't want them in the house). All 4 of them have been indoor cats their whole lives and have almost no experience being outdoors. To keep them safe I felt like an enclosure with little individual houses/boxes would work. 

My wife's worry is that since it's starting to get colder as winter gets closer that they'll get too cold. 

Just hoping for some ideas or insight. It's not very likely that we'll be able to find another long term foster for them, even if they're split up.

Before picking her up, she was already spayed, vaccinated, litter trained, and is very well-socialized and outgoing. She’s amazing and everything I’ve ever dreamed of.

However, she demands my near-constant attention. It’s to the point where she cannot sleep unless I am next to her, and she will even wake up and follow me if I walk away from her while she’s sleeping. And she struggles to play independently, amongst other things. I spend several hours daily playing with her. I work from home, so I need to be able to get a few hours of work done. 

Is this separation anxiety? She was rescued from a parking lot when she was only a few days old, and was nursed to health for several weeks by veterinarians for a long time—so maybe she’s used to constantly being held and touched? 

Can anyone recommend any cat toys that she can play with independently? Any music/sounds I can play to relax her so she can sleep deeply alone? Any advice in general?

We do have a few problems tho. For starters we can't decide on what the best food for him is (both dry &amp; wet), we also don't know how often to feed him, at the moment we usually feed him whenever one of us first wakes up, then we either take food away and give it back to him after a couple of hours at a time or we leave it out for him all day and by the middle of the day he's eaten all of it and is hungry again. Another issue were having is training him to not bite/scratch us when we pet/play with him, it's getting a little too annoying/painful to even try to play with him ourselves because he sees our hands and feet as toys...which use to be cute, but now it just hurts. Another issue is that hubby has 2 pet birds that are always in their cage, but ever since we brought our fur baby home, he had tried to get to the birds at every opportunity, it was so bad that we ended up having to move the birds to the high ground so that he can't reach them. Another issue is that whenever we try to eat some food out in the open, he'll try his damnest to sniff, lick, and/or straight up walk on our food, which is cute, until you remember where his mouth has been so you don't want him anywhere near something that you are about to consume. Our current solution to this is locking him in the Landry room until we're done eating (we're not proud of this, but it's the only way that we can eat in peace). How do you guys have the patience with your cats after they’ve bittenand/or scratched you for the umpteenth time in a single day? And last but not least...is him being a hyperactive kitten. Now we're not TOO concerned about this because we know that he's a kitten and that he just wants to play, we usually just play with him for a few minutes to tire him out, then he becomes The lazy fuck that most cats are.

He almost exclusively tries to bite when he's on my mousepad and I put my hands near the mouse or near him, even to pet him. Obviously this makes it very hard to work, and nothing I've tried will make him stop. I'm trying to avoid anything physical or fear based, and all I've done when he bites so far is stopped petting him, walked away, told him no, or physically removed him from the desk. None of this has worked. I read that this may be pain or illness based, but I took him to the vet right before he started biting and he was very healthy. I also refuse to pet him when he sits near the mouse or keyboard and try to give him a lot of attention when he's elsewhere on the desk or on my lap.

He had no interest in other visitors previously or after just me alone and everyone said wow he chose you you must be his human your the only person he will play and sit with and we've had others visiting several times like you. So I was given him freely knowing I'd give him a good loving home like my previous cats who passed due to age. On adoption day it was asked if I could also take his sister since no one was really wanting her and to keep them as a pair but last minute another family said they wanted her so she was given to them instead    During initial meetings with  the litter his sister was the one I originally was interested in possibly adopting but showed absalutely no interest in me wouldn't even come near me which I didn't mind she in my eyes wasn't the cat for me as I always allowed pets to show if they're interested in me and my family members it was the way I was taught when getting dogs and used the same rule for my current kitten. 

I've now been asked today after the family member was kicked out of the place they were staying if I and my husband could also take my boys sister too permanently firstly by the owner then by the breeder family member. Originally I said no to his owner for various reasons but mostly because this person has a history of on and off again pet ownership when they decide it's too difficult or causing arguments where they live it's how we ended up with our beloved dog 

My boy is amazing but he's a handful and is slowly starting to calm down and be a cuddly cat and has always been loving, he's also starting to follow commands like no, get down off things he isn't supposed to be on with no punishment just redirection or picking him up off something he isn't allowed on. The family member his  breeder called tonight basically begging us to take his sibling as unbeknownst to me   they're also getting ready and in the process of rehoming the 4 other siblings from the same litter she kept them not realizing the costs of owning that many kittens along with the parents. Added the costs of neutering/spaying 4 kittens along with the parents prompted the rehoming kittens on the breeders part.

Here's my biggest issues the girl has not been spayed, no vaccines that we know of, the owner admitted the kitten is incredibly play aggressive and destructive tearing up the place where they lived resulting in arguments over the cat and one of the various reasons they got kicked out.  When we visited previously she litrelly hid and hissed at everyone several timss whereas my boy is social and happily comes to greet new comers to my house he's only hissed once and that was at his breeder *not sure why they still adore him* as it was the first thing I did was ask friends and family to visit and get the cat used to other people coming in his environment.

My husband also is torn while we have the room for another cat and she was originally was supposed to live here as a pair I don't know how my boy will react to his sister after being a single cat for 4 months. Can they still live together as siblings even after being apart this long?  I understand she will need to be spayed ASAP if she does but I'm also worried about the behavior she's displayed while being owned by a family member they do like animals and in no way to be nasty usually have a history of not being able to handle the needs of pets they've owned. My boys a bit scratchy but not destructive except with his own toys through play and occasionally the sofa but he does stop when he's told to use his tree 

I could afford it at a stretch but we'd have to use a low cost spay clinic due to the sudden addition as we planned financially for my current boy making sure we had everything covered vs with the potential sudden rehoming of his sibling with us. We did the same for our dog but didn't plan on potentially owning a second kitten this soon.

PS I want to say his litter was accidental and his parents have both since been neutered and spayed to prevent further litters

I’ve tried everything - uncovered box, partially covered box, fully covered box. All different types of litter. Scooping more often. Changing locations. He keeps peeing on the floor (but again, not every time)

He had a recent vet visit and they didn’t find anything wrong in that area. 

I got him fixed a few months ago, and hoped it would help. It hasn’t. 

My roommate and I lost our deposit at our last apartment over it.

My current apartment isn’t carpeted at all, which helps, because it’s much easier to clean, but it’s still a bad habit I want to break.

 He’s also very destructive. Loves breaking stuff, knocking stuff over, ripping stuff up. He’s still young, just over a year old but again I was hoping he would calm down some after neutering and with a little time, and he hasn’t.

My other cat is so chill that I think I got spoiled and this stuff gets to me sometimes.

He was listed as a stray but was definitely someone’s housecat - super calm, obviously well taken care of, etc. He’s a great cat, super quiet, and he did really well with her 2 year old at first.

Now that he’s settled in he’s developed a few weird behaviors. He will cry and cry and cry for food all day long like he’s been starved. He will occasionally try to attack when we’re preparing his food. He’s fed twice a day, mix of wet and dry, in relatively large amounts (slightly more than what’s recommended). We don’t free feed because he will eat until he throws up. It’s like he doesn’t know how to stop. The ONLY toy he will play with is one of those feeder balls with kibble in it. Because he gets food from it. 

He will also get weirdly aggressive for no reason. He’ll be completely chill one minute and with zero warning, bristle up and run at you and pounce with his claws out. He’s gotten my friend’s toddler a couple of times when she’s not even aware he’s there, much less taunting him or doing anything that would trigger an attack. It’ll just come out of nowhere. 

We play with him every day and he has plenty of toys, plus a 6 ft tall cat tree (that he has zero interest in). We’ve tried catnip, different varieties and types of toys, playing more, playing less, etc and nothing seems to be working.

I just adopted an 11 year old black tabby cat from a friend. From what I was told, she is an indoor cat and was having trouble getting along with other cats in the household. 

I've had cats in the past when I was a kid, but they were all outside cats. I live alone and have had no pets until this kitty came along.

I'm not working this week, so pretty much the routine is chill and watch some tv together, be on the computer while she walks around or chills in my lap or her raised bed next to me, play with toys/laser chase, eat treats, sleep in my bed with me when its night time.

I feel like she might really want to go outside. I have a fish pond and she likes to chill on the windowsill and watch them. I want to go out and do yard/pond work, but every time I go to the door, she comes, meows and waits for me to open the door so she can go outside. Maybe it's just because she knows there's fish out there? I'm not sure, but I've been staying inside with her because I feel bad. Her previous owner gave me a harness for outside but she absolutely hates it, she will NOT let me put it on her unless I really force it, which I don't want to do. One suggestion I've been given since she tends to follow me around a lot, (when she's not mad at me over the harness lol) was to just let her outside with nothing, but I'm nervous something could happen. 

Anyway, that's about it. I guess I'm mainly looking for advice or anything else I could do to make sure the cat is happy, engaged and comfortable, especially since it seems like she sleeps a lot...and on top of that, once I go back to work in a few days, she'll be alone for 8-10 hours each work day.

Now that it’s the other way around and he’s been a solo cat for 2 years, he’s not happy. This kitten is way more energetic than the owner described, and for the first 5 days he was tolerating it but now he’s isolating, barely eating, and super grumpy. We did not introduce them correctly now that we’re looking into it, so we’ve started to put him in my bf’s office (he always naps in there and can access the patio - he loves hanging out there) and he finally ate but its a process and he’s eating maybe once a day. He’s always started growling a bit and is pretty on edge. At night he still comes around for bedtime and tries to sleep with us but runs away if the kitten bugs him. Should we continue to keep them separate a majority of the time until he starts warming up? We feel so bad and I know these things take time but it hurts to see Mylo seem so unhappy with what we did.

Please be kind in the comments. Im in the consideration phase and haven’t made a decision.

My cat is over 10 years old. She’s been with me through many moves, and currently we full time RVing. Have been for some time.

Having her in my home has become extremely stressful and frustrating. I’d like to preface this by saying that she has been to a veterinarian and they informed me that she is in good health.

I’ve always had a problem with her incessant meowing. Meowing for food, meowing at the door to go outside, meowing for no reason at all. It’s not a cute meow. It’s a very loud yowling meow that is like nails on a chalkboard. 

She has a routine for eating once in the morning and once at night, the same as her dog sister. It’s plenty of food maybe even too much as she is slightly overweight. I recently switched back to dry kibble because she stopped eating wet food all together. Originally switched wet food because she stopped eating her Acana kibble. At first she was really enjoying it and then suddenly she just completely stopped eating it. When I started giving her lower quality dry kibble, she proceeded to eat again and we haven’t had issues. I’ve seen her not eat for 2 days before switching foods. 


She is outdoor/indoor, only because I feel awful about having her in a small space. She’ll go outside for about 30 minutes then come back to the door to meow and get in. She’ll even meow at the neighbors doors. Again this is not a cute meow. After letting her in she will be out the door after 15 minutes to go back outside. If I allowed it, she would do this all day.

I brush her every day, I play with her every day, but as soon as that’s done, she will go back to pacing around the house, alternating between meowing at her food bowl, meowing at the door, or just sitting in the middle of the room meowing for no reason.

She constantly tries to get on my chest when I’m laying down and even if I try to gently push her off, she will push back as hard as she can and I have to literally pick her up and put her down. As soon as she touches the ground she jumps back up. She doesn’t simply lay on my chest, she claws into my skin and is persistent about rubbing her nose and a half open mouth on me over and over. It’s really gross I hate it and it’s unhygienic. That’s all she wants to do when she’s trying to lay on my chest she has not interest in laying in my lap or anywhere else that’s easier for me. I’ve tried. More and more she has been keeping me up all night long doing this.

If I’m sitting at my computer, she will jump up and sit on my keyboard. I try to allow her to stay on my desk in front of me where she likes to be but after a while, my back starts to ache, and I have to put her down. Usually she will immediately jump back up again after I put her down to try and resume the position and again persistently push herself into that space while I try to remove her. It’s pretty aggressive.

I have to be careful about how often I let her out because she tends to go through garbage out there and eats it then comes inside to vomit all over the carpet. I also make sure she isn’t out at night because there are some rough stray cats out there at night.

I also have breast reduction surgery coming up soon and I know that she’s going to constantly be trying to get on my chest while I’m healing. And that’s going to be painful. 

I love her, but I can’t help but think that she isn’t getting what she needs here. I can’t even figure out what it is that she needs because I’m giving her everything that I possibly can.  

I’m at my wits end and at a point where I’m actually considering rehoming her so that she can live out the rest of her life somewhere where she can do all the things that she wants to do.  I wish I could explain how aggressive she is when it comes to all of this. It’s not cute, it’s not endearing. It’s over the top and difficult to deal with. It is driving me insane.

Anyway, any perspective or tips for potentially rehoming her would be appreciated. If she did find a place to live I would like to potentially have updates on how she is and potentially contribute to costs to make sure she’s comfortable and happy.",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,117036,public,self,Considering re-homing my 10+ yo cat - help,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/yskweh/considering_rehoming_my_10_yo_cat_help/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

However, I truly have nowhere to plug one in.

She's sweet and friendly and doesn't make trouble outside of clawing up paper towels, which is easily dealt with.

But because my roommate does not let her into his room overnight, every night for the last few nights (I moved in about two weeks ago) around 2-4am she has started meowing outside my door loid enpugh for me to hear through earplugs, and sticking her paw under the gap between the door and the floor. I know the typical solution is to ignore this until she realizes she won't be rewarded - however, in doing so she wakes up MY cat, who sleeps in my bed at night. I play with him before bed so he normally sleeps through the night, but she wakes him and then they spend anywhere from fifteen minutes to an hour batting playfully at each other under the door, after which my boy gets zoomies and keeps me up for another 15-20. So they both get rewarded for the bad behavior, and I get to listen to loud meowing and my door rattling until they settle.

The cats are friendly enough together, and around the same age (mine is 3yrs, his is 1yr) but they don't really play with each other yet, as my boy is still settling in and doesn't feel safe enough to play outside of my room yet.

My roommate is still new to cat ownership and doesn't play with her enough. I know the long term solution is to make him tire her out before bed or at least keep her in his room while he sleeps - but I don't want to sour things between us so soon by pestering him about his cat. But at this point this is affecting my quality of sleep, while he sleeps like a log and doesn't hear any of it even though he's right across the hall. I need a temporary solution until I can impress upon him the importance of engaging his cat.

I was thinking maybe a scat mat (NOT the electric kind, I'm not a monster) for in front of my door so at least, but if she learns to step over it, does anything exist that could keep them from pawing under the door?

I have four animals, doggies Blue (13) and Macie (11), and kitties Bristol (6) and Phoenix (3). 

In the past 3 days, Bristol will not stop attacking Phoenix. She acts like she's scared of him, which she's never done. And Phoenix is an orange boy with one braincell, he's the absolute sweetest. He doesn't instigate anything and is not aggressive at all but for whatever reason she won't leave him alone. 

She is not showing aggression to the dogs. When not around him, she doesn't seem like she's in pain or doesn't feel well. I've checked her over for any injuries. They've lived together since Phoenix was a baby. There have been no changes within the house, like routines or moving things around. Everything is normal.

What I think is weird is also in the past 3 days, my dog Blue has been trying to hump Phoenix and also will not leave him alone. (Playfully, no aggression.) Blue has never done this with any animal. He has never shown any... I guess sexual behaviors. 

The cats are both indoor cats. But I'm wondering if Phoenix has gotten into something that's made him smell different or something like that. He and Bristol have their tifts but it never last this long. And the fact that Blue is all over him too is weird. 

Any suggestions or advice would be great! I hate having to keep the kitties separated because that means one has to be by themselves in a room (due to floor plan in the house, there is no other way to separate them, and I hate this.)

I've been giving Bristol anxiety treats the past few days, and bought one of those wall plug-ins that are supposedly good for calming cats.

Recently my partner and I moved in together and both brought our respective pets to our new home together. Both cat and dog have never cohabited with the opposite species before.

Dog and cat have been living separately so to speak for the past 2 months with a pet gate separating them. The reason for the gate was firstly for their initial comfort but also my cat is on thyroid meds which I wouldnt want the dog to eat as kitty is a grazer. Secondly- lovely little dog, but does have the au de pupper and sheds like crazy so partner and I agreed he would be a downstairs dog.

My issue is that as kitty has gotten braver over the last two weeks, he is coming to the dog gate and literally boxing the dog through the bars, hissing, yowling, etc. Doggo gets excited and paws through the gate back at him, tail wagging, woofing in excitement.

I break them up as I dont want them to get hurt but is this a part of the adjustment process?

Last night the cat instigated his reign of terror 3 separate times and I caught him slinking back for a 4th before telling him off.

I dont expect them to be besties but am concerned if it continues to escalate in this manner that one or both will get hurt or stressed.

I absolutely adore cats, I think they are beautiful, intelligent and so so soft. Lately, I’ve been looking for a pet to keep me company in my apartment. Its not small, but it’s certainly not as big as a house. Unfortunately, I’ve never owned a cat before because I used to be extremely allergic to them, however over time and exposure, I’ve gradually decreased the severity of my allergy. However, watery eyes and a runny nose are still very much a thing. I also work long hours and travel pretty often. Now, I would be able to get a cat on planes, for long trips, but it would be harder to travel for say a weekend.

I’m looking for a cat that is particularly low maintenance. A breed that can take care of itself for a day or two with a self timed feeder and some toys. A not so energetic cat that won’t mind apartment living, but still doesn’t mind being pet, or watching movies on the couch together. I prefer short haired cats, but I really prefer hypoallergenic cats to save me from overdosing on Benadryl. 

I’ve done some research and Russian Blues seem to be the best bet. Is that correct? Are there other breeds? I love the Russian blue coat and eyes and from videos I’ve seen, I do love their temperament. They seem to be pretty self-reliant but curious and sociable. 

Am I right in this discernment, are there other cats you would recommend. Any tips or suggestions are welcomed.

I keep them on my nightstand so I can grab them when I leave for school in the morning. But ive noticed they've been ending up on the floor, in my bed, and in the hallway. I have a high feeling it's Lillian because she's the only one that really likes to ""hunt"", or grab and make off with things that interest her ig. but I don't know why she would be grabbing my squishes. I've looked them over, and I haven't seen any bite marks on them, and from the very few I have found are from where I assume she's been grabbing them, so I don't think she's been trying to eat them. 

A few days ago, I got curious and held one up to her. She sniffed it a little bit and licked it a few times, but just wanted me to pet her. 

so does anyone have any reason for this behavior? and if so, should I be worried about it? 

additional information if needed: 
- I have two cats, and she's the oldest at 13, and the other at ~8 is a lazy little thing
- I'm pretty certain she's a domestic long-hair, but can't be too sure 
- she's been spayed since around the moment we could get her fixed
- the only things she's really ""hunted"" have been a small bird decoration on my desk, and many straws.

Since she was a kitten she’s had problems with biting, and nothing seems to be able to stop the behaviour - not yelping, not walking away, not distracting her with toys, nothing. I believe that what would have prevented it is having a playmate who could bite back. She was never properly socialized, and I’m wondering if getting another cat could help change her behaviour. 

The problem is, she’s always been aggressive towards other cats any time she’s been around them. I worry that another cat would just cause long term stress if she’s already used to just being around myself and my roommates and not interacting with other cats.

My mom thinks since it's a smaller space I should one take one cat with me and leave the other one at home with them and she'll make sure to take good care of him. We have two cats, Finn (7m), and Evee (6f). My mom thinks I should just take Evee since she is more of my cat. Evee's favorite person is me and is not really interested in anyone else is our family. She hangs out in my bedroom most of the time and loves to sleep in my bed with me. She often follows me around the house or gets me to follow her. She licks me and just generally wants to be near me most of the time. She is scared of people she doesn't know and sometimes hides from Finn. Finn is super territorial and loud and rude. He's like a jerk in cat form. He has sprayed every couch in the house to claim it as his, despite being neutered. (My mom is concerned that if I take him with me too, he's going to do that again.) He likes to scream, a lot, and he can go for hours without taking a break. (My mom is also concerned he will bother roommates.) He likes to attack Evee, just like randomly or if he's hungry or bored. (She's kind of scared of him and hides from him at times and they just don't coexist in the same room for long periods of time well. Evee stays in my room and Finn is usually downstairs.) Also Finn claims all the cat toys and cat trees. We have 2 cat trees and essentially Finn is only one who uses them because he has decided they are his and Evee can't use them. Sometimes she'll go in the bottom cubby of one of the trees because Finn never goes in there because he's too big. Evee won't really play with toys if Finn is around because he takes them. She only plays in my room. 

BUT I feel like no one in my family really spends time with Finn like I do. He has long hair and needs to be brushed everyday so it doesn't get matted. I'm the one who feeds hims and brushes him and plays with him. No one else does. I want to bring him with me because I love him and I don't know if he'll get the attention he needs at home with my parents. He will miss me and Evee. (I don't think Evee will miss him though).

My wife and I rent a room in a shared house. When we moved in about two years ago, our landlady was looking for a new cat, and we went with her to pick out Ghost, just a baby kitten at the time. He has always been unofficially ""our cat"" - he is very attached to us, and doesn't want anything to do with our roommates/landlady. He would spend all day cuddling if he could and gets very upset when we leave for work. There is another cat, Grim, who is a bit older and is definitely my landlady's cat. Ghost and Grim get along decently, they play and once in a while nap together. Both cats officially belong to my landlady but they have made their preferences clear. Both cats are indoor cats.

My wife and I are about to move into quite a small apartment. It's a much smaller space and we both work full time out of the home. I want to ask my landlady if we can take Ghost with us. It breaks my heart to think of him looking for us and I love him so much. I really worry how he would be without us because he is so attached. He was separated from his mother very young and still tries to suckle with us.

I came to Guatemala and plan to be here for 2 months so I can spend the holidays with her and her family. The plan was to go back to LA together along with her dogs. Naturally we both wanted my cat to get along with her two 2-year old maltese mixes so I brought him along, but now that they’ve met and after my Scottish fold was being aggressivley barked at he just seems paranoid. It looked like a classic playground bullying scenario. Now he isnt doing all the things he normally does like eat, drink, play, use the restroom you name it. All he does is hide all day. 

Back at home we have a Pomeranian in the same household and they have no issues. It seems like he has a lot on his mind and I do understand that all this was a lot to take in for him, the new environment, people, animals. Coming into this I completely understood how it was going to be stressful for him but didn’t expect myself to be this worried. 

The dogs seem like they have social issues themselves as well. I’m not dog expert but looks like they run the house. They rarely respond when being called, bark at almost everything (even the maid who lives in the house), follow her everywhere (even into the bathroom), they only let my fiancé and her brother touch them. Yes, it could be a natural instinct for them to feel as if they need to protect her. 

So now I’m wondering, will it get better if I wait it out and let them be? Do I just let my cat hide? is my cat broken?

When I first got the kitten for him it was fine. Had a sensitivity to a certain brand and went through couple weeks of having diarrhoea at 12 weeks. Was fine after we figured out what the issue was and was peeing and pooping normally in the litter tray until he turned 6 months old. 
My brother is very stressed out at the moment and hoping someone has an answer out there. The cat started off pooping outside the litter box frequently he didn’t completely abandon the box but he would feel comfortable pooping in that one spot like the bathroom. Used enzyme cleaner and everything but still he kept going there then we took the bathroom mat away and he stopped for a couple weeks then went back there even when there was no bathroom mat and began pooping there. This went on for a couple months, vet said he was fine and that it was behavioural. We then found out he had been pooping under the bed. Then he started peeing on the bathroom floor. We put a litter box in the bathroom but still he peed outside the box. So at this point he’s started pooping back in his box and peeing on the bathroom floor. We figured he needed to be neutered but we was also aware that it was a habit by now so we needed to break the habit. He got neutered and we confined him to a room with his litter box, showed him how to use it. We even put two litter boxes one for pee one for poop ( if that’s what the issue was) STILL he pees right outside the box but poops inside the box. So after maybe a month of re training him we let him out and he went and peed in 3 different spots. The litter is soft like sand but it can’t be the litter because he is using it for pooping. The vet said he is healthy but my brother will get a blood test done last resort. Let’s just say the blood test comes back fine? What then? What could this possibly be? What is wrong with him? We have tried calming diffusers, more than one litter box, open litter box, soft litter, litter training, enzyme cleaner each time, big enough litter box. Boxes are scooped daily. Tried different litter.  He gets 1/2 hours of playtime a day and everything he could possibly need as an indoor cat. He is the only cat. Surely it cannot be marking behaviour? He got neutered about 2 months ago. If it was a problem with his bladder then why would he start with pooping inappropriately first then peeing? We have also tried litter attract but it’s like he’s not abandoning his box he’s just peeing in other places but more and more frequently. Is there such a thing as cats having an overreactive bladder? So I don’t know if things like a urinalysis will be of any help. Nothing is working. My brother just keeps spending money on things for the cat to help him or replacing things that the cat has ruined. PLEASE HELP. He was fine until about 6 months ago when it all started and nothing drastically changed for his behaviour to change.

I have a super anxious cat. To the point that nothing I did worked. There was been a few post about it here. Long story short she was put on a very low dose of prozac. Two weeks after she is back to herself. 

I am hoping that maybe she can be in it for a year and I can slowly take her off of it. 

While she is doing better I do notice that she will be sleeping and if my fiance starts doing dishes she will get up immediately and make sure it is safe before going back to bed. None of my other 3 cats do this. I do notice that playing music or having some type of noise helps ""masks"" other sounds and she can sleep. This can be very simple sounds, doors opening, etc. And they can be happening far away from the room she is in, and she will still get a bit panicked.

Other than playing more with her (which I have been doing), what else can I do to help her ease her anxiety?

Any tips are highly appreciated 🙏🏻.

I have two lovely cats :) They’ve been with me since the start of the pandemic and so they have only ever known home-life with me. That’s the norm for them - wake up, wake me up, play, eat, and enjoy :)

The problem is that I have to return to work in person next year. I am dreading and feeling anxious about how they will adjust because they’ve been with me for about 2yrs 24/7 together basically all the time. I go out and they have been alone but not long. I realize that I’ve spoiled them and worried about how they will adjust.

My question is, would it be better to have the two of them left home alone for the 9hr work day, and play with them plenty once I am home? Or should I bring them to my parents’ daily so that they have a larger place to roam around and some human interaction? They’re still skittish of my parents and I have brought them over 1-2x a week for the past several weeks to get used to it. They’ll follow me around wherever I go at my parents’ home but they’ll have a bit of fun exploring and climbing and jumping. At our own home, it’s tinier, and they’re content and happy to lounge in their cat tree.

Would it be better to have them be in the comfort of their own home, without company, for 9hrs/5x week? Or would it be better to bring them to my parents’ where they can explore, have human company, but are skittish?

When I observed him and later met him in the common cat room, The Buddy ignored the other cats in the room in favor of me, and later, my husband. He adores humans, and anyone who enters our house is immediately greeted by The Buddy, who's never met a lap he didn't like. My husband and I don't get to travel together a lot, but the few times we have since adopting The Buddy, we had friends and neighbors look in on him three or four times a day, and we're told he was very starved for attention. He showed a little separation anxiety when we returned from a recent (short) trip to see my 81-year-old mom, and I wonder if he might like a friend when we (especially I) can't be around all day like we usually are (we both mostly work from home). 

I've found a 4-month-old female who loves cats more than she loves humans, and she's unbonded. The foster thinks she sounds like a good match for our cat, especially since she won't compete for our attention and she's a beta, so I'd been thinking we'd foster to adopt (I met her and she's so, so sweet). Per advice we read, I brought home a piece of her bedding; the Buddy sniffed it for a long time in a crouched position, then ran upstairs and starting patrolling the house. In doing some reading it sounds like the fact that he didn't hiss or avoid the smell is at least not a negative sign, but I'm super stressed about the introductions (I use Jackson Galaxy as my guide, so we're going with the separate-room plan) and the tension I saw in his body language.

She's about four years old. She's a tiny cat, is very friendly, but can be a bit timid. She used to live with an elderly (18 yr old) male cat and got along quite well with him before he passed. Back in June, we opted to adopt a second cat and brought home our new addition, Mochi. Mochi is a two year old female, who is extremely outgoing and friendly with people. She is also significantly larger than Luna. We did slow introductions for months, with each introduction stage successful, until they are unsupervised. When given the chance, Mochi stalks and charges at Luna, which ultimately terrifies her. Luna is not typically the aggressor, but will hiss whenever she notices signs of Mochi's incoming aggression. In thinking about it, it's really difficult for us to know if Mochi is instigating play, or actually aims to hurt Luna. Either way, Luna interprets all of her advances as a threat. It has been about 6 months since our initial adoption, and we have not been able to curb the stalking behavior. I have personally always owned cats, but have only introduced kittens to adult cats, and have not ever attempted to introduce two adult cats.

I have two babies, brother and sister, both neutered, age 7 years, they get along really well and love each other so much.

I am moving from Italy to the UK with my boyfriend and it's going to involve a long car trip. I've read loads about the best way to car travel with cats, but we are still uncertain about some details and what would be best for them. To be honest, I am really anxious because I want them to be as fine as possible.

To give a bit of background... They already moved twice, but each time it was just an hour drive. The first time was when I moved at my boyfriend's, then we stayed there for about a year; after that, the cats and I moved back with my mum but in a new house, and now after six months, we are going to join my boyfriend in the UK. They don't like moving, but the second move was better than the first one, they got used to the new place way faster. Instead, the second drive was a bit worse: they meowed all the time and Grey pissed himself. Between this two moves, we had to get them to a special vet for their passport, each drive back and forth was 30 mins, and going there Grey pissed and shit himself. The vet carrier is different than the ""move"" carrier, just to be clear. So, yes, Grey is the one that gets more stressed.

We found what we think would work best for them: staying in a carrier together (when they are together they are way more relaxed, even during a car travel), but they will have enough room to stay away from each other if they want to; I will sit in the back with them as we found that helps too; there is some cat music they particulary enjoy; we will use feliway too; and the vet prescribed us a relaxant. I am harness training them, and Grey is at a really good point, so maybe we will have also that option - I know some cats prefer to travel with the harness and leash on without being in the carrier, but I am not sure we will get to that point.

Our real dilemma - the reason of this post - is how to structure the drive itself. It is a 17 hr drive, with normal traffic and without considering pauses, so let's say 20. We are okay doing it in one go, and initially we thought it was maybe best for them - as they don't like new places generally - but now I am wondering if it wouldn't be better to stop for the night somewhere and do two shorter drives. I am afraid that in one go, they wouldn't use the litter and I don't want them to get an UTI.   
Grey just had struvite and calcium oxalate crystals one month ago, probably due to stress; he is totally fine now, he is taking a med (STIEN in Italy) to prevent it and they are also both eating the urinary care food. She had an UTI 2 years ago, non stress related. But you can see why I worry about this.  
At the same time, I am not even sure they would use the litter during the night stop, but maybe it's more likely?",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,116882,public,self,Long car journey,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/yrk4vx/long_car_journey/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

Now it's come back with a vengeance.

My wife and I went on a trip for ten days. Luckily my mom lives close enough that she was able to watch my cat while we were gone. During the trip he started peeing and pooping out of his box, mostly on the living room floor. We assumed it was anxiety, but had him checked out with the vet when we returned just in case it was something else. The results came back normal.

This was a month and a half ago. Pretty much everyday we find a pee spot in the living room and it's starting to stain the hardwood. His litter box is being cleaned at least once a day, so we know it's not in reaction to a messy box. We've been spraying pheromones. There's been no major household or dietary changes for him.

Today he did the unthinkable and did it on the couch. My wife works for Twitter (still) and last week I suffered a minor stroke (I'm only 36 and in relatively good health) so needless to say since we've been back from our trip, we've been extremely stressed out.

Even then he was never super snuggly, preferring to play and explore more than anything else. If course, if he was tired, he might sleep in your arms. But he didn't actively seek affection.

At about a year he started becoming affectionate. He would rub against your legs or hand, flop down and roll over to ask for belly rubs and you got to hear him purr a couple times a day anyway. He still wasn't like that all the time but you got enough of it. We used to pick him up all the time and while he didn't want to be held too long, he seemed content with it. Every once in a while he would purr a little while held, maybe knead on our arm a bit. I was happy with that.

But now, getting closer to two years, he's going back to preferring to be alone it seems. If he sees you, he'll raise his tail and you can pet his head a couple times and he clearly likes it. But no purrs, no flopping. If you pick him up, he goes stiff and will generally give a meow in protest within seconds. He seems FAR more prone right now to getting upset to the point of attacking. The only real times he seeks out affection now are when we go to the bathroom (he NEEDS to come in and he'll be all love-y for about 30 seconds) or when we go to bed he will come up between us, flop down and purr and be 100% affection. If we didn't have that, I'd be much more upset.

We did get a new kitten about a month ago which I could see contributing to his general curmudgeon-ness but his behavior started before that.

I'm not sure if there are any steps I can be taking to try to convince my Freddy to be a little more affectionate. If this is simply who he is then I can accept that - we'll love him all the same.

I live in Estonia so there isn't usually a massive selection of different cat foods at more stores (for a reasonable price). My cat can be quite picky with most foods, flavors, even wet she will only eat the liquid etc. The one food she has seemed to enjoy for the last couple of years is Purina One Bifensis (beef flavour), but I recently came across a more natural/heathier looking brand for not much more money. I don't know much about grain free or cat nutrition but this new one seems better to me. I just wanted to know if it was worth the extra cost (only 15-20%).

Purina One:

**Ingredients:**  
Beef (16%), dried poultry protein, wheat (14%), soya meal, maize, maize gluten meal, animal fat, wheat gluten meal, dried beet pulp, dried chicory root, minerals, digest (with added heat treated Lactobacillus Delbrueckii and Fermentum powder 0.025%), yeast.

PrimaCat:

Ingredients:

Fresh salmon 26%, dehydrated chicken 26%, pea, potato, dehydrated turkey 12%, chicken fat, dried apples, salmon oil, brewer’s yeast, chicken liver, prebiotics MOS &amp; FOS (200 mg/kg), superfoods blend 500 mg/kg (sea buckthorn, cranberry, catnip, rosemary, algae).

He is very sweet, cuddly, and energetic! I am having so many mixed feelings about him though. **TLDR at the bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

To start, the kitten has done nothing wrong. But some issues have come up. I'll try to keep this as short as I can.

1.  I have a 15 year old blind dog, and although the kitten seems to like him and is actually trying to rub against him, my dog is not liking it. Bubba has a very sweet temperament and does not have an aggressive bone in his body.  But he has severe separation anxiety, and I was hoping that another animal in the house would help, but it has actually made it worse. I though Bubba was scared at first, but it seems like he genuinely does not like the kitten. Him being blind also means that he can't see the kitten and his body language. We've had many instances with the kitten wanting to play with bubba, or even getting aggressive with bubba because he isn't paying attention to him. I can tell that bubba is getting increasingly stressed and is not liking our situation at all. I've had him since he was a puppy, and I know him well enough to say that him warming up to the kitten would take more than time. I honestly think that Bubba might be jealous or something...
2. Time is also another issue. I already knew that kitten would have a lot of energy, so I tried to prepare to be available to play with him for around four or five 15-30 minute increments throughout the day. But even after we are done playing, he seems to keep bouncing off the walls. During these times he also is attacking bubba out of excitement. He is so cute, and I enjoy playing with him sometimes, but most of the time it feels like a chore. As time goes on it is becoming harder and harder for me to enjoy playing with him and giving him attention... I feel so terrible saying that when he is so sweet and he can't help his energy level! 
3. I've noticed patchy rashes on my legs that appears to be contact dermatitis. I am very prone to skin allergies, so I take a morning and a night allergy medication and I have learned what causes my allergies so I only use skin products that I know I'm not allergic to. I noticed these rashes a couple days after getting the kitten, and I can't say for certain but I think I might be allergic to him... I haven't changed anything in my routine except for him. I'm really sad just thinking about the possibility that I am allergic.
4. This isn't fair to the kitten, and I don't really know why I'm adding this, but I have a lot of plants that I care about and I am so scared that he is either going to get sick from them or he is going to kill them. I am currently in the process of segregating most of them to one room and hanging the rest up high. But from what my friends have told me about cats, its that they will find a way to get up there if they are motivated enough. He has already managed to get on top of my fridge! I really can't give away or sell most of my plants since they are family heirlooms...

**TLDR: Overall the biggest reasons I am on the fence is because my blind senior dog seems to be really stressed and shows no signs of warming up, and I am developing skin rashes possibly because I am allergic to the kitten. I know that people say that time will tell, but I don't want to make the kitten grow more attached to us and have him suffer by taking him back to the shelter. But after doing a lot of research I am also worried about the kitten not finding a good home to adopt him. I just really don't know what to do. I keep thinking that our lives would be back to normal and be easy and calm again. But I feel so guilty for thinking that way. I want to believe that he would find a good home since he is so sweet and cuddly, but I have no way to know...**

&amp;#x200B;

*I am going to try to go to the doctor soon to try and see if I'm allergic to cats or maybe something else (liter maybe?). And if I'm not, and I decided to take the kitten back to the rescue, would it be stupid of me to try to adopt an older cat instead? I thought that a kitten would better adapt to our home, but now I'm thinking that maybe Bubba would warm up to an adult cat more? I don't know though.

Can I hear some success stories from someone about a single kitty who outgrew the biting kitten phase and is doing just fine?

This is about my other two cats - Asuka (female, 4, spayed, tuxedo) and Gawain (male, 4, neutered, white). Asuka has always had anxiety issues but they've skyrocketed since we adopted Gawain, to the point where she's sequestered herself to the second floor of our apartment and we've had to start feeding her separately because she won't come down even for food. 

Gawain was found on the streets with a number of injuries, sad and hurting, and immediately attached himself to us. We helped him recover. He has never been anything but sweet to Asuka; when she hisses at him he sits down and slow blinks at her. He tries to play with her occasionally, which she hates. If he dares to come anywhere near her she hisses, swats, scratches; when we're out of the house and can't separate them sometimes we'll come home to find he has a new scratch on his ear or nose.

Asuka was our first cat together; we've had her for almost her whole life. Feliway doesn't help. We've been considering taking her to the vet for possible anxiety medication because her anxiety levels around Gawain are just not rational. And she's hurting him, and that's hardly fair to him.

This has turned into a ramble - basically, I love both of these cats and they are both incredibly attached to us. Rehoming either is not an option. But the current situation is not fair to either of them and I'm not sure how to proceed outside of the aforementioned anxiety meds thing.

Yesterday I noticed him crouching strangely, but thought nothing of it, and today I got home to little drops of pee all around the room, with his litter box full of scattered little pees. I put him in the bathroom temporarily to clean up, and he was still leaking on the bathroom floor, as though he was incontinent, but he’s still a baby :(

He’s eating and drinking and behaving normally, it just looks like he can’t hold it in, and like he constantly needs to go, like maybe a UTI? 

I’ve had some trouble with introducing the two cats these past 2 months as well, as he seems more dominant than my older cat and likes to swat at her when I have them interact. He also doesn’t like being stuck in the room even though I let him explore the house everyday, he scratches at the door and I know not to give him attention when he does that, I don’t know when he’ll get the message that it doesn’t work, I just hope I’m doing things correctly :’)

He loves cuddles, specifically when he's got his two front arms wrapped around my neck like a hug and I hold him in my arms, he also gives kisses. At first I thought maybe it was the smell of food on my mouth because that's where he likes to lick, basically only my lips unless he can't get to them then he licks my face. As he's gotten older he's gotten more intense about it, trying to force me into it. He's started rubbing his lower area against me until he well.. releases, so I've had to start removing him from me when he starts to grab tighter but he'll bite my neck and won't let go. I know this behavior is because of puberty but he doesn't do it to anyone else except for recently we found a 2-3 month old female kitten on the streets and he's been treating her in a similar way. I just want to know if it's solely because he's going through puberty and this is what all unneutered male cats do to female humans when not around fertile female cats, if he has some weird unnatural attraction to me, or if it has nothing to do with attraction and it's because he's just used to cuddles and now associates cuddles with pleasure.",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,116816,public,self,Is my male cat attracted to me?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/yqzj0e/is_my_male_cat_attracted_to_me/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

Just to lay out her situation: We took her to a vet within 30 minutes of receiving her, the vet wiped her once and she let out so much that the vet was shocked, but said it seems she's starting to get it all out and she should be okay, but to come back if she has any stomach issues. She also received a dewormer.

She's been bottle fed the last 3 days (tomorrow is scheduled to be her first day on wet food + KMR formula mixed according to the vet) 

Her sleep situation is we have a walk in closet separate from any of our other animals, we have her in a box in there with a puppy pad and a fluffy blanket, so the ambient temperature is higher than the main house and she can stay warm.

Questions:

1) Her butt has been pretty red since that initial wiping at the vet (and following huge expel) - is this okay? It seems _less_ inflamed but I'm worried Im just inflaming it more when I wipe her.

2) For wiping her so she can go to the restroom, how long should we wipe? We've been trying to use baby wipes, are these okay? I bought cat wipes but they say ""not for internal use"" which worried me about wiping her with them.

I don't wanna wipe too long and inflame her even longer, but I also don't want her stuffed up cause I didn't do it right.

Our vet instructed us to do it once per meal, and so far she pees after every meal but doesn't poop most the time 
(maybe 1-2 times a day? sometimes in her box, even though she didnt go during a feeding, which requires cleaning everything out and remaking it)

3) When she cries for food, we feed her, and she'll usually drinks a lot which is good, but then she stops. 

She then starts sitting there crying, but if we give her the bottle back she maybe suckles a tiny bit then spits it out again. 

Holding her doesnt seem to help, and neither does letting her walk around a bit seemingly, if we put her back in her box and in the warm closet she'll cry MUCH louder and climb towards us until we close the door and let her cry herself out - she then falls asleep.

Is anything wrong with that? I can't find info on kittens in this age group crying beyond ""They cry for food"" but she doesn't want the food, so I'm just not sure what else to do but get her to sleep?

4) Is there anything stimulating we should be doing for her? 

Right now the process has been:
Wait until 3-4 hours has passed since last feeding, or she cries -&gt; Feed her until she stops accepting the bottle -&gt; try and let her walk around or climb on us a bit to work on her muscles and coordination -&gt; put her back in her box in the closet and let her sleep till next feeding or she cries again

Is there anyway we should be playing with her? or stimulating her? I want her to learn how to walk and play when she's supposed to, and she seems interested in walking around, but she's also uncoordinated and falls over a lot, and shakes when she holds herself up too long.

5) Her back legs/tail are kinda grimy, they feels wet most the time and have that sorta ""stiff"" feeling.

I took a washcloth and some unscented dawn to it and its a tiny bit better, but not ideal, is there anything better I could be doing?

I have two female cats (both neutered) one of 14 years old another of 7months old (not related). They get along really well and my older cat even enjoys playing a bit more since they have been introduced. 
Soon I will adopt a 3rd cat (kitten) from a friend's litter. However I am not sure what the best addition could be another (neutered) female or a male? 

I am inclined to go for a female because they are usually calmer I've noticed from experience and don't stray to far away from our garden. However another person told me too many females together will not work (I don't know if 3 is considered too many)

I have a 1 yo female cat named Peanut and my bf has a 5 yo female cat named Martini. BF and Martini moved into my house a little over 2 months ago and our cats are still not getting along.

We kept Martini in a bedroom by herself when she first came over and still do bc of the issues we’re having. We did the Jackson Galaxy method of introduction. 

We’ve gotten to a point where both cats can be in the same room together and things mostly go well. They can both sit on the couch in peace. They were even face to face the other day (although that ended with Martini hissing, but I believe she is scared of Peanut). We give them treats and play with Peanut (Martini is not very interested in toys). 

Here’s our issue - anytime Martini gets off of the couch and starts walking around/goes outside the bedroom to explore, Peanut stares her down and chases her. Martini runs to hide under another couch and will hiss and growl at Peanut. There has been swatting/hissing on both sides but so far no major fighting with fur flying/blood. 

I try to use treats or toys to distract Peanut when I see her staring Martini down but 9/10 times it doesn’t last long and she ends up chasing. We have tried calming treats and spray - that didn’t work. Currently trying a calming collar on Peanut but so far I haven’t seen a huge difference. 

We’re both at our wits end. It seems like Peanut is being aggressive and chases her down to attack her. It’s like she’s saying to Martini “Hey why are you going out there? That’s my territory.” We feel bad for Martini having to mostly be confined to this bedroom when she clearly wants to go out and explore, but we are too afraid of them fighting for real. We don’t know how much, if any, interactions either cat had with other cats before. One of my thoughts is maybe Peanut was never taught how to properly interact with other cats. 

Are we overreacting? Is this just normal behavior? Do we need to restart the intro process? Both cats have been to the vet in recent months and are fine. We don’t know what else to try. I just want Peanut to understand that Martini is not a threat but nothing we’re doing is stopping the chasing.",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,116803,public,self,Cats not getting along,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/yqqu7l/cats_not_getting_along/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

Some backstory: About six months ago, 5 kittens turned up in our backyard (2 boys, 3 girls). We successfully TNR’d all 5 babies, and have been feeding them twice daily ever since. The 2 boys and 1 of the girls have been extremely affectionate and accepting of human interaction since day one. 
About a month ago, one of the boys went missing and hasn’t returned. We think he was able to find a family that took him in with them and now he’s living the good life indoors. 
With one cat down, we began becoming very attached to these cats, the most being with the runt of the pack, one of the girls. The other boy was just as affectionate - they would come into our sun room every night for pets and snuggles. While they should be technically deemed feral cats, they never struck us as such, because they were so accepting of human touch and would come up to us with no hesitation. 
Our favorite, the runt girl, all of a sudden turned up with a scrape on her nose. This sent us into a tizzy and, in order to prevent her nose getting any worse, she was moved indoors with us. She’s now been to the vet, her nose is fully healed, and she’s a new member of our family. 
Since she has come inside to live with us, the remaining boy has begun yowling outdoors at night. He has scaled our house to get to our bedroom windowsill, and hangs from the screens on our window on our sunroom, all while meowing very loudly. It’s very distressing for both our cat and us. We thought perhaps they just missed each other, so we let him back into our sunroom so they could be together, but they didn’t show any interest in being together. It seems that he just wants to be inside with us as well - I’m not sure if the yowling is territorial or jealous.

My question is - do you think it would be okay at this point to try and adopt the boy out? Or would it cause more harm than good? I think he is destined for the indoor life and would be great at it. At this time we are not able to accommodate them both living inside with us. Or is there a different solution we should consider? Would no longer feeding them encourage to move on from our yard?

So as I mentioned, she's at the age where she's super into everything and still has that kitten energy. She'll get zoomies and run around the house, meowing like crazy, which is a good sign she needs to be played with. I work from home so I try to play with her fairly consistently, 2 times a day about 30-45 minutes per session with food immediately after. Lately though, I found she's been pretty uninterested with her wand and prefers a laser pointer.

I bought a retractable wand off Amazon and it came with a ton of attachments. I've also just buy her new ones whenever I see them so needless to say we have a ton to work with. I have feathers, worms, mice, and even a bee. And for a little bit, she'll love it. She'll stalk it, chase it, I let her catch it; usual stuff. But after maybe after 2-3 play sessions she'll just have no interest in it whatsoever. She'll just casually walk away and play with something else while I'm standing here, trying my hardest to convince her this is prey.

We also bought her a laser pointer toy, which both me and my girlfriend were a little skeptical at first. We've both heard it messes with cat's heads since they physically can't catch a dot so it might be frustrating for them. Originally I bought it as a tool, rather than a toy. Jackson Galaxy mentioned that it's good to ""wind-up"" cats to play with physical toys, which is what I'd try to do. I'd also use it as a redirection toy, something to take away her attention from something I don't want her to play with. But after being fed up with her not playing with the wand, I whipped out the laser pointer and got her to play for a solid session. She looked satisfied, was panting and purring, and like I said it was the most consistently engaged I've seen her play in a while. The thing is I'm still on the fence on whether or not I should continue to use the laser over wand. To put it bluntly I feel like I'm giving her the kitten playtime equivalent to crack, just feels extreme and I don't want her sense of play to be warped because of it.

My question is what alternatives to the wand that are still remote (cat on one end, me on the other) would you recommend? I think the message Friday's sending to me is that she's bored of the wand, but I know if supplementing it with kitty crack (laser pointer) is the right way to go.",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,116792,public,self,Kitten prefers laser pointer over wand,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/yqkfvi/kitten_prefers_laser_pointer_over_wand/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

For context, she is a healthy, 2 year old orange tabby. Back in February, she started pooping outside of the litter box, mostly on rugs. I took her to the vet and they didn’t find any issues, said it was behavioral. It lasted for a few months and was quite frustrating because I didn’t know why she started doing this. I changed her food, moved the litter box, got a bigger litter box, etc.. all the things I researched that could solve the issue, I tried. Nothing seemed to work. I took her to the vet again and they did a deeper analysis; still nothing was wrong with her. I ended up having to get rid of all the rugs in my apartment and switched to a cat-attracting litter, and that seemed to work. She now goes in the litter box consistently, yay! 

However, she is still having an issue with scooting. After she goes in the litter box, she will wipe her butt on my blankets/couch/floor.. mostly in soft spots (blankets on my bed 😞). She never used to do this before she started having the litter box issues. It really seems like she just doesn’t want to clean her butt herself anymore.

I live on the ground floor of an apartment building, I don't have a garden but do have a small patio. Remi appeared as a stray on my patio last June asking for food. Over the days she kept coming back and it'd became apparent she'd adopted me and my partner. We quickly learnt that the neighbours next door had abandoned her after their dog tried to attack the cat, they also mistreated her and made no effort to get Remi to return. We slowly adjusted her to our apartment and initially she'd spend a few hours inside and the rest of the day outside (sadly though we live near a busy street that's filled with rats, so it already wasn't the safest).

We adjusted her to indoor life by slowly trusting her alone, and giving her lots of attention and letting her sleep during the day. Then we would keep her inside during work hours because it tends to get rainy in autumn. What made me realise she should be kept indoors fully though was aside from the fact we realised the places she'd go to were kind of filthy, we also caught her a few times nearly crawling inside the open window of those awful neighbours who almost got her killed (this became especially common the last week or so).

The first time we tried to keep her inside at night was in July, but she kept meowing/crying which made us relent and let her go outside. But last night was the first night she stayed inside 24 hours, and although she did meow a few times, she would usually after 5 minutes just move on and relax as if she didn't care anymore. I did stuff like play with her, allow her to climb and roam the apartment, as well as putting livestreams of birds and mice on the TV to help stimulate her. And I was able to sleep the whole night without any disturbance from her.

We picked a cat of the opposite sex in hopes this would recude intial hostility. 
We are following ""introducing a new kitten"" protocols: Oliver has its own room for now where he sleeps and spends parts of the day. He's been here less than a week and I know it takes time, especially with a cat that has established routines and a certain character like Sophie - she is very quiet, likes to nap, while Oliver at 3 months old is a savage.
I would say it's not even going bad: when we are home and can supervise them, Sophie is always overseeing what he does as he plays and randomly runs around, the hissing and the growling on her part are tuning down as well and she is starting to relax a little (aka going back to sleep, sort of) if he doesn't get too close.
I'd like to add that this is what the vet told us to do - after the first 3-4 days where Oliver has stayed mostly in his room, where all of his needs are met of course, to let them interact and just let it sort itself out.

The doubt I have and the reason for me to ask for advice is this: whenever Oliver decides it's time to force socialization, he'll try to play with Sophie by hiding and doing little ambushes and following her around; Sophie responds to this by hissing and trotting away, pissed; she swatted at him only a couple times, no claws involved. Considering how she reacts, would you say this'll fix itself over time or do we need to change strategy? Most of all, is this too stressful for Sophie? The moment he's gone to his room she is back to being our laid back vocal Sophie.

Last summer when it was warm one night I had the door open, and a kitten came into my house.  I didn't know whose it was but it looked healthy, so I gave it a little tuna and let it stay with me for awhile.  It left in the early am, a few weeks went by and then I saw it in my neighbor's window.  The window was closed but soon after they started leaving it open in the day so the cat could go outside.

After awhile he started popping up again occasionally at my place when I left my door open, usually just to say hi and walk around a bit.  Sometimes I give him treats, he isn't overweight and he's quite vocal when he wants one.  But I also noticed sometimes he'd be meowing outside my next door neighbor's door (not the cat owner) looking to get invited in by them as well.  Since I often leave my own door open for air flow, when I hear him meowing even if my door is shut I'll open it and see if he wants to come in.  He usually hangs out for awhile checking out the corners and nooks then leaves.

Lately he's been doing it a lot more often.  Last night it was pouring rain and barely above freezing.  I normally never see him in the evenings, I assumed he went home to his family and a warm bed.  But it was very late (after midnight) and he was meowing so miserably so I let him in to get warm.  He pretty much instantly jumped on my couch and nestled between my legs on top of my blanket, where he stayed until morning.  I left the door open for him even though it was cold, and he left just before dawn.

The next day I asked a different neighbor who said the cat gets left out every night.  He was at my door again tonight and much earlier, so once again I let him in and he jumped on the couch to purr and take a nap while nestled against me for warmth.  Now he's fast asleep in my armchair and I plan to give him a safe space to sleep out of the elements whenever he wants.

It clearly wants a nice place to be comfy at night, but is giving shelter to someone else's cat like the pet version of home wrecking?  I don't feel bad at all, if anything I think the owners are not doing a good job by forcing it outdoors especially in bad weather.

I know this sounds bad, our vet has kind of been pushing to have us put him down asap, but we don't believe it's quite the time yet. He sleeps, eats, drinks, poops, and pees quite normally, some weight loss (he is 9lbs). The problem is he is a very active cat, he likes to sleep with us so he keeps jumping on and off the bed (we have a ramp but he doesn't use it all the time), he likes to be with his humans so if we go downstairs and upstairs, he follows. He also likes to play his scratching post everyday. I see so much life in him that it doesn't quite feel right to just put him down in a few days. 

  
However, since he has just been diagnosed with CHF our vet has told us to keep him in a room with no bed and let him just stay there to minimize his activities as to not strain his heart? He has a lot of fluid in his chest that is making it heavy to breath, just started Salix so hopefully that helps. We don't want to put him down just yet, but staying in one room sounds like a terrible way for him to enjoy the rest of his life...

Separated at end as black one seemed a bit vicious and orange one looked like he was trying to escape and failing.

Orange cat is 1.5 years, black one is 7 months. Don’t live in same household. Introduced correctly when black kitten was about 15 weeks. They see each other around twice a week maximum. Always in orange cats house. They always fight, rarely sit peacfullly with each other. During fights, occasional hissing and meowing. Orange one sometimes runs away and black one pursues constantly. We have put a lead on black one at times so he can’t chase orange one, sometimes orange one initiates fights but also spends a lot more time at a distance when black one is restricted. When door shut between them orange one will paw at door and meow for the other one. 

Unsure if this is normal or if they shouldn’t be allowed together? Worried that maybe black one is terrorising orange one?

He was found on the street, and moved between shelters a lot. I live in a busy inner city apartment and he seems to be very nervous of the sounds of the city. Dogs barking and cars especially. I've been playing Music for Cats by David Teiei which seems to help. 

My issue is, two nights ago He got brave and went exploring the rest of the house at night. He accidentally knocked a plate down and made a huge crash. 
He seemed ok after, hid under the bed for a bit but came back into bed after a bit. 
Then this morning I was walking around my room, and walked behind him as he was eating, and it absolutely panicked him. Now he won't come near me for longer than a second for a quick pat. He even hissed at me when I tried to give him some tuna as a treat. He won't leave my bedroom at all and runs under the bed if I come near him. 

I've left him in my room with all the windows in the house closed for sound, Music for Cats on repeat in the lounge and the bedroom door slightly ajar. 
I have to be at work for 8 hours now and i am just so worried about him. He's been fine left before, and I have been slowly working up to a full 8 hour day apart, but after his scares I'm worried.

The other day, my SO was eating dinner and she just came up to him and bit his arm (drew blood!) unprovoked. This morning, after playing with her, I was sitting down and she grabbed and scratched + bit my ankle. The past few incidents have occurred in the kitchen; these incidents are growing in frequency.

Doing some internet research tells me she is maybe trying to initiate play? But the biting and drawing blood is clearly a behavioral issue (these are definitely not nips; they're full on chomps). We are not sure what to do. When we give her Gabapentin (we need to for us to be able to trim her nails or go to the vet), she is obviously more chill. I know the original shelter gave her Gabapentin for anxiety for the first few months of her intake because she was so anxious.

my spouse and I adopted a male cat in the beginning of 2020. He is the sweetest thing and we absolutely adore him. However, he does have a very odd habit and we are constantly wondering if this is normal. As we get ready to go to bed (our place is very small, only 500 ft.² so we are never going far from his usual resting place) no matter the time of day or night he will *run* in the room and begin howling very loudly. He will do this regardless if I’m taking a nap at 2 o’clock in the afternoon or if I’m getting to bed late at one in the morning…But anytime we start to settle down he will absolutely lose his mind. There is no stopping him either, we try to get him to settle, pet him, welcome him onto the bed, let him dig under the covers- he is relentless. It makes me sad because often we have to shut him out of the room because we can’t get him to stop and settle down. 
Luckily he doesn’t really mind being out of the room in the living room as his tree and toys are out there and he’ll sleep usually until about 5 AM which then I will be woken up by his relentless howling again. 

At this time I try to let him in the room and get him on the bed and calm him down. And sporadically he will get up and howl again. He is a very verbal cat, sometimes to a point I can’t even believe. During normal hours of the day he is always talking which is much appreciated as he makes a great companion.. but we seriously cannot figure out why he is doing this when we start to wind down or how to make it stop. We need sleep!! 

A couple other things of note- he gets fed wet food every evening around 6/7 o’clock. We constantly have dry food out for him and he has multiple water locations in the house and two litter boxes. We have another male cat (6 years old) who is a great friend to our 3.5 year old cat- they get along great, cuddle, bathe each other, play.. never had any issues between the two of them after their initial meeting beginning of 2020.

I don’t wanna hear the “play with her more” advice because I do that enough, I even trained her how to sit. I try to play with her before I leave for class, and in the night I play with her for 30 minutes before I feed her. Sometimes I think she’s stopped being as crazy as when she first warmed up to me, but then there’s still many times in the day where she runs around and has zoomies. Idk how long they’re supposed to last, but sometimes they last more than 30 minutes or continuously as short (5 minute) reoccurring bursts back to back for a good while. The only moments she’s not doing this is when she’s at the window or taking a nap. Every other time, she’s running around everywhere and wants to touch EVERYTHING, even when I’m folding clothes or making the bed. 

She’s able to sleep at same time as me, but she wakes me up 2 hours before my alarm and tries to scratch underneath me  and just bothers me so much. I think she tries to get comfortable on me but she just continuously walks over me, bites my legs, gets under the covers to keep messing with me, and scratches the blankets. I still think that she’s worse in the day, where she does unnecessary stuff like scratch the tv that’s not even on and randomly attacks me. 

Is her age an appropriate age for all this? I have many friends with cats around her age, some even with kittens, and my cat is a complete menace compared to all the other cats I’ve met who don’t care about people or are calmly on people’s lap the entire time.

She's currently at the teenager years and is running around our small apartment in bursts of energy. We play with her fairly consistently and try to make sure we follow the Cat Mojo method (Hunt, Catch, Kill, Eat, Groom, Sleep) and play with her before we feed her for about 30-45 minutes twice a day, once at 8:30am and once at 8:30pm. Like I said, we live in a pretty small, open-concept apartment and our bedroom is essentially just the attic of a 3 story building. Because of that, we don't have a proper door but rather a set of stairs. And that was all fine until we brought in a kitten. Like I said she's pretty energetic and loves to run around the apartment and get into everything, and this is doubled in the morning around 5am. Lately she's been a complete nuisance, getting into things she knows she's not supposed to, biting wires, scratching up the box spring, pretty much anything she can play with to wake us up. We think it has something to do with daylight savings time, as she'd usually do this around 6 when my girlfriend wakes up for work, but regardless it's pretty irritating and while I understand this is ""just a cat thing"", we'd like to work out some solutions here.

We were considering getting a baby gate and locking her out when she gets like this but as you can see, [the stairway](https://imgur.com/a/qtgAuB3) is pretty wide and there's tons of little nooks and crannies she can get around in.

Usually I always give him the attention he wants and it doesn't come to this, but sometimes he wants to play in the morning when I'm not even out of bed yet so I tend to have the '10 more minutes' mindset. This almost always happened in the morning.

Over the past couple days, I’ve had them both together and exploring, and the best way I can describe the older kitten’s attitude is fixated and obsessed. 

She will ignore everything and watch the younger kitten. She constantly runs up and smacks her quite hard, but without claws as far as I can tell the growling is getting less, but she will not leave the younger kitten alone. At all. Constantly chasing her, running up to her, smacking her. Even if I lift the kitten up onto the couch and block her with my leg, the older one will run around the couch to find a way to see the younger one. Nonstop. Relentless. Fixated.

Yes he’s been to the vet .

In the past couple of weeks he has been jumping up on my bed and clawing at the covers which scratches the heck out of me, and if I leave my arms out from under the blankets he will straddle them and start biting and rabbit kicking.  Most of the time he is purring while he does so, and it’s not as hard as I know he can bite but it still really hurts and always wakes me up.

Now this behavior has worsened.  Every night, multiple times through the night he wakes me up by biting at my face/head or hair, and he’s even straddled my head and rabbit kicked and clawed the shit out of my head.

I’ll usually get him off of my head and put him on the ground, but he will just hop back on the bed, walk back over to me and resume whatever he is doing.  This isn’t soft bites or kicks, it’s very painful and I end up just covering myself entirely under the sheets, which he will claw at and scratch me through, and then I inevitably just get up and go sleep outside my room.

The worst part is that if I get up, he’s fine.  If I lie on the floor, he’s fine, but if I go to my bed, even if I sit up on the bed he will meow at me, claw at me and bite me until I get up.  He doesn’t want fed because I tried that and he didn’t seem to eager to eat all his food, but I haven’t tried playing with him because usually I’m so pissed off that I’m not about to reward him with playtime.

I always play with him for like 30 minutes before I go to bed and I usually watch him go curl up in his cat tree while I get ready for bed myself.

I can’t let him outside my room unless I am with him because I have two roommates and if they get up before me and leave the house I’m worried he may escape out the front door, or that he will break their items while I’m sleeping and then I’ll have to pay for them.

Because she is a senior cat I’m worried about stressing her out by moving her, but I know she’s less stressed here where it’s far more quiet than with my family’s dogs. She’s adjusting fine but definitely spends more time under my bed and I just want to make sure she’s comfortable here, despite the location change and being away from my mom and dad.

My wife and I were recently talking about adopting a couple of cats and are wondering if it is wise to try to rescue the kittens. The mother and the kittens are definitely feral. I’ve read that kittens can be socialized up to four months or so.

Would it be a good idea to try to adopt and socialize two of the kittens? Does anyone familiar with Hawaii know what we could do with the other kittens? The local Humane Society does not accept feral cats at this time and I’m not sure where else to go.

Or would it be a better idea to leave the kittens with their mother and just adopt cats from the local Humane Society?

She’s super sweet and precious. However over the last year, she has begun to urinate relentlessly all over the house and it’s driving me insane.

This all began when I first got pregnant. She started peeing on our laundry randomly. I thought she had an UTI so I took her to the vet. The vet told us everything looked fine but gave us an antibiotic just incase. We saw no real improvement in the inappropriate urinating. She then started to pee on the carpets randomly. We thought maybe she didn’t like the box and/or liter she was using, so we changed those out - Didn’t help. I had husband start cleaning her boxes out twice a day - didn’t help. I thought maybe she needed more love and attention - didn’t help. We’ve been just fighting random inappropriate urination by cleaning with enzyme cleaner assuming it was a behavioral issue due to her sensing my new pregnancy hormones, hoping it would eventually pass. The vet said she must be stressed about something causing the behavior since it would come and go. No medical issues have been identified. 

Well since baby has been born 5 months ago, she’s gotten relentless about it. She’s refusing to use her liter box all together. Our son is extremely colicky ( he has a lot of food allergies that we’ve been discovering/removing from his diet) and spends a great deal of time screaming. Hubs &amp; I are pretty certain that kitty isn’t adjusting to baby and is incredibly anxious from his screaming. She’s ruined our upstairs carpet, some hardwood floors, countless pairs of shoes/bags/clothes. I have to clean the bathtubs out daily because she now is pooping in there. There seems to be no rhyme or reason behind locations or textures of where she is going. She hasn’t soiled anything of the baby’s yet but if she does, that will likely push it overboard. We’ve tried anxiety meds, allowing her to go outside, checking for other medical issues. The vet told us as she acclimates it should stop, but it isn’t getting any better - it keeps getting worse. I’m at a 100% loss on how to make this transition easier for her. 

This new Mom is growing exhausted of constantly cleaning up cat pee and poop.  Husband is down to two pairs of shoes after her ruining all of his other ones. Babe is starting to show signs of wanting to crawl - which terrifies me that he’ll accidentally find one of her random spots. 

How do I help her transition &amp; calm down so she can use her liter box again? I feel like I’m running out if options... If we can’t solve this issue, I’m scared we may need to consider rehoming her. However I’m sure it’s damn near impossible to rehome a cat with urination problems… I can’t imagine taking her to a shelter and something terrible happening to her. I’ve never been one to ever consider rehoming a pet, but this is getting out of control and could be a real health hazard for our son. Any advise on how to fix this issue?

Today I made the decision that since i’m moving to another continent that my amazing and sweet cat will not be coming with me as it would be intensely stressful to be fostered for months and then reuniting with me (airplane and train rides, etc). It was about ~$2700 to cargo her to the UK with me, which was not in budget. My other option was to get someone to foster her till August when I can return to bring her with me and have the space ready. I thought about it and spoke to several people and they have all told me that it would be awfully stressful for her mentally. 

It’s the most difficult decision I’ve ever made in my life and I am absolutely devastated and beyond heartbroken because she’s saved my life the 3 years I’ve had her (not an exaggeration), but it’s best for her to not have all of the stress of 8 months without me and then travelling 12-15 hours to a new place, plus being fostered she will get used to her foster parents and then be sad when she leaves them. It’s not fair to her. So I am deciding to rehome her to a family or person that can always be there for her and be constantly there. I have a month and a half left with her before I am deciding to drop her off to her forever home. I will probably never see her again. 

Does it ever get better? I feel selfish for wanting to put her through that long gruelling journey. Will I ever come to forgive myself for this? Will she forgive me?

She bailed eventually, but the kittens have stuck around and we feed them, they’re now about 13-14 months old. The ginger and tortie have been steadily growing, but the calico just stopped one day. She still pretty much looks like a kitten. 

Is it possible she has dwarfism, or could she just be a very small cat? Does she appear abnormally small? She was the runt of her litter and always the most skittish. Not food motivated at all, and I’ve never been able to touch her. She is so skittish that she evaded us BOTH rounds we tried to TNR which stresses me out, but at 13 months she hasn’t been in heat yet either. Not sure if that’s a consequence of her size or something else, but other than these two things she appears healthy. If anyone could weigh in I’d appreciate it - I want to trap her to be spayed , but if there’s any chance she has a disorder I’ll get her to the vet for blood work before going strait to a TNR clinic.

Today though I noticed something a little worrisome. My kitten was eating the dogs food! I have been giving the kitten wet food alongside his dry food and his bowl is never empty. So he isn't starving or anything. I know that my dog would eat the kittens food if he could get to it too (The kittens food is on the patio where the dog can't go). That's not really relevant. I worry about malnutrition if the kitten keeps doing this. My dog is too old, and blind, to try to schedule when he eats (he has been free eating since he was a couple months old).

We rescued our two kittens back in March and we were so in love - they were about four months. Our younger baby, Tig, was very skinny and small but they couldn’t find anything wrong with her at the time. We rescued her knowing she would likely have health problems but we didn’t know the extent of it. All I can say is GET PET INSURANCE!!! It allowed us to treat her to the best extent possible and they paid out £12,000 in six months. We are in the U.K. so might be better here not sure. 

About a month in, she started acting a bit strange and sleeping a lot. We took her to the vet who suspected she had FIP but gave us some other things to try. Fast forward, she almost died in the vet hospital with her stomach full of fluid but we were so lucky to save her with a newer approved drug in the U.K. it involved us giving her a shot daily in her back/neck for two weeks which was extremely traumatic honestly. We finally switched to a pill form and three months later, she seemed to be fully recovered. But as soon as she came off the pills, we noticed she started having diahrrea. 

We did every test, multiple stool samples, two ultrasounds, a colon biopsy to finally settle on her having developed IBS. This took about 4 months and the diahrrea just got worse and worse to the point where she can’t control when she goes. There was also a lot of blood in her stool. She’s now not always able to make it to the litter tray and we are cleaning up poop all over our flat and washing sheets/towels anything we can use to keep it off our furniture. The thing is she’s still eating and has some good days. We were finally able to start her on steroids a week and a half ago but it hasn’t made a difference yet. 

We love her so much and couldn’t imagine giving her away or putting her down. But I’m terrified she won’t get better and we’ve given our lives to her the last six months. I thought we saved her only to now watch her deal with this IBS. It’s so heartbreaking but I’m also trying to be strong. I just want her to get better so badly.

I recently adopted a cat almost a month ago who was considered unadoptable due to his spicy personality. Since bringing him home, he has come out of his shell more and will freely walk around and explore usually after 9pm. He eats, drinks, uses his litter box and has night zoomies. I haven’t attempted to pet him since he seems to be scared of hands coming towards him.

The adoption place didn’t have much background on him before he came to them, but I believe due to his behavior he may have been abused and/or abandoned. At night time, I’ll lay on my couch while he hides under it and I will watch him play with his spring toys. He is incredibly happy and loves to play with them while I “watch” him using my phone’s camera (so I’m not directly watching him). I believe me being in front of him scares him.

During the day, I try to play with him so he doesn’t have any play aggression, however if I sit on the ground or grab his favorite toy, he will hiss at me and growl (while slowly approaching me from under the couch) until I back away. I’m not sure what is causing him to do this. At night he is completely loving and has no fear of me. I’m not sure if it just requires more patience until I build more trust with him or what.

He has a cat tree with hiding spots, I have pheromone spray, lots of toys, and have blocked off under my bed/top of cabinets. Any advice would be great. This is my first cat that has had aggression towards me &amp; I would love to be able to provide a safe space for him to live.",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,116564,public,self,Fear Aggression?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/yozzf0/fear_aggression/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

He's been such a good boy and has given me no trouble.   


I work night shift (11pm-7am) during the week, with weekends off. On my weekends, sometimes I like to stay up all day and have a somewhat normal (but often sporadic) sleeping schedule. During the weekend I'll either reverse my sleeping schedule or sleep at random times, giving me time to have a life and do some errands.   


My question is, how much does this affect my cat? He doesn't seem to mind, and he will let me know when he's hungry and when he wants to play. I have no set feeding schedule on the weekends, I leave kibble for him and he snacks on it, but he always waits for wet food for his full meals. I feed him wet food usually 3 times per day, usually half a can at a time, but on the weekends it's at more random times. Basically I just need to know that this OK, but not ideal. I play with him a lot every day, usually 2+ hours day. When he gets older I plan on having a more concrete feeding schedule, as I won't be on night shift forever.

Last year, we lived in a house in the burbs without another cat, but he had a lot of room to run and was very active, watched birds and squirrels out the window, would occasionally go on leashed walks in the backyard, and had more people to give him attention. He was really happy there. He seemed bored when we moved to a new city apartment in June, and became less interested in toys so we thought a new companion would be good for him in the new apartment.

Almost every day he will poop or pee outside of the litter box and it’s causing distress for my family. These aren’t little messes either, and they take a long time to clean up. This really stresses out my mom and she’s the person that usually has to clean them up. Now for some background information, we got our cat in 2020 when he was a few months old, and then we fostered him. Previous to that he had been living with a vet tech with no other kittens. If you have any knowledge of fostering cats, you know that kittens need to be socialized with other kittens so they learn how to get along with other cats and it helps them emotionally develop properly. Well our cat should’ve been given to us earlier but hadn’t, but anyway we took him in with our other kittens. We already had two other cats at this point. Around New Years 2020 we adopted our cat. Then he started pooping around the house, but less often than he is now. Then we moved houses and this is when the issue started to get worse. He started mostly pooping large amounts around the house. We believe it’s mostly a behavioral issue. It’s also important to add that our cat is very small. Like at two years old he’s about half the size of a fully grown cat when he’s already full grown. He messes with one of the other cats (let’s call him tuxedo cat). Tuxedo cat and the third cat (let’s call him lion cat) our best friends and we think that when lion cats sees tuxedo cat getting bullied he then bullies the cat with issues. Lion cat bullying problem cat could be unrelated to tuxedo cat getting messed with. Anyway the problem has gotten to the point where this is our last straw. It’s too mentally difficult to deal with it every day. We’ve tried almost every solution and they haven’t worked, meanwhile the vet bills have been racking up. We recently took him to the vet again and they think it is a behavioral issue so they’re prescribing him chicken broth prozac and for him to be house trained again for two weeks. We’re doing that in my sisters room and we put a litter box in her bathroom. We think he has separation anxiety from my sister because they are really close and he’s always with her. When she’s not home (which is often because our parents are separated) he will cry outside of her door for hours.

This is my first post and I was hoping that anyone with experience or knowledge could help me.
I'll try to be brief. 4 years ago I've adopted my first cat which was already 4 years old. She has been living with me since then and we live in a small apartment (bathroom, kitchen, living room).
Yesterday, previously taking all the medical precautions with both animals, I brought to my apartment my girlfriend's cat. He will be living with us some time due to some personal issues where the cat was previously living.

The newcomer's attitude is to hide in small and dark places. He licks a bit, gets out for food/water, today he was able to use the litter-box. He walks cautiously through the apartment.
On the other hand, my cat, is being territorial. He growls at him, maintains distance and watches him silently. Usually is a very sweet cat, like a really lot, but now she is being grumpy.

I was expecting some sort of similar scenario and I think, based on similar experiences with dogs or relatives cats, that this is a common situation. 
What's I'm looking for is, based on your knowledge and experience, if there is anything that you could recommend me for making this experience ""nicer"" for them. I'm not expecting a quick solution or speed up the process, just any tips or tricks you could teach me!

My neighbor down the road had a cat colony and I guess this cat came from that colony. At first I didn’t mind her presence, she actually keeps the property mouse free.

Only one stuck around with her and I wasn’t super concerned since they weren’t coming around my house for food. I also thought since they were connected to my neighbors colony that it wasn’t really my business… until they both had kittens under my house last spring. 

I love cats, I have two of my own. But they are indoor cats. But I do not want a colony on my hands both for their safety and just generally not wanting to be held responsible for that many cats. 

I tried via two different humane societies in my area to get the two females signed up for TNR once the kittens were of weaning age but they both had wait lists that were MONTHS out. And both became pregnant again before their turn for the program came which was well into both pregnancies. Thankfully it’s just two males between them. But I tried to get at least the two moms fixed out of pocket to be done with it… but getting a SINGLE cat spayed out of pocket is 500 dollars, what the hell??? 

I feel so trapped. I tried to do the responsible thing the first time around but couldn’t get them fixed in time. Tried a more direct approach only to be smacked with a 1k price tag for cats that I don’t even consider mine ? I can’t bring this to the neighbor either as there is a language barrier.

She was obviously a pet and well cared for by someone though.  Loves people (adults and kids), well behaved, etc.  


I have a smaller house, so I bought her a covered litter box.  

Originally I used So Phresh clay litter, but it was way too dusty for a covered box.  It made me squint and cough when I added new litter, and set off my air purifier from 20 feet away.  

So I switched to Dr. Elsey Ultra....dust free and low tracking.  


The thing is, my cat doesn't seem to like it.  She didn't like the So Phresh either.  


I've got a larger covered box than she needs at her size.  And I clean it TWO TO THREE times per day.  

Every time she goes to use it though she puts her tail down and walks into it slowly, then she digs to China for 30+ seconds, kicking a ton out of the covered box/door, then leaves the box with her tail down and refuses to acknowledge me.  She will go and lay down in one of her spots for 10-15 minutes.  

I swear she kicks out a tenth of her litter box content every time she uses the bathroom.  

I have a litter collecting mat outside the box, but it doesn't help.  

I have to use my dust buster to clean her litter mat 2-3 times per day, and I have to vacuum around the litter mat 2-3 times per day as well.

When I told my roommates, they were ecstatic and wanted me to get one so badly. I think I decided to go ahead with it because of them rather than what I truly felt deep inside. 

She's a little over three months old and I've had her for two weeks now. The first week was hell since she's a total ball of energy and I couldn't figure out how to help her get it all out. Now that we have somewhat of a routine, she's sweet and friendly and seems to be happy here. I've done lots and LOTS of research, and I'd like to think that I'm taking really good care of her. She's already bonded with me quite a bit: sleeps next to me almost every night, follows me around the apartment and jumps up on my shoulder all the time. 

I truly care about her so much and I just want her to have the best life possible. However, this responsibility has been weighing on me. I'm out for hours at a time for school and work, sometimes the entire day. I have someone that I'm seeing and I want to go out on dates with them. When I'm home, I have chores, homework and I want to watch TV sometimes. But every second that I'm not paying attention to her makes me feel so guilty. I play with her for at least twenty minutes every day, but sometimes multiple hours. I got her a cat tree and several toys she can play with on her own, and my roommates are usually around to hang out with her as well, but I still feel bad whenever I go out. 

Logically, I know I'm doing everything to the best of my ability. But it's gotten to a point where every time I look at her, I'm filled with regret and the weight of the responsibility I have now, rather than joy and love for her.

We both work jobs where mid-day meals is not an option, so instead we have been doing a decent size bowl of dry kitten food (they self regulate well and a 1/4-1/2 cup lasts about the entire day). We were doing one, half 3oz can a day for each at first in combo with the dry food, but I want to up this to 1/2 can twice a day now. 

They haven’t been complaining or overly begging for food at all, I just want to make sure this seems fine and not too much/too little. 

Like I said, they self-regulate well, they drink a LOT of water, and they always get excited come wet food time so what we give is gone in ~5 minutes.

Last night my partner picked up the sister, thinking he could take her home, and that the two would get along and know who each other were. It did not go that way....

Partner called me, super stressed out, I said to just take the sister to my parents place and we can introduce them later. We were hoping they could be friends and we could socialise them at both homes. We're hoping that when we go away we can take our kitty to my parents place and when my parents go away, we can take the sister.

And recently, B has been peeing on everything.

Backstory: my husband and I adopted B from a shelter when she was 4. She had previously been in a traffic accident, and is missing her tail and her back right leg as a result. (I suspect she was the one driving the car). B is an indoor cat and always has been - we are in the UK, so this is actually quite unusual, since the majority of cats here are allowed outside. Anyway. Other than the missing limbs, and a couple of mild bouts of cystitis, B has been in great health since we adopted her. Her mobility is limited in that she can't jump up high, just scrambles onto a chair/bed, but she can run fairly fast. Personality-wise, she's a very vocal cat, pretty social and likes to curl up on my lap, but a bit 'emotionally needy'. We have had issues on and off with excessive crying at night, but that has improved in recent years.

B has occasionally done a 'stress pee' outside her litterbox, if upset by something like an unexpected houseguest. Two years ago, we had a baby, and the stress-peeing got a little bit more frequent. Ok, that's not unusual, cats need time to adapt to a baby. We didn't force any interaction, made sure B had her own baby-free retreat space, kept a Feliway running etc. Now baby is a toddler, and to be fair, they are both good companions. B hasn't displayed any aggression and will happily curl up next to toddler; toddler understands 'gentle hands' and generally respects the cat's space. One big difference is that B is now shut out of baby's room at night (she has free range over the rest of our flat).

In the last few months, B has been peeing outside her box a couple of times a week, and suddenly in the last week she is doing it every day. She has two litterboxes, always accessible, one in each bathroom, and we use the same wooden biodegradable litter that we have always used. The boxes are scooped immediately after a poop, and the litter changed weekly. But she's peeing randomly on rugs, chairs, and anything left on the floor for a moment, such as a towel. She even pees near her food bowl now.

When the issue started a few months ago, I took her to our vet. He gave her a physical checkup, found nothing wrong, and said that the issue was behavioural. Liquid fluoxetine (kitty prozac) was prescribed, which we mixed in with her wet food or a cat-yoghurt treat once a day. This worked well for about a month, but then B figured out that the food/treat had medicine mixed in, and refused to touch it. So then we were back at the original problem. I can't get her to take the food via syringe or spoon, because it causes her a huge amount of distress which defeats the whole point of prozac.

I suspect/fear that she is bored, because she will often paw at furniture or the window blinds to make a noise and get our attention. She gets lots of social attention, i.e. petting and lap time, but it's really hard to play with her because she ignores most toys, ribbons, string, balls and so on. I've bought enrichment toys for her, I try hiding ribbons under things for her to find, and she either bats at them for two minutes then loses interest, or just acts like they're not there. I suspect the missing limbs/mobility issues make it harder for her to play.

I have a call scheduled with the vet tomorrow, and obviously will be getting her checked again. She is eating and drinking normally.

Our cat is 15/16, and still quite active with no notable signs of aging. We're thinking of getting a puppy, but we're currently unsure whether to wait for our cat to pass or not.

Even though she's old, we've seen her a few times with the neighborhood cats. She doesn't show any aggression towards them whatsoever, and most the time just sits and watches them. Even when a stray use to come in at an old house and eat her food - she'd just sit there and watch. Completely chill. And we had loud dogs living next to us previously, and she never flinched when they barked at her, came to the fence etc. However she does not like children whatsoever, and will go into a bedroom if any ever come round (which is rarely).

We don't know if she has ever lived with a dog before, as she was a rescue cat about 10 years ago.

I have a 4 y/o female cat (spayed)  that has been vomiting nearly every day for most of her life. I have tried many types of food (prescription diets, grain-free, wet food, expensive brands, vitamins) but nothing seems to work. 

Nowadays, I literally only feed her 6-7 *pieces* of dry food at a time, but more frequently. She loves food and otherwise acts normal. I also noticed that she mostly throws up in the mornings. 

I took her to the vet a few months ago, but the veterinarian was not able to do a physical exam or any lab tests because she was acting very aggressively towards everyone including myself (i.e, hissing, growling, biting). This is not new behavior for her, as she generally hates car rides, her carrier, and new people. Because of this, I am not able to get a proper diagnosis for this issue. 

I just wanted to know if you all have any suggestions regarding this issue. Any advice would be helpful!

Occasionally he also comes over and starts licking her and all that.

It's not like matcha is afraid of him. She frequently runs at him and plays with him (and his tail) 
And it's not like he doesn't want to play (he ALSO initiates play)


Is he being malicious with her? Some if his behavior is nice, but why doesn't he let up when she's meowing and growling or hissing??

However, while I appreciate that he'll eat pretty much anything, other cats aren't as fond of that trait. 

I tried having a new cat here for the weekend, let's call her Girl. She seemed to love me, but hissed and growled to Greg. He was okay with it and backed off, sometimes purring gently to her. In the end they even tried playing with each other and the hissing became less frequent. 

I didn't mind she didn't eat the first evening/night, neither pellets nor fresh food. I got a bit worried today when she'd been refusing to eat for over a day. It didn't matter whether Greg was in the room or not, she refused every chance to eat, so I had her sent back home. What she didn't what, Greg would happily devour when I turned around. The bastard has ate enough for an entire week, stumbling away from his last meal. 

My next plan is to let Greger spend next weekend at another place (where he feels at home), have the new cat spend the weekend alone with me and see if she'll be comfortable eating. 

Is this a decent idea? I tried separating them, closing doors (both complained loudly about the door being closed), tried different types of food, to no avail.

I’m a minor, and I live with my parents, so I really don’t have a whole lot of control in some ways over our cats. 

Anyways, we have two cats. Both initially were outdoor cats who would come inside always at night and whenever they wanted to. They probably were inside more than outside, but were free to roam out in our yard especially since we had no neighbors at the time. Then, we ended up moving into an apartment. Our cats (M4) and (F9) have been indoor cats since then, as we have no easy access to the outdoors for them. I don’t think they’ve minded being indoor cats, though my boy cat has tried to sneak out into the hallways thinking it’s the outdoors and ends up meowing at the door; also, he has gained a bit of weight since he has been an indoor cat. 

Unfortunately, we have to move again, and my parents really want our cats to be outdoor cats again. I really am worried about it as they could get eaten by coyotes, hit by a car, or contract parasites etc. But they won’t take no for an answer- and refused my catio ideas or only supervised outdoor time idea. I’m at school all day and my parents work all day, so if my parents leave them outside in the morning, chances are they will be unsupervised until I come home in the late afternoon. The only thing my parents have conceded is to never let them be outside at night.

I would like my boy cat which is the overweight one to have more exercise, so maybe it wouldn’t be all bad to have him get some outdoor time. However, I’m also worried about bird populations- as he used to hunt when he was a kitten. Not to mention- a big concern of mine is that they haven’t been outside in years and what if they don’t know how to take care of themselves out there anymore? Our girl cat is feral and very small; she is in incredible health, but when she was an outdoor cat she would always hide underneath our porch, and to be honest, I think she could get eaten so easily.

what do you think I should do? it’s pretty much impossible to persuade my parents, but is there any way i can protect their safety while I’m at school and make the transition easier for them? My parents said they don’t have to go outside if they don’t want to, but I know my parents will take my cat meowing at the door as him wanting to be outside.

Recently adopted a cat from a local shelter last Tuesday, for the most part its been going smoothly but the last day or so he's been sneezing a lot. I'm wondering if this could be caused by the clumping litter he uses?

Because when we got him, the shelter gave us a little adoption kit which included one a disposable, ready to use litter box. Which was basically just a tinfoil pan with some basic litter in it, we used that for the first couple days and on Thursday we swapped to a a regular box and some fragrance-free clumping litter, specially Tidy Cats Free and Clean Clumping. Then on Friday and Saturday we noticed he started sneezing a bit. The shelter told us that he was mostly healthy (save an unrelated factor) and I don't think they'd lie, so the sneezing seems to be new. Any chance this could be related to the litter and if so are there any recommendations for other litter he won't sneeze?

I adopted my cat a couple of months ago and used to give him baby food because the vet advised so for a couple of months and then slowly introduced wet food.

I used to give him dry food too earlier and it seemed to be okay for him. From about 2 weeks he has been having digestion issues and whenever I give him dry food, he gets loose stools. 

Two times now i completely removed dry food until he was okay but if i give him a fistful of dry food once a day, he gets loose stools again.

I've been using the same brand (whiskas) for his dry food. Is there any possible reason why he may have such reaction to it?

But she’s also SO floofy. Thankfully, she loves being brushed and pampered and even does ok with nail trimmings. 

I’d really like to get into grooming a bit more. Her mane, fluffy pants, and toe tufts are a bit too long which causes her to track litter out of the box

Back in the day I was a vet assistant so I have a solid understanding of how to hold her for these things in a way that’s safe for everyone. I’d like to do this stuff at home to save myself some money and save Nala the stress of leaving the house. That said, I wouldn’t mind a bit of start-up cost on some quality grooming tools.

Looking for recs on brushes, trimming scissors/ clippers, and anything else to help keep her beautiful floof healthy and sanitary. Also any books, websites, or YouTube channels that you’ve found helpful. Thanks!

Everything went well, we got supplies from them etc. and just as we were to drive off from the possession the kitten got out of my friends hands before being put in the box and slipped through the slightly opened car's door. He ran behind the house and we immediately went looking for him. We spent more than an hour looking for him with the owners on their property and the close neighbourhood (there's some grassy terrain there and other homes, not much trees though), but he just couldn't be found, and we had to get back to our place as it was getting dark anyway. 

We joked that he probably is hiding somewhere and looking at us the whole time, and the owners said they don't worry too much and that they can get him to us when he gets found, but it's been close to 22 hours now with nothing and I'm very worried. It's getting cold outside and it's been raining.

As far as I've heard, he wasn't always completely indoor, even though they do keep him inside now, they said he had a tendency to hide in their car's engine (we checked that thoroughly).

I'm honestly really scared for the cat and my friend's well being (she has been through A LOT, and now I'm pretty sure she's blaming herself and thinking she must be cursed or something). But I do know it is our fault and I too feel really terrible about it. 

I did some research yesterday and wrote to the owners suggesting to put the kitten's litter box outside so it would help him get home by the smell, but there's still no sign of it. And it's not like a bigger city where I could find a fb group to post a notice.

Do any of you think that after this time there's still a chance for him to be found ? Or at least a chance that nothing bad happened to him and someone just took him or something?

I am looking for a little advice on having a multi cat home. 

Backstory - I have a 4 year old ginger boy named Kevin. For his entire like it’s mostly just been us, so he’s a little on the spoiled side. A few months ago we moved in with my long time boyfriend and then one week age, we brought home a 14 week old Sphynx kitten name Ira. 

We did the usual quarantine period for Ira, we scent swapped, we added Feliway diffusers to our house, we fed them on opposite sides of the door and after about 3 days my resident cat seemed ready to meet the newcomer. 

The first day was lots of hissing and growling from Kevin, the second day significantly less, and the third day Kevin never made a peep. 

So overall, they seem to be doing well! My question is: Kevin seems to follow Ira literally everywhere, is that normal? Also what other behavior is pretty typical when introducing cats for the first few weeks/months and when can they be left alone together? 

Kevin was my first cat and Ira is my second so I’m really new to all of this.

I adopted a kitten of about 5 months old in August and he has settled in nicely.

He's an orange cat (had to mention that), gets zoomies like any another active cat but he sometimes plays too agressively. I have tried hissing, assertively saying no and other suggestions i have heard from cat people but nothing works.

Due to some religious reasons my family members don't want him to get neutered which i have heard helps in calming down male cats.

A lot of the times she just runs away. I will slowly kneel down as to not scare/startle her but as soon as I reach my hand out, she bolts. I in general am the main care taker of both kittens (feed, clean, play) 70% of the time. My fiancé does about 30% and our roommate is not expected to do anything but he plays with them sometimes. 
I notice the female kitten seems to really like our roommate and will sometimes even go up to him on her own to get pet.

I really need help with a situation in my house. My boyfriend and I (24F/28M) took in a kitten a few weeks ago when he was just 4-5 weeks old because a friend asked us to. I warned him that it wasn’t a good idea as we had a senior cat at the time, but we kept him anyways. He spent weeks 2-4 being handled and bottle fed by the friends we got him from. We believe they may have played with them with their hands when he had just started to open his eyes and walk due to his behaviors now. Our senior was adopted just a few months before him and really didn’t like him. She actually got very attached to my boyfriends parents and now lives with them and has a very happy life. Fast forward to now, we have tried EVERYTHING. And I mean everything- to get him to stop biting. I’m not talking about kitten nibbles or love bites- he bites HARD. We’ve tried doing more play time and deterring with toys but he has no interest in any type of toy once he sees us walking away. Yelping, saying “ouch”, pulling away all make him bite even harder. He’s incredibly play aggressive like nothing I or any of my friends have seen before. I have scars all up my arm just from the time we got him at 4 weeks old to now at 10 weeks old. In a last ditch effort to try to chill him out, we got another kitten today as recommended by our vet. I may be jumping the gun since it is only day 1, but he will not leave her alone. Luckily she is a very patient and confident cat who really shows a lot of interest in him, but even still she doesn’t like him constantly swatting at her. He isn’t hurting her or using claws, he just keeps slapping her over and over. I know I should be patient and give it time, but I am really considering revoking him. The only thing holding me back is the fear that he will be put down by a shelter due to how aggressive he is.

I have no issues with his attitude, his energy level, nothing. I knew what I was getting into when it came to the kitten and his needs. And he is actually a lot sweeter and easier to take care of than I anticipated! But the reason I am considering taking him back is because of my severe anxiety disorder and my senior dog. Although I have no problem playing with the kitten, and all the other things that he needs, I can't seem to control my anxiety ever since I got him. It feels like I am always on the edge of an anxiety attack. I do think a week is a very short period in time. But my dog is also not the hugest fan of the kitten (which I was worried about). He isn't aggressive or anything, it just seems like he is avoiding the kitten and has gotten a lot clingier and depressed. The kitten doesn't mind my dog though, if anything he actually has been trying to cuddle with him.

&amp;#x200B;

Although I agree that it is possible that more time might help, I also know my dog and my anxiety very well. And I don't think that this will just go away in another couple of weeks or even months. I feel like such a terrible person for wanting to take the kitten back when he is so sweet. He has done absolutely nothing wrong. At the end of the day it seems like he is just not the right fit for us. I think that if I do take him back, I won't be adopting again until my dog passes. I think it is just the best situation for the both of us for now.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm mostly posting this because I want to know if anyone else has had to make a tough choice like this? I am worried that I will regret taking him back.

We took him off the street as a rescue, and he grew up as an only cat so he is naturally quite needy and demanding of attention. I also think he didn't learn the bite inhibition too well since he never grew up with playmates. He loves to play bite and I never intentionally encouraged this behavior but I dont know how to get it to stop. 

I moved in with a new partner about 2 months ago, and my cat loves my partner and rarely seems to bite him unless clearly provoked. Yet my cat still bites me in 2 situations almost on the daily: ambushing my feet which he finds absolutely delightful but I don't know how to get him to stop. I have scars on my legs. 

He gives both of us affection for petting (he seeks my attention more frequently) but he ONLY bites me! And when we have guests he doesn't do it to them when they pet him (unless they irritate him by touching his stomach, etc). And when I pet him, he only bites me! I cant see any way that i pet him any differently than my partner or any guests that come over to our home. Granted, he doesn't bite hard, it always seems to be a playful bite but he does still on occasion break skin and I don't know how to discourage this behavior nor do I know why he only does it to me. 

When I see him hiding and eyeing out my feet, I sometimes try to get a toy and throw it near him so he gets distracted but then he plays with it for 10 seconds and then looks for the next opportunity to ambush my feet. And when he bites me when I pet him I stop petting him and giving him attention. I don't know what to do next.

Now he is good and wants lots of attention. He always comes to me to be petted and purrs. The only thing is that when he is close to my legs he bites me (not a strong bite) and he never licks me. 
So I was thinking is it possible he thinks that biting is a sign of affection and he doesn’t know that he can lick me instead??
He is still scared sometimes. Also it happens sometimes he hisses at me when I walk from a room to another. 
I tried to tell him everytime with loud voice not to do it even when he bites me and clap my hands but nothing, he doesn’t stop!!

October's Backstory: October was OG a stray, he shows signs of being VERY cautious and nervous and for the first 3 days only hid within the room. NOTE: I am following Jackson Galaxy's Guide to Cat Introductions.

For past few days he comes when I walk into the room, loves to be pet, and loves to play. He eats treats out of my hand too. HOWEVER, he hasn't shown signs of wanting to get out at all to explore more of the house. Sometimes he even runs under the bed when I open the door, it's 50/50 if he comes or runs. I have not heard him scratch/meow at the door or try to dart out.

My 9yr old *Minda* tends to hiss and growl under the crack in the door, but instantly runs if she even spots him (he will peek outside the door when I go to leave sometimes) then walks back to door and hisses underneath it. She even seems cautious when she walks by the door.

Minda's Backstory: She grew up with my now gone 14yr old kitty since she was 6 weeks old, so she HAS had experience with other cats. HOWEVER back when Dad was married to a girl who had two Cats Minda would growl, hiss, and chase her cats to the point where they would hide and hardly come out. I'm afraid she will treat October the same bc he isn't a cat she grew up with.

I am still on the first 2 stages (Keep in basecamp and scent swapping) as he has shown no signs of wanting to sight swap yet. I'm worried at this point that he won't show any signs of wanting to explore more (ik it's only been one week, but when I first moved into new trailer it took Minda 1 week to realise it was her new home and to not hide). NOTE: I did put him in my arms and walked around the house in hopes it would trigger some curiosity.   However he buried his face into my arms most of the tour, it was probably too overwhelming - Minda was trapped in Bathroom during tour to make sure she didn't see him or hiss at him.

Does anyone have any cat introduction stories that are similar to mine that ended on a positive note? Any advice to help his curiosity to want to explore so I can begin the next step?

Maybe look for some advice too. 

In July i got a kitten, Eddie. He was 3 months old, a tiny little black/brown, white furball. I have another cat, Monty, who turned one end of October. First day we got eddie, we sat with him in our spare room, letting him explore and meet us. He took to us almost immediately, I remember he sat on my laps and just started purring and squinting his eyes at me. We forgot to close the door properly and Monty managed to squeeze through because hes an impatient little a-hole and to my surprise he was very accepting of eddie. 
Eddie was a great kitten. He would come and sleep with us, never bit or scratched intentionally. He would do that meerkat thing cats do when they want to see something clearer. He came to the rescue whenever i was upset, curling up next to me and purring away. He was quiet on our way to the vets, even though the bus rides were bumpy.  He did some funny things, like try to cover his poo by scratching everything but the litter. Honestly, i’d say we struck gold with him. 
About three weeks ago he started to get ill. He had runny poops, sometimes he’d vomit, became more lethargic, stopped going out and started following me everywhere. We took him to the vets several times. He was on anti-inflammatory syrups, then different foods, then antibiotics. Last week the vet ran some tests and diagnosed him with coronavirus, said with the symptoms he has it sounds like FIP. We went back on Thursday and after scanning his stomach, she found fluid and advised us to put him down. We agreed and we stayed with him until the end. 

I was crying so much. I’m an emotional person, and all it takes is a sad advert to make me cry. So you can imagine how bad i was sobbing. Eddie and Monty are our first pets we had. (I’ve had dogs and cats when i lived with my parents but these two were the pets i bought with my own money, and bought their food etc) so this is the first time i had to put down an animal. When she administered the anaesthetic he was gone in 2 seconds. His head just dropped and his eyes just dilated. Every time i think about it i can just imagine his eyes, so lifeless. We decided to get him cremated so looking forward to him coming back home. 

I don’t think i was ever this sad. Everything just reminds me of him. I’ll cry for a bit then stop and cry again in like 2 hours. I haven’t ate much, don’t feel like eating. I haven’t slept in my bed, i haven’t really left the house since Thursday, haven’t spoke with my family. I miss him so much. I’m scared that whatever cat i’ll get next i’ll expect to be like Eddie, and i’ll hate them if it’s not. My partner would like another cat in the future because i agree, the house feels empty when it’s just us and Monty. But i’m not sure if i can get another cat, maybe not yet at least. I dunno what to do with myself, i dunno what to do moving forward. It feels like i’m waiting for him to come back. I just think about how we were gonna have Christmas together, he was gonna see snow and a Christmas tree for the first time. But now he’s somewhere on his own, probably cremated by now :( and he’ll never get to experience these things. He was just a little baby. And i miss him so much. I know this whole thing might be weird to some of you, but he really meant the world to me.

I have a 2 and 1/2 year old Tabby female whole lives indoor only. She randomly started peeing outside of her litter box about a year ago and we have no idea why. We have another cat with her and he is about the same age and they get along really well. We clean their three litter boxes twice a day, have a pet water fountain, and they always have food in their bowl. Nothing new to their environment and same routine every day. 

She pees anywhere. She doesn't have a favorite spot. Two mattresses, one sofa, 4 rugs, and a comforter have all fallen victims to her piss. We recently spayed her (3 months ago) with the hope that she'd stop. Relief lasted up until yesterday when we found another of our rugs peed on. We have talked to the vet already before she got spayed and basically got told that it might be due to environment or we could testing to see if it could be something medical. Have you gone through something similar? If so, what was it and how was it stopped?

In my previous house, I kept her inside only for the first year and a half of her life. Whilst I had to play with her for an hour after work, and a half an hour or so before bed, we made it work most of the time (she is prone to boredom), until she managed to get outside a few times. After that, she would cry at the front door every night. We didn't have a garden of our own, and didn't want to risk her roaming around wherever (despite it being common in the UK). She eventually started getting what seemed to be idiopathic cystitis. The vet told us it could be the stress from not being able to go outside that was causing it (in reality, it seemed due to the wooden pellets we were using in her litter tray, we found out much later). We made the decision to speak to all of our neighbours and asked if they were happy with her being in their garden, all of which were. I appreciate you can't really ever know how far you cat goes if you let them free roam, but she was almost always in view of our house. She went into the gardens directly next to and behind us. At the front of our house, the furthest she would go is about 10 meters in either direction, and almost never across the street.   


Our new house has a small garden, it also has a large public green space at the front of it (it's a cricket pitch for those who know how large they typically are). Whilst I knew dog walkers frequented the area, I had no idea it had become a space in which dog owners were exercising their dogs off lead/leash, and as such, some are often walk by my house without full control of their dog. I've spoken to the developer for the area (It's an up and coming town, with only the first phase of development completed) about how this potentially might cause a multitude of different issues, and they're going to raise it at their next meeting, but it's unlikely anything will be done until  they develop their specfic dog park area, which won't be any time soon.  
Luckily, so far, my cat hasn't shown an interest in going outside yet, but I know she will soon. My current house is twice the size of the old one, but I know it won't keep her entertained for much longer. I've been trying my best to play with her after work and before bed, but she quickly gets bored of any toys (I switch them out daily).  


My question is, do you think my cat would be content enough if I cat proof my small garden? It's about 8 x 6 meters. My gut tells me I would be stupid to let her free roam with the amount of dogs in the area out front, but everyone I've spoken to have told me it would ""probably"" be fine. If I cat proof my garden, I wouldn't be able to give her much in regards to vertical space as it would make the cat proofing useless and the area isn't large enough to do it in the middle of the garden, but she would at least have something outside, although no where near as stimulating as what she had before. I'm worried about her mental health, as she seems to get bored a lot (and she'll let you know it!), even before the move. If she hadn't had enough stimulation in the day, she would meow her head off in the night until one of us showed her any sort of attention. I appreciate mental health only really matters if you're not getting mauled to death by a dog...  


I appreciate this is probably a hard question for anyone to answer without knowing my cat and knowing the area, but I love my cat.

They were found on the street when they were around 6 weeks old. While our female cat shows typical cat behaviour, our male cat really is an adventurer. Starting at around 8 months old he was roaming more and we noticed that he liked to follow us and strangers on walks. We don't mind that he likes to interact with strangers, however he seems to get lost frequently. He used to get posted in the local pet group on facebook weekly and now that he is wearing a necklace with our phone number, we get called around one to three times per week. Some tales of his adventures:
- he joins people for more than 1 hour walks. This is of course very entertaining to them. Several times he seemed to have followed different groups and got stranded more than 5 km away (this was during our holiday). When he is walking too far he doesn't seem to find his way back and seems very stressed.
- he is very vocal, likes attention and tries to break into houses 
- he also tried to break into supermarkets and kept breaking into a pharmacy 
- he jumps into cars and already got a car lift because people didn't notice he was in there
- he likes to hide in bushes and then jumps onto small dogs, probably because he wants to play (one lady here referenced him as ""oh the terror cat!"")
Luckily people in our neighborhood are very nice and attentive and keep calling us for him. 
This week he was gone for more than 24-40 hours on two occasions, which always makes us worry a) that he got lost again and b) that someone is catnapping him. It most often ends with us being called, sometimes us finding him somewhere or him finding his way back to us. Does anyone know why a cat would behave like he does and if there is anything we can do so that he doesn't get lost so often? We were thinking of giving him a GPS device (or maybe a navigation 😅), unfortunately they seem to be very bulky and he already hates his necklace. I have to say that when he is at home he does seem to be very happy with us and our service.

I recently adopted 2 ragdoll kittens who are littermates. I’ve had them for about a week now and today while I was on the phone they were running around playing like normal. Then all of a sudden I noticed my one cat who was on the floor was looking up at her brother with an arched back completely stiff. The brother was on my bed just laying there at the edge, he didn’t look like he was going to pounce on her or anything until they made eye contact.

The brother jumps down in front of her and she began to hiss at him. Eventually it turns into chasing, biting, swatting and running away like their normal playtime, but every time he would approach she would arch her back until eventually the two of them were arched and running sideways at/away from each other. Once I realized they may be fighting I took out a feather wand with a bell on it to distract them which seemed to work, but now I’m a bit worried to leave them alone in the room, especially since they’ll be alone for the majority of the day tomorrow.

They are kept in separate rooms. Both cats go outside, but orange (scaredy pants) no longer goes out when tuxedo (my alpha cat) is out, so she barely goes now at all :( maybe only at night when my big boi is sleeping. They don't clash territories at all indoors but orange is always on alert when my room door is being open or closed. Sometimes her interest gets a better of her and she goes to sniff my door, but then she involuntarily gets angry and hisses (she is a gemini lol), so sometimes curious but very high alert. She even sometimes just slaps me because I smell like my cat and is only willing to come on my lap when her mom isn't home (she needy but scaredy lol). Okay so it's a bad situation.

My tuxedo cat is a huge floof and the orange one is smol. Both are 10yo tho but healthy and spirited. Tuxedo may or may not be aggressive towards her. He does chase cats outside, but to me it seems playful but I cannot be sure. Either way orange is scared of him. My tuxedo fights outside with another alpha cat who comes to his territory. But the other cats, he just looks with the same face he looks at a toy lol. So I think there's potential there but the orange is too scared to even give it a shot. 

I have been recommended Feliway and I wanna try it but I have few concerns about it.
1. I saw bunch of posts of ppl saying the diffuser started a fire or melted or something and this is bad. Also, the space is tight because of renovations (and is gonna be for a while) and there really isn't places it could fit since it has to be on the socket and not on extensions (idk if that's correct word) and I would feel very worried about two of them being on 24/7. One in my room and other where the orange cat with one brain cell and two personalities is. I would be especially worried if nobody was home. So that already makes it not possible for it to be on 24/7 and both cat spend lots of time outside the area(my cat), orange cat upstairs where nobody lives because it's not yet built, and my cat outside. So big spaces for both.  And lots of time them not inhaling the pheromones. Is my logic valid? 
2. This made me think of maybe collars being a better option, I saw someone recommended Feliway collar but it seems they don't make collars. I saw alternative brands making collars but are they effective? Which brands would you recommend? I live in EU but can order from US if they have better options.

So, plz advise. I know all about how to introduce cats slowly etc. Not going to force anything, but really wanting them to be able to chill together and share same spaces.

I’m getting pretty stressed out by my current situation so thought I’d ask this in case there are others who faced a similar situation. 

I have two cats, M (6y/o) &amp; R (1 y/o). Both are male and are neutered. M was hospitalized last week for a possible UTI/blockage and is back home now. For the past 4 nights, M was confined in our room so that he can rest peacefully and so that R does not bother/stress him out. M has not gone out of the room within those 4 days, but R has occasionally entered a few times. In the few times he was in the room, he was a bit restless. He would run around, smell M’s items, and use M’s litter box. But he didn’t really do anything to annoy M. Also, this entire week he would CONSTANTLY meow outside of M’s room EVERYDAY/NIGHT. 

So I’m pretty sleep deprived because I’ve been taking care of M. He’s been waking up in the wee hours of the morning to urinate. These past two days, he has been super antsy and has been clawing to get out of the room. 

This morning, I decided to let M into the living room because I didn’t want the confinement to stress him out. It was the first time he’s looked so at peace since he got sick. For a good hour or so, everything was normal and the two slept in the living room. After their nap, R gets WILD.  He kept following M and did not let go of his gaze. He cried and meowed when he’s around M. At first, we thought he was acting like this because he missed M. Later on, he mounts on top of M and starts biting his neck. It happened 2-3 times. We tried to distract R with toys but it didn’t work. M doesn’t have the energy to fight back/assert his dominance, but he was clearly not having it. We immediately separated the two because I don’t want M to be stressed out. I put R in a room which he did NOT like and tried playing with him. The restlessness and meowing continued. 

I’m not sure why this is happening and what to do 😭 I’ve read online that this could be a sign of aggression/dominance which is normal for cats. But the thing is, M had already established dominance when we first brought R in last year. I’m not sure why R is acting anxious/aggressive all of a sudden. The time away they had from each other was about 1.5 weeks and I’m not sure if this had anything to do with it. They usually have a good relationship and don’t fight. I want them to be in the same room without stressing and possibly clawing each other out. I don’t want either to be stressed out.

Her stomach, part of her sides, groin, and tail are significantly shorter than the rest of her and we noticed it didn't start until after we got the new cat.

It's just strange, because she and the new cat get along well enough. They groom each other here and there and play, though he (new cat) is younger and does annoy her at times and tries to play when she doesn't want to, but she usually just up and goes away. 

I know the logical assumption here is. Get rid of the newer cat. But I'd honestly feel terrible doing so, he's such a sweetheart and I'd feel so bad turning him over to a shelter or rescue, especially since he's supposed to be going to my nephew when his mother gets a new place (whenever that is. it was supposed to be months ago.)

Yesterday was hard. He was stressing out from the drive since it was storming, and when I finally got there to give him up, he looked scared and confused. I rushed because I was about to cry in front of everyone and it was extremely hard to do. I came back home to his stuff scattered everywhere, but not him. 

It’s still just as hard today. I’m wondering if I did the right thing, and if I caused him any trauma. Will he remember me, or even miss me after those 2 weeks? I want him to be happy, even if that means completely forgetting me. It broke my heart. 

The foster mom said she was introducing him to a kitten when they got back to her place, which made me happy for him, but I know it’s not permanent and he will be adopted quickly.

Here is some information about the cats I recently lost to the thieves:
About four years ago, I adopted a mixed Magpie cat when the cat was a kitten. Then she gave birth to some kitties before I neutered her. I kept two kitties and gave my friends and relatives the others. So, I used to have three cats living with me: a mother cat named Snowbelle, a 3-year-old male cat named Frawzadam, and a 1-year-old female cat named Yukitsu. All of them had been neutered. They were the most adorable cats I had ever owned. I loved how they interacted as a family. And then two days ago, Frawzadam and Yukitsu disappeared at the same time. I felt something was wrong since the cats never hung out overnight outside of the house like that.

Unfortunately, none of the suggested changes or interventions worked and we are not only still in the same predicament but are now facing additional issues.    

Biscuit escalated to peeing on our things in the basement, so we had to lock both cats out of the basement and guide them to use the litter boxes upstairs. Leopold took it in stride, but biscuit continued to pee on the floor. At first it was at least in the right area, but quickly it moved to wherever in the house she wanted. After a couple days of having her pee on the floor right in front of us, we were resigned and decided we could take no more. But right as we decided, we noticed blood-tinged urine and immediately took her to the vet. They took a sample which came back positive for oxalate crystals. We asked the vet if resolving this would fix her elimination issues and he replied that it might, but it might not. We also asked him if this is something she could have had all along and he said it was possible, but unlikely. He suggested we change her food and give her 3 months. Knowing that we absolutely would not survive 3 months of her peeing all over our house, my partner built her a two-level house with a “litter box area” that we could put in a separate room so that we could better control where she pees (note: her urine being everywhere has also become very distressing to our other cat, so it was imperative we keep it away from him). For the first couple days she did okay. We make sure to visit her and play, put on cat TV, and let her out of the box and into the room (still separate from the rest of the house) for a few hours throughout the day so she can sit at the windows and get a bit more stimuli. During this time, she continued (and still continues) to pee on the floor anytime she’s out of the box.  Recently her demeanor has changed, and she is obviously unhappy. We don’t think she can make it (mental health wise) the 3 months it will likely take (if not more) to help with her bladder crystals. We also learned that she likely has bladder stones and will require imaging for confirmation and then stone removal surgery which we cannot afford. On top of this it is unlikely that her behavioral elimination issues will resolve with the bladder crystals/stones because she’s had the behaviors for so long. We are at a loss. We know we have to give her up because this is not healthy for her or for us. She cannot stay in the box, and we can’t let her loose in the house. She likely needs further medical intervention, but we can’t afford it, and no one wants to take a cat with medical issues AND elimination issues.   

We are looking for options that don’t mean that we’re sending her to die. Somewhere she can go and keep up with the new food to see if it will help without surgery. But also, somewhere she doesn’t have to be locked away and can enjoy more frequent interaction. Somewhere she might be able to learn to use a litter box again, or at least learn to use it more consistently. We’ve done all we can think of, but we’re officially out of resources and it’s heartbreaking.

This is the first cat I've ever owned. While he's generally well-behaved, he's gotten into the habit of licking our wooden flooring (varnished), which makes walking around barefoot or in socks a pretty risky affair.   


We recently took him for his annual physical and he came back with a clean bill of health, so I doubt this is due to a nutritional deficiency. We feed him the amount recommended by most vets and also give him the occasional snack. He drinks plenty of water. We play with him 30 min to an hour a day, so I doubt it's boredom. I wipe the floor with a citrus-scented cleaning solution (which he hates) multiple times a day.

Anyway, my cat is 6 yo and she never purrs. I've googled and applied every advice to maybe inspire my cat to purr, but she just never does. She clearly enjoys the chin and butt scratches but she just doesn't purr.

I will add that I noticed the behavior after she was spayed (hence the AskVet post). But, when I asked the vet about it. They told me that some cats just don't like purring and just express themselves in other ways.

I have an indoor/outdoor cat, about 3 years old, female white DLH. We live in a unique setup that lets me be comfortable allowing her outside (we're well away from the road, the road itself is slow and has little traffic, but at the same time predation is unlikely because there is a lot of activity around the house including things like horses and tractors and dogs and humans at all hours, so wild animals mostly steer clear. Nonetheless, I prefer that Hitty Pitty sleep indoors at night.

When I got Hitty, I already had a big rambunctious dog, and she warmed up to him quickly. He will go running right up to her and screech to a halt and she'll sit there indifferently as he gallops up, mew at him, allow him to sniff her, and then rub up against his legs as he stands there wagging his tail. Sometimes when it's cold she'll sleep right on top of him. So I thought she would warm up to the new puppy right away.

She did not.

They have had a couple of traumatic incidents when he went running up to her, she ran, and he chased - and now she avoids him at all costs. I put her food and water on top of the kitchen cabinets, where there is a big area for her to walk around and look down at the kitchen and living room. I assumed that this would help her warm up to him, but it didn't - over time she stopped coming inside at all. A few times I carried her inside and set her up on the cabinet with her food and water, but she just bolted down and hid under the couch closest to the back door and waited for her chance to bail. I tried Feliway spray and noticed no change.

Recently my vet had me start her on Fluoxetine. We have a routine now where she meets me on the front porch in the evening, I pill her and feed her and hang out with her while she eats, but she won't come in the front door voluntarily, even with the puppy crated. I've tried carrying her in but she just runs under the couch and waits for her chance to bolt out the back door. 

I'm so sad to see her so unhappy. I'm worried about her staying out at night, and I just feel bad as it gets colder (it is not so cold as to be unsafe, she just sleeps in the rafters in the barn, but it's not great.) Honestly, if I had known how hard this would be for her I might have reconsidered getting the puppy, but he is family now too and I'm trying to mend the situation.

What would you do? She's been on the Fluoxetine for about ten days. What I have in mind is to wait another week or so to let the meds start working, and then bring her in and contain her in the spare bedroom so she can hear and smell the puppy without having to face him, for maybe a week or two, and then try bringing her into the rest of the house, maybe with the puppy crated so she can see him but he can't approach her?

My question is, would it be more stressful to take the cat on a 4,000 mile trip (2,000 miles there 2,000 miles back) or to leave her alone for about 15 days? My cat gets stressed around other animals (but tolerates our dog just fine). She would be staying in a house with 2 other cats and 3 dogs (including ours) for about a week. She's lived with them before but never ever came out of my bedroom. We've made the drive before, but she didn't eat, drink or potty for the entire 3 days it took. So I'm wondering if it would be simpler and easier on her if we just left her and got an automatic wifi feeder that times and portions her food, and a gravity fed (5liter) water dispenser. 

On one hand, I'd be stressing her out with the drive/new environment. But on the other hand, she's going to be left alone for an extended period of time which might also stress her out. We don't have any friends to watch her so I feel like it's our only two options. It might sound crazy to leave her for so long, but I'm really not sure how it impacts the cat since they're seemingly solitary creatures. I can't tell if it's an awful idea or not to leave her. 

*Side note, the feeder I've looked into has safety nets where it still works on previous setting when without power or wifi

I would also like to add that she only comes to me for attention, and will only go to someone else if I am not home.

I thought maybe it could have been due to lockdown and she was unable to avoid us, but my family (and especially me) have been really busy lately and she seems to be getting even more friendly. She’s spayed, has no health issues, and is an indoor cat (but sometimes escapes)

She’s always been a bit playful, and would nip at our hands during playtime and lightly scratch but then would lick right after. 

Then, around 3 months ago, she started to hide and jump out and scratch/bite anyone who walked past. 

At the beginning of October, we moved and the aggression got worse. She has begun hissing and growling at us when we pick her up and the scratching and biting when we walk near her has gotten much worse and more painful. We definitely thought the move stressed her out, but she also seemed to get very accustomed to the new place and has various spots she likes to lay at. She has plenty of toys of different materials, but the toys that have stuffing she seems to tear into and destroy. 

When she isn’t being aggressive, she is otherwise a very sweet and sociable cat. At night she sleeps directly on top of or next to us. She greets us when we come in and responds when we call her. She purrs when she’s around us and when we pick her up, when she’s not hissing and growling.

We've tried putting him in the box but he refuses to get inside,  he spreads his paws on the edges so he doesn't touch the litter. We've used every kind of litter, he won't use them. We had a little bit of success with putting puppy pads into the litter box, but it's not a long term solution. And now he doesn't use the pad anymore. He sits down and squats in them, and then suddenly decides the rug is a better place. He is a  stray cat we've known for months but decided to take in. He's been  neutered and has gotten every vaccine and checkup needed, he's very  healthy, with clean bloodwork. He doesn't seem as stressed as before. I  don't know what to do now.

She’s always been a bit playful, and would nip at our hands during playtime and lightly scratch but then would lick right after. 

Then, around 3 months ago, she started to hide and jump out and scratch/bite anyone who walked past. 

At the beginning of October, we moved and the aggression got worse. She has begun hissing and growling at us when we pick her up and the scratching and biting when we walk near her has gotten much worse and more painful. We definitely thought the move stressed her out, but she also seemed to get very accustomed to the new place and has various spots she likes to lay at. She has plenty of toys of different materials, but the toys that have stuffing she seems to tear into and destroy. 

When she isn’t being aggressive, she is otherwise a very sweet and sociable cat. At night she sleeps directly on top of or next to us. She greets us when we come in and responds when we call her. She purrs when she’s around us and when we pick her up, when she’s not hissing and growling.

We had a heavy ceramic fountain but she flooded the room twice by swatting one of the towers so it rotated and dumped water onto the floor instead of into the fountain, and then while cleaning it she jumped onto the counter to knock off a tower, shattering it into a million pieces, so the Catit was the replacement.

I plan on getting a wide bin and putting the Catit fountain in it so _when_ it gets knocked over again, it's at least contained, but this doesn't get to the root of the problem.

I am considering getting a large dog crate to keep a bed/water/litter box in and having them take turns being in the crate when I can't watch them to ensure there is no rough housing play that could get too intense. At least this way they can still see each other and be in the same room...? I'm really reluctant to separate them because they're so close.

Any ideas or tips would be much appreciated, I'm stressed about her recovery in particular!

She then starts to play around with the litter for a second or 2. She does this about 3-4 times a night. The main issue with it is that it’s tracking way more cat litter into the room. When she rushes in, I can hear the cat litter going everywhere (hard wood floors).  I already had one mat down that was helping, but ever since she started going crazy after using the box, it doesn’t seem to help, even after adding a second one. 

Her diet hasn’t changed. Using the same litter as before. Plenty of #1 and #2 in the box.

I’m currently leaving the door open, but maybe a cat door will stop her from rushing into my room and tracking so much? Any other advice? I feed her in the morning before work at about 5am.

I did see that litterbox posts are not allowed unless medical causes have been ruled out. My cat, Pepper, is 14 and has had trouble using the litterbox regularly since she was 3 months old. She has been to the vet regularly in that time, most recently a few weeks ago where they did a urine test. So I feel comfortable saying it's not (primarily) medical.

So Pepper is 14, she was spayed around 6 months, and has never been consistent with a litterbox. When she was a kitten she would pee outside the litterbox, on the carpet. When she was ~2 we moved to California and my dad started letting her outside. Her litterbox issues were greatly reduced at this time as she mostly went outside. When she was 7 I realized how bad indoor/outdoor cats are for the cat &amp; the environment and kept her indoor only. I've done my best to stay on top of enrichment needs.

When she was 9, I went to college and I took her with me. So between then and now, we have moved around frequently. She's a very confident cat and usually is not phased by moving, she settles in quickly and tends to be good about using the box for the first day or two. 

If I'm watching her consistently, I can discourage her from going in other places, but I can't watch her 24/7. Another thing I've done for the past couple years is give her a treat whenever she uses the litterbox. I don't punish her or yell at her when she has accidents. I clean them up ASAP and use Nature's Miracle. But I think she can still smell the spots, because she'll continue to go in that area unless I restrict access to it.

Most recently, I've had to move into a house with 3 other cats. Pepper is restricted to one room because of her accidents and because she doesn't like other cats. The room is relatively small. I'm working, so I can't be here all the time, and more often than not I come home to find pee on the bed. I'm frustrated, I feel like I've tried everything, and I need advice.

She lives in Chesapeake, VA. She has an 8 y/o spayed gray and white medium hair tabby that she's trying to find a new home for.

She also has a 2-3 year old neutered black medium hair that she wants to rehome.

Her family fell on hard times and now she'll only be allowed to keep 2 of her 6 cats (two are staying with her, two are heading to a relative's house, and 2 have no place to go). The black cat I feel will find a home pretty easily. He's young and cute and his only negative quality is that he's a troublemaker with the other cats. I would take him myself if I wasn't at cat capacity.

My aunt says her gray and white ""Hermione"" is sweet when given one-on-one attention and would be best in home with either no other cats or one other cat. Hermione was rescued at 4 weeks old from the middle of a neighborhood street by my aunt, and so she was a bottle baby. I remember her being very sweet as a kitten. As an adult, Hermione is aggressive and very solitary, and all it takes for her to attack you is being in her space (like, standing close to where she sits). She isn't a cat that likes attention unless she initiates it. She's also territorial, and will sometimes walk over to someone to hiss, swat, and bite. It has only gotten worse with more furry additions. She starts fights with other cats in the house and it'd be better for everyone if she found a place to live out her retirement years in peace.

My question is: Are there any rescues that work with aggressive cats like Hermione? Also, if anyone is interested in helping Hermione, they can send me a message. I have pictures.

hi everyone! i’m hoping to get some advice on our situation. for some background my wife and i have 2 female cats (freya &amp; dobby) almost a year apart (both spayed and indoor only), and while not from the same litter, from the same “family” (ie neighborhood cats that had litters. we’re pretty sure they’re most likely aunt/niece). they’ve never really had any issues and they basically have grown up together (i believe we got our second when our oldest freya was around 9 months). 

we are located in southern california in a very small apartment, but we make sure to have two large litter boxes, a fairly tall and large tower and multiple toys and hiding places for them (they like their tents and tunnels). their food bowls are also separated (freya even has a fancy bowl that opens for her microchip, thanks to a gift from my best friend).

they are both current on their health checks (on a wellness plan), and freya even has an upcoming routine check up. we know it could be medical, but we’re thinking it could be stress/aggression that freya is relating dobby to.

here’s why we think this:

within the last year we recently had a new neighbor move in at the end of our apartment block. she got a male kitten, and once he got older (maybe 6-9 months?) we started seeing/hearing him outside. after letting her know multiple times (out of concern- there’s a field nearby with coyotes that frequently come by our residence) she then admitted he will “now be an indoor/outdoor cat”. turns out this girl doesn’t know how to have a cat at all. we rarely see him inside and he now walks past our apartment frequently (we’ve even caught him on our doorbell camera trying to jump into our tomato planters). and seeing as how we have our girls, we’re 99% sure he’s been spraying as well.

we’ve trying shooing him away, tried spraying the “no spray” around our patio, but we’re not sure it’s making a difference. 

when freya has seen him through our screen door before she got very defensive (but not when a stray girl cat had wandered by one day). 

we know it’s most likely territorial, but we’re at our wits end with how to make her feel comfortable and calm. we can’t keep our door closed all the time as it’s finally nice weather here and our girls love watching the hummingbirds outside. 

freya isn’t a mean cat, she’s very sweet. so this “grumpy” phase she’s got going has been very stressful. and dobby doesn’t know why her sister keeps running away from her and hissing and occasionally swatting at her, she just wants to run and play with her like normal.

we have a prescription of gabapentin that we use when she really stressed, we always have the feliway diffuser on and she gets plenty of love. is there anything else we can do?

hi, my cat is 10, spayed female, great health, and shes the only pet i have, and she's used to it being only me and her. she takes a long time to warm up to people i bring around but will usually just sit and watch us from afar, still spending time with us and getting pets occasionally. but, for some reason she really hates my boyfriend, ive never been affectionate with anyone before, that might play into it? i think she feels jealous or replaced, and upset that hes in her space for a week at a time. but she wont stay in the room with us unless shes hungry, and she GROWLS when he pets her sometimes, so i keep them separate, she always has a safe place to hide, but i hate that she doesnt want to be near us and is potentially anxious.  
 my boyfriend is very very quiet and slow and gentle and had cats before, so its not him. i sat with them both the first time they met and he fed her and played with her, and ONCE she slept in the bed with us? but she just hasnt come around. its been months.   
after some research i think i may have introduced them wrong? is there anything i can do to ease her into being around him too? he's coming over this week and moving in soon, and i'd like to work with him and my cat to get them to bond a bit.  
she can be pretty sensitive to change but usually owns whatever situation shes in after a lot of babying, is that what she needs? my boyfriend really loves her and wants her to be happy around him. thank you in advance !

They have different litter boxes, different food bowls. I try to keep them in separate rooms. When they do fight, I break it up. When I see my younger cat going for him, I get in the middle.

For some background,  back in June I moved in with some family members with my 2 year old neutered male Aries. The household already had cats living in it (9 in total not counting my boy), which I knew and was prepared for. Socializing them was a little bumpy in the beginning, but I expected it since Aries was in an entirely different place with different cats, and his sister had just died a couple weeks before from some pretty serious health issues. After about a month or two we were in a good spot with his behavior.

Anyways Aries was doing really well with all the other cats in the house, and I was really proud of him until about a month or so ago when out of nowhere he started attacking one of the other cats Ella on sight. Before this, Aries actually really liked Ella, and she never had any issues with him either. One night I had brought Ella into my room so that my partner could say hi to her before I brought her upstairs to sleep. This wasn't out of the usual, and Aries is used to other cats being in his room, so I didn't really  think anything of it. For some reason it really bothered him this one time and he was growling and even tried jumping up to bat at her. I took her out pretty much immediately because it was really weird behavior for him and put her upstairs with her person. 

After the weird incident in the bedroom we didn't think much of it because we went on a week-long camping trip, and ended up taking Aries with us because he hurt his leg and we needed to monitor him(he's all healed and healthy now after a $900 vet visit lol). After that was over they were cautious but civil around each other, but one day I heard screaming and banging from the other side of the house. I found them both locked on to the other in a ball fighting. I broke it up and put them in their separate rooms but ever since its been on sight with these two and I don't know what to do. Separately they're both the sweetest and most loving cats ever,  but every time they see each other I have to physically pull them apart because they fight so intensely. I'm talking fur flying, puffy tails, things knocked over, they're on tables, cat trees, floors literally any time anywhere they see each other its violence, and every time they fight Ella pees herself and we have to clean them both off. Neither of them are ever injured with the exception of Aries breaking two claws in a fight, but they shouldn't be fighting anyways and I'm worried about what might happen every time I leave the house.

We've been keeping them on opposite sides of the house when possible, or in each others rooms when the other is out, but Ellas human recently had her door taken away for safety issues and the problem is really worrying me. I think it might be important to note that they're the only two tuxedo cats in the house, and Aries isn't the smartest cat in the world by ANY means, and so at first we thought that he was freaking out because he thought his mirror man was out or something, but it's definitely NOT that. Things had gotten better for awhile while we were trying to resocialize them, but with Ella not having her own private space anymore it's been hard and it's happening like once a week. 

I feel so bad for this poor girl she absolutely does not deserve it, and as it's progressed I noticed Ella actually starting some of the fights, and earlier I could barely get Aries off of her because she had grappled onto him so hard and kept biting. I don't know what to do at all and it's so overwhelming for me so I can't even imagine how these cats are feeling...

I've had cats my whole life and have never had this problem before, and the cats don't have this problem with anyone else. They also only fight when they're both on the same level, like if Ella is on the cat tree and Aries is on the floor they're fine, or if one of them is being held or on a table, etc. It's literally only when they're on the same plane but when they are it's on sight and I'm feeling so lost but rehoming either of them is not an option, please help!!

TLDR: two of the ten cats in the house keep beating each other up every time they see them for seemingly no reason other than f*ck it, we ball, and I don't know what to do",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,115986,public,self,Cats started fighting each other HELP,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/ykv99y/cats_started_fighting_each_other_help/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

They are both overweight, they’re an 8/9 on the body condition scale and I believe the ideal range is 4-5. 
One of them has severe asthma, and he doesn’t tolerate an inhaler so we have to have him on a low dose of a steroid long term. This medication puts him at risk for diabetes and weight gain, so the vet encouraged us to start to reduce his food intake to help lower the risk. 

We’re doing the same for our other cat as well. Before they were each eating 1/4 cup of dry food 3 times a day. The vet recommended that we cut one of the meals in half to 1/8 cup, and we’ve also gotten more disciplined about sticking to a schedule using our auto feeder and not giving them food outside of meal times. 

I’m really surprised how much they’re struggling to adjust. It’s been about 5 days and they’re constantly meowing and following us around, especially 2 hours before meal times. Other times they are suddenly extra snuggly and lovey, I think trying to get us to feed them more. 

I keep our bag of cat food on a very tall shelf in a closet, and this morning I woke up to a crinkling sound. I walked out and they somehow opened the closet door, got up on the shelf and knocked the bag down. They were both trying to open it to get food. I have no idea how they did it - it was kind of funny to catch them in the act but also, it broke my heart. Imagining them being hungry enough to go to such an extreme measure really made me question everything and feel like a horrible cat mom.

I’m debating whether I should only cut their middle meal by 1/4 to start with and then try again to go down to half after a few weeks, or if I just need to stay strong until they adjust.

I hoped it would improve with more time to bond, and she does show me a lot that she likes me- purring, bringing me toys, blinking at me, sleeping belly up near me, etc. but no cuddling- she meows all the time and is constantly asking to play with me and no matter how much I play with her it never seems to be enough. I just feel sad because she is so bossy that I feel more lonely when I look at her, even though she is a good cat and doesn't do much wrong really.

Hes both an indoor/outdoor cat he comes and goes as he pleases but we try to keep him in at night. 

Yesterday we got a new grey female tabby cat who is 6.
(Both cats have been fixed for a while) 

Previous owners said she was very cuddly and a strictly indoor cat. So far she spent the entire first day hiding behind the couch and all of today hiding under my bed. Shes slowly adjusting and has eaten and drank but hasnt used to the litter box yet. 

Initially i thought my male cat was going to do well with her because he just seemed curious and like he wanted to smell her. I thought he could benefit from having another cat around since he gets really lonely when everyone is out for work/school.

But today when she finally got comfortable enough to walk around a bit my male cat came over and started making strange noises at her (they were kind of neutral not good or bad) and then gently hit her in the face (didnt swipe but still made contact) and she ran back to hide. 

And then when she left the room i followed her carefully to make sure hed treat her well and he started doing the same thing he does when he stalks his prey and continued making neutral noises, so i shooed him away before he could bother her and when i picked him up he started hissing at me which is unusual for him. 

Considering its only the second night and she hasnt used the litter yet i wanted to make sure he wouldnt bother her while i was sleeping so i closed him in the bathroom with a blanket to lay on and some food/water. He'll get let out by a roommate when he goes off to work in the very early hours of the morning. 


QUESTIONS: 

I need some advice on what to do. 
Is this behavior actually aggressive since he didnt hiss at her just me and didnt swat? 

She isn't starting anything, shes extremely docile and runs away from him when he does this. 

Is it the right thing to do to seperate them for now? 

If it is aggression how can i help them coexist without conflict? 

Also i assume her not using the litter is because of the stress of a new home but if anyone has advice its very appreciated!",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,115927,public,self,cat fighting with new cat,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/ykmjvi/cat_fighting_with_new_cat/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

My cat is a 2-year-old DSH with the thickest undercoat I've ever seen on a shorthair. She sheds like crazy whenever I pet her, which is not a huge deal for me but I really worry about her getting big hairballs when she grooms herself. Since regular brushing with a ""classic"" brush didn't do the trick, I tried a Furminator deshedder, which has done miracles to keep the shedding at bay. She tolerates it very well and even enjoys the grooming sessions with the deshedder, however I've noticed it was giving her dry skin and a bit of dandruff so I decided to stop and try using the Kong Zoom Groom brush. Honestly, it's amazing... it takes care of SO MUCH loose undercoat and it's very delicate on her skin so she's stopped having any dandruff issues however I think my cat hates it. We used to have nice regular grooming sessions where she would come on my lap, get brushed, cuddled and purr up a storm. Now whenever the ZoomGroom's out she doesn't want to be groomed and the only way I can get her to take it is either if I hold her still (very light pressure, so it doesn't take her v long to squirm away, which is the point) or if I start using a different brush and then switch it up in the middle, but that also doesn't last long before she's off my lap. I don't want her to feel uncomfortable or have an unpleasant sensation, at the same time I don't really want to go back to using the Furminator if it's going to give her dandruff.

Anyone have any suggestion on how to proceed? Alternatively, any rec for a deshedder that's also delicate on the skin?

They haven't lived there in a little over a year, but before that, they lived there with a cat for just shy of a year. Today, they took the cat there to introduce it to their parent's new cat. Unfortunately, the new cat became very territorial, as to be expected, and tried to pick a fight with my friend's cat. She just got really scared and hid in a bedroom. My friend put the other cat in the basement so that their cat could calm down, and then went outside. 

Their cat used to spend hours exploring the backyard at this house every day when my friend used to live there with her, but today, because she was afraid of the new cat in the home, she bolted. The neighborhood is a growing new housing development, so the backyard is massive and kind of forested. There is a little mini-forest thing that runs the length of the neighborhood in the backyard, with trees and a creek that runs through the middle. My friend's cat ran deep into that forested brush and they haven't seen her since. They said it looked like she was stopping to sniff things, but wouldn't let my friend get close enough to catch her again.

It's been about nearly 6 hours and she still hasn't come back. My friend tried walking through the brush and calling for her, but after walking the length of 3 yards, they couldn't find her. They have put out wet food, her favorite dry food and treats, and some of her things (a tunnel, scratching boards, toys, litter box, etc.) out in the yard so that it smells more like her territory than the new cat's.

Does anyone have ANY suggestions at all about what else they can do to find their cat? I'm posting this while they sit outside calling for her. This cat means the world to them, and all they want is for her to be safe.

I have self-diagnosed my 1.5 year old scottish fold with pica. What started as minor cable biting and chewing turned into blankets, clothes, plastics, and paintings being bitten and eaten by my cat. I have tried all solutions that I've found online such as

* Switching his diet to more nutritional, organic foods
* Increased play time and stimulation 
* Removing all objects in sight

His most recent episode was him consuming 5 inches of my sweater off of me while I was asleep two nights ago. I've monitored him since and he has shown signs of decreased appetite and energy which I can only assume will lead to an intestinal blockage as this is the not the first thing he's consumed. I'm taking him to the vet today but wanted to gather some input from anyone who may have experienced this. I recently adopted him in August, and from what I understood he did not get along with other cats in his previous home and was originally purchased from a breeder. From day 1 he was biting cables at my home to which I wrote off as kitten behavior, but later this did not seem to be the case. I love him a lot and do not want to think about having to rehome him, but I know this is not something I can handle in the long term (how to cat proof a home, uncertainty of improvement, vet costs). Any input/thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

But then I have noticed a strange pattern. Whenever he goes outside on his own he always returns home in the morning to eat BUT whenever we walk together and I leave him 'in the wild' he does not return. Instead I need to go out the next day (evening) and get him in one of the spots not far from where I left him.

Does anyone have an explanation for this? I am afraid that he thinks that I dumped him and he is not welcome home anymore perhaps? Or am I just anthropomorphizing this cats behavior?

I have self-diagnosed my 1.5 year old scottish fold with pica. What started as minor cable biting and chewing turned into blankets, clothes, plastics, and paintings being bitten and eaten by my cat. I have tried all solutions that I've found online such as

* Switching his diet to more nutritional, organic foods
* Increased play time and stimulation 
* Removing all objects in sight

His most recent episode was him consuming 5 inches of my sweater off of me while I was asleep two nights ago. I've monitored him since and he has shown signs of decreased appetite and energy which I can only assume will lead to an intestinal blockage as this is the not the first thing he's consumed. I'm taking him to the vet today but wanted to gather some input from anyone who may have experienced this. I recently adopted him in August, and from what I understood he did not get along with other cats in his previous home and was originally purchased from a breeder. From day 1 he was biting cables at my home to which I wrote off as kitten behavior, but later this did not seem to be the case. I love him a lot and do not want to think about having to rehome him, but I know this is not something I can handle in the long term (how to cat proof a home, uncertainty of improvement, vet costs). Any input/thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

1- I’ve googled, and word on the internet is that cats can still be spayed while they’re in heat but it’s not advisable. I’m going to ring my vet tomorrow to see what they say, but has anyone gone ahead with this? How was it? I’m concerned if I cancel this appointment I won’t be able to get another one before her next heat cycle (which will be in three weeks?)

2- Should I keep her away from her brother from the same litter? He’s been neutered already and looks a bit embarrassed by her affection for him. Will he try anything on even if he’s been neutered? I kind of don’t want to split them up because they really love each other and she seems to get separation anxiety when she can’t find him round the house. But also don’t want them bonking…

&amp;#x200B;

Though, seemingly randomly, he started to fear my very presence while still giving my SO all the love in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Only things I could consider for him to fear me would be that I've had to use a small squirt gun to stop him from knocking paintings off from above the bed or objects off our nightstand when he's desperately trying to gain affection at 2-4am. This could happen multiple times a night. If he'd just non-stop whine my SO or I would place him in the bathroom with all his food and essentials. Another possibility is I move a lot in my sleep, did I move too much and make him upset?

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to slowly approach him, give him treats, give him cat nip, played with him using a laser pointer.

&amp;#x200B;

However, if I go for pets, he'll slink away in what seems like disgust or avoid it all together. If I even walk in his direction he'll flee to a hole under our bed's foundation that he made(which I intend to seal off)

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, when my SO comes home he comes running and is very talkative to be loved. Let's them hold him. Can even snuggle with him in bed. He'll sleep in the bed all night and when they go to work he'll hide away in his hole.

I’m completely against buying cats and have been looking to adopt a kitten for the past month or so. I have visited 2 rescuers and after spending around 2 hours with each, both their kittens were comfortable with me and now I’m stuck with deciding which kitten to adopt.

While both are girls, one is a 2-month old Arabian Mau that looks like a Bengal, and the other is a 2.5-3 month mix of Turkish Angora and Arabian Mau (rescuer said this kitty will grow into a medium-haired cat, her tail is fluffy already). Both are rescues who were abandoned and are healthy. Personally, breed or looks aren’t really important to me.

I can only adopt 1 kitten. While money isn’t too much of an issue, I can say for sure that we can comfortably afford premium care and resources for 1 kitten. Will definitely neuter and vaccinate.

I just need some help to understand how do I decide on which kitten to adopt. Should their breed or age affect my decision? Any important pointers to consider? Please ask me questions that are important which I may not have mentioned in this post

Most recently, starting about month ago, he's upgraded to waking me up in the middle of the night, typically around 2-4am or will constantly bother me if I happen to wake up on my own (which won't stop until I cave and feed him early). His normal feeding schedule is 2 cans of wet cat food a day- morning at around 7-9am and evening around 4-6pm.

So far I've tried playing with him to get his energy out anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour before bed, covering/removing items that he might chew (and he will typically find another), and giving him dry food through an automatic feeder a few times in the night. His litter box is in my room and there's not enough space in the bathroom to put it in there.

He was well socialized with other cats and dogs before I got him and LOVES to play. The problem is that he had a very very high prey drive and will go too far sometimes once he’s “in the zone”, which can include accidentally scratching me or climbing furniture / curtains appropriately. I’ve been working on this by screaming to let him know when he’s too rough. And have installed cat trees and shelves for him to climb and satisfy his primal urge.

I recently got a second kitten who is much smaller than I anticipated he would be. He is 3.5 months but only about 2 lbs, he was the runt of his litter and has been here about a week and a half. I’ve followed all recommended protocols in introducing the two kittens slowly and they do seem to really like each other and both really want to play / be around each other. They can co-exist in the same room without any hissing or signs of fear, will eat together and fondly sniff each other / share bowls and litter boxes. But due to the huge size difference in the kittens, I’m super afraid the smaller one will get hurt when they’re playing and I’ve been breaking up all of their play very quickly.

When they play, the bigger kitten is always the one holding him down and will repeatedly bite him in different areas and sometimes rabbit kick him. He will hold him down a very long time unless I break them up, which I do.

What can I do to train the bigger one to be more gentle? Am I going to have to wait months for the smaller one to catch up in size? He hasn’t been hurt and doesn’t even cry when the body slams happen, and will even run back to try to play again. So I don’t think the situation is too dire, in the sense there isn’t intentional aggression. But for safety reasons, they can’t be in the same room unsupervised.

Would visiting help her? Or would it make her feel worse? Is there anything I should keep in mind? Should I visit her weekly, or only a few times a month? Should it be after a few weeks so she can get used to my friend's home and their family?

I'm sad I have to give her away, but a family member developed allergies. I just hope I can make it easier for her, she doesn't deserve this. 

Nothing can be done for the allergies (we've tried for the past year), and at this point, it's literally the only thing we can do. I just want to know if I could make it easier for her after she's been given away, specifically with the visiting part.

I love him to death and he is my best friend. 

We’ve been having an issue for about 10 months; he wakes me up between 3 and 5 times per night, every single night. Last night for example:

Bed at 10:30p

He woke me up at:
12:03
1:07
1:52
3:04 (I broke down and fed him here)
5:27

My alarm goes off at 6:30


Now here’s what I’ve tried. This issue is not resolved over weekends when I can spent in excess of 2+ hours of running around playing with him during midafternoon or before bed. Feeding him, likewise right before laying down, has no effect. Leaving my bedroom door open, inviting him to sleep with me, has no effect. 

I attribute the issue primarily to food, and it’s my fault for creating a system where he wakes me up and then I feed him in the middle of the night. His typical feeding schedule is:

1. Usually between 2:00am and 5:00am when I get woken up,

2. 6:00pm when I get home. 

I’ve checked with his vet, who I respect greatly, and she assures me he is eating enough.  

He has multiple options for sleeping which include enclosed spaces with heating pads, ledges off the ground, toys that he can play with, access to a litter box and water (he does not have the ability to graze on food as he only eats wet food). 

Typically my end all solution is shutting a divider door that keeps him in the living room and prevents him from accessing the back of my apartment, which causes me anxiety all day because he spent all night alone, then I go to work and he’s alone all day. 

A popular solution I often hear is getting a second cat, so he has a friend. I can’t help but believe I’m just doing to be doubling my issue as is.

She has been acting normal, eating and drinking well and she is a decent water drinker. No changes in my life or routine. She has still been trotting around, playful and has stuck to her routine. 

I took her to the Vet yesterday to see if she had a UTI. The Vet didn't think it was a UTI, he decided to put her on some Gabapentin for 7 days to see if that would calm her down or ease stress she might be feeling. She does have Conjunctivitis, we started drops yesterday. I guess it's possible that her eye could be stressing her out. I did notice her eye seemed a little irritated early last week but didn't think much of it.

My poor 4-year-old cat and I are struggling badly with our recent move. He has gained several pounds in a month and is displaying new destructive, anxious behaviors like clawing at wood bed frame/biting me to get attention. Overall, I can just tell the move is taking a toll on him. He doesn't snuggle much anymore and his mood seems way off. 

To outline - He was given to me as an outdoor kitten and was able to roam outdoors at my last three residences. 

Unfortunately, due to a variety of factors, I recently had to downsize from a 1 BR apartment where it was relatively safe for him to go outside into a 3 BR apartment with two roommates and a small Corgi where it really is not safe for him to go outside. 

I did the safe-room transition over two weeks and he slowly moved into the rest of the apartment once he got bored of my room. However, all he basically wants to do is eat. Even if I only feed him at the same time each day, he scarfs it all at once, then sits by the bowl and cries, scratches my bed frame or bites me until I refill his food bowl. 

Since I now only have my small bedroom to myself, this means any time I go into my room for any reason he sprints to the food bowl and cries. If I ignore him, he gets frustrated and either takes it out on me or an item he knows will get my attention (bed frame or dresser). 

He has a large climbing and scratching tree that I've jammed into my small room because I knew he'd need a post/item for engagement, but he no longer feels comfortable climbing on it. I'm not sure if this is due to his weight, my room's small space or if he's simply aged out of the toy. 

I've tried feeding him with huntable rat toys that contain food, but they do not fix his expectation that any time I enter my room he should be getting food in his bowl. I haven't found a place to feed him in the shared spaces of the apartment because the Corgi keeps finding a way to eat his food. 

Additionally, while the Corgi is friendly and they're coexisting well, the Corgi injects himself into any playtime (swinging a feather, laser pointer) which discourages my cat from playing. Attempting to lock up the Corgi makes him feel left out, causing him to howl from behind the door and freak out my cat. 

I'm very worried for my cat 😞 I'm a long way from home in a big city with sky-high rents and didn't have any other options for where to live after the end of my long-term relationship. 

I don't want him to become obese but I can't stop him from demanding food and I can't ignore him because he's destroying one of the few valuable things I own in my bed frame. I also don't want to give him away cause he's my lil partna and he's been one of the few steady aspects of my life over the last few years.",True,False,False,CatAdvice,t5_2sn56,115830,public,self,cat struggling with recent housing change 😞,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/yk1sk5/cat_struggling_with_recent_housing_change/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

But what I'm wondering is if they'll forget me after that long. I've heard cats forget their old owners in about a week and I'll be gone for almost two. If they will, is there anything I can do to stop that from happening?

I feed him bits of turkey, egg or some fish I didn’t finish, but tbh, I’m not interested in buying cat food as a regular household supply. He used to come by sporadically, and I was happy to share our leftovers. The only thing is, it looks like he really loves our house now because he’s sleeping on our porch at night and throughout the day.

We can’t house him, and the shelters are totally full and will not take him. He also doesn’t let me pet him. I’m sure with a lot of patience he could belong to someone, he’s just been outdoors for so long.

Winter is coming but we do live in Austin, TX, so right now temps are manageable. I’m not sure what type of a shelter I can make that wouldn’t attract roaches (we have a lot of em here).

We got a kitten last Friday and she hid under the bed for the first 3 days before suddenly turning into a love bug and is all over us when I come in there to visit. She still hides when she gets spooked but overall she's out and about in the room. I love it but only one problem, my mom works in that room and when she's in there the kitten absolutely HAS to be on the desk demanding pets. 

She tried moving her cat tree close for her to sit next to her but nope straight onto her desk. She tried picking her legs up so the kitten can't climb up them, she just jumps up. Tried repeatedly just putting her back on the ground to no avail. She'd be fine with her in her lap but she doesn't want to stay there she wants to walk back and forth on the desk for pets. She's too small to give free reign of the house, and it'd be a bit too scary for her since her safe room in that bedroom and when my mom works it has to be closed.

We've been working on introductions the past few days to the current cat. Mostly they consist of the kitten ignoring current cat and wondering or purring loud af and trying to get close to current cat. Current cat just watches from afar, doesn't hiss or smack or arch but will walk away when she comes near.

Tonight we resorted to letting the current cat into the room to distract the kitten so my mom could get work done. I would take her out into the living room and watch her but I've got two dogs and haven't done the introductions much with them, they've done visual introductions but haven't gotten anywhere near where she is introduction wise with current cat.

She will be snuggled up in my lap and then leap at my face claws out. Sometimes I catch her eye right before she does it and her face looks focused, maybe playful? There's no growling or hissing. She's been doing this since I got her as a kitten. I've tried different strategies. At first, I thought it would happen because I had stopped petting her and she wanted to get my attention. To address that, if she crawled into my lap, I would pet her and then set her down once I was done. But then, it started also happening when I was petting her. So, I thought maybe she's getting overstimulated by petting. So, I wouldn't pet her when she was in my lap. But nothing has worked except just not allowing her to get into my lap, which seems sad because other than this one thing, she loves to cuddle and is very snuggly. She is always seeking out my lap. But...today, she scratched my face and drew a little blood for the first time and I'm just beside myself trying to figure this out.

I adopted my kitten Al, at 10 weeks old from a friend, he was taken from his litter too early somewhere between 2-5 weeks old, and has never lived with a cat until now. When I got him 4 weeks ago, he was extremely playful and comfortable with me from the start, comes up to me for cuddles and is very sweet when he is tuckered out. When he is full of energy he would always run around and stalk me and bite my hand, and when I researched why, I found out he might need a friend. I chose to adopt a 10 month old female kitten who was raised perfectly fine with other cats. They got along and were able to eat in the same room within 3 days and slept next to each other being completely comfortable. 

Al always wants to play with her and tackle and do all the fun kitten activities he missed out on, but my new female cat does not want to play very often. He will pounce on her out of nowhere and keep trying to play with her and she will growl and hiss and gently fight back. She will eventually try to run away but he doesn’t let her. She gets even louder with the hissing and growling and that’s when I put Al into his carrier. I’m never worried about them hurting each other, they never have drawn blood, fur, and never made that traditional cat fight sound. Based on their body language, the female cat generally wants nothing to do with it, but he thinks it is all play. 
How do I get this to stop? Both are fixed. He won’t play with me or toys anymore. I just want my female cat to not have to be so annoyed all the time. They both are so sweet when calmed down. If Al doesn’t stop I will probably rehome him for another home that fits his temperament, which is worst case scenario.

1) There is a typhoon going on and the wind sounds were pretty loud, so kitty might be scared? But she wasn’t looking out of the window, not hiding or displaying fearful body language.

2) We tried a new wet food 2 days ago - Wellness pate. Kitty has been eating brands mainly of Ziwipeak and Feline Natural with minimal ingredients. Wellness isn’t bad but there are more addictives and supplements in the ingredients. Could this cause kitty to act weird, like how food addictives make kids hyperactive?

[Here's a picture of them!](https://i.imgur.com/11NQ8og.jpeg)  
Back in March Crona was diagnosed with diabetes and we went through the process of monitoring his blood glucose levels over several months. Our vet recommended a specific canned wet food diet for him that he's been eating for 8 months now. He said Crona has to eat the entire can in one sitting, one in the morning, and one in the evening, and then be administered 2 units of insulin. (After doing some research it sounds like cats have small stomachs and tend to eat a little at a time? It seems odd our vets advice is to make him eat it all at once.) Feeding him has become, to put it mildly, incredibly frustrating and time consuming for both of us.  


Zero and Crona had been free fed for 7 years but we switched to set meal times when our vet recommended it (before the diagnosis, they were both a little heavy). It was an adjustment met with lots of screaming and whining but they eventually got used to it. At the time they were both eating Purina Beyond Indoor cat food so it was easy enough to fill their bowls and walk away; they'd finish their food eventually. After Crona's diagnosis and switching him to the canned food we realized that if we left the room, he would eat 1/4 of the food and walk away to lounge somewhere else. It would take hours for him to go back and finish it, which wasn't compatible with what the vet told us. One can of food, 2 units of insulin. Sometimes we would leave and walk back into the kitchen to see Crona eating from Zero's bowl, so we couldn't leave Crona in the kitchen with it out. One of us literally has to stand next to Crona for the entire time he eats, encouraging him and directing him back when he tries to walk away. If we're lucky, this will take 25 minutes with only minor encouragement. Most days it's more like 45 minutes. Some days it's over an hour and a half, where he'll eat half and sit there staring off into space, and after trying to motivate him to eat he'll just plop on the ground onto his side. We have to do this twice a day so on an especially bad day, it's three hours of trying to get Crona to eat. We love him, but it's become a massive burden.  


So I want to ask if anyone else has a diabetic cat they've had a similar experience with and if they have any advice on how to deal with this. Some days we barely have time for any self care, and with both of us working full time, this creates a lot of welled up stress.
