1,CatAdvice,Is it cruel to let a cat die at home?,"My bf and I have a cat that we believe is currently dying. His decline has been severe and VERY sudden, in the past 3 days he went from seeming a little bit off to barely breathing. We went to the vet yesterday and we were told that they didn't know what was wrong but it didn't look good. The best they could do would be running $300 of tests just to figure out where to start and even then we were warned that it likely wouldn't be treatable given his symptoms. One of us was just laid off unexpectedly and the last of our cash went to the exam/meds he got yesterday. The cheapest euthanasia price I've found calling around is still $100 we don't have. The cat belongs to my bf who is absolutely devastated and I'm trying to figure out what to do. I've never had a cat before him and my head is still spinning, this whole thing came out of nowhere and I can't understand how things went downhill so fast. We think the cat is 10-12 but don't know for sure since he was a rescue. Right now we've made him as comfortable as possible but I don't know if he's in pain. His heart rate is so low, only 68bpm and his breathing is fast and shallow. I'm heartbroken and don't know what to do or how to help him. Any kindness or advice you all have would go a very long way for us right now",throwawayjdgiuehwkf,2022-12-02,06:00:32,2022,12,2,6,0,Friday

1,CatAdvice,We may have found our solution,"This might be a bit unusual but we ended up crating our cat. One of our cats we've had for a couple of years, since kittenhood. He came to us from a rescue and generally has a lot of obsessive and anxiety driven behaviours due to what he went through before he came home to us. 
We've been pulling our hair out trying to help him while seeing our house getting destroyed around us. He didn't want to be alone but didn't want to be picked up. He destroyed sections of the carpet, the walls, attacked the other cats and was a right devil, especially at night. He can't stand closed doors and started opening them to wreak havoc in every room he could. 
He's been to the vet, we've bought feliway diffusers, cat trees, toys galore, tried natural drops like pet rescue remedy and played with him whenever we were home but nothing was working.
We were stressed to the point of tears and had made up our minds to rehome him when I found our dogs old crate in the garage. It's big enough for a large breed dog and he used to get in and out of it before we packed it away.
I pulled it out, gave it a clean and the whole time our cat was watching me. I grabbed his bed, his blanket and some of his favorite toys to put in there and he just walked right in. I left the door open so he could walk in and out as he pleased for the rest of the afternoon. Dinner time came and usually he's obsessed with running around to everyone's food or trying to get through the door while he's being fed separately so I put his bowl in the crate and shut the door while he ate. No yowling, no protesting and when he was done, he got in his bed and went to sleep. So we left him there while we watched a movie and he just kept sleeping. 
We trialled him in there overnight and I checked on him a few times throughout the night and he was still calm, mostly sleeping or playing with his toy mouse. 
Come morning, he's still chill when my alarm goes off. I open the door, he wanders down to the litterbox and from then on he's been a calmer cat.
He's got his routine, where he'll eat breakfast and dinner in there, come out for cuddles and some playtime after dinner and goes to bed about 9.30pm. He waits patiently in the morning and wanders out when I open the door. He is much calmer throughout the day with the other cats and we've not seen any new destruction happening.
He is not in there 24/7, only overnight, and he seems to benefit from having a space that is purely his own that the other cats are not allowed in. He seems able to fully relax in there and has become much cuddlier and calmer and it feels like the light at the end of the tunnel.",MumofThreeFurBabies,2022-12-02,02:54:04,2022,12,2,2,54,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Seeking advice in regards to my kittens that love to jump on counter tops/tables,"I feel at a loss right now, my partner is wanting to rehome our kittens and as much as I don’t want to if we can’t put an end to this behavior I won’t have a choice. For a little backstory, we have two bonded brothers that we adopted at two months old. They are about 10 months old now, and super rambunctious and love to chase each other around all day. My partner doesn’t mind them, but he finds it absolutely repulsive when they climb on our counter tops and tables. I understand his frustration, it’s not a great habit they have but no matter what we do they don’t stop. We clean and sanitize the stove and countertops frequently but they will still jump on them so long as our backs are turned to them and sometimes they’ll even do it in front of our faces. They know they’re not supposed to be on them, the second we catch eyes with them they jump off and run away. We’ve tried everything. Tin foil, tape, compressed air, spraying bottles, nothing works. The last straw was just a few days ago, somehow they managed to climb onto our floating shelves in the kitchen and knock over glass containers and it caused them to shatter and it made a mess. My partner works from home so it was extremely disruptive and he had to take time out of his work day to clean it up. Again, I don’t want to rehome them, I would never wish that on any pet, but my partner is getting increasingly frustrated regarding this and unfortunately he’s not as sympathetic as I am. I’ve considered the possibility that maybe they will be better off in someone else’s home but I don’t know. I’ve had many cats growing up but i’ve never had to deal with behavior this bad. I’ve also consider getting them a cat tree but my partner doesn’t think that will do much. Any advice? What do you guys think?",kittytearz,2022-12-02,01:51:05,2022,12,2,1,51,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Exploring leading to destructive and potentially lethal consequences,"My girlfriend and I got a kitten almost 3 months ago, he's now almost 9 months. When he arrived in our home, he did some pretty innocent exploring, testing the waters, and we quickly noticed what we needed to watch for with him. Plant and cable chewing were big ones.

So after some cable wrapping and hiding, as well as plant reorganization and some anti-chew spray, as well as getting him some cat grass, it's stopped for the most part. 

However he seems to be getting into moods (not zoomies, he's adjusted well to our 2-3 play sessions per day) where he will jump onto areas we've tried to barricade, or make inaccessible, for reasons of wires that can't be moved any more, or plants that could make him sick. A loud clap and a firm ""no"" used to be enough, but now he almost just gives me a look of ""that's nice, dad"" and carries on, so we gradually progress. we did get one of those motion air sprayers to guard a hub of wires and my girlfriend exotic (and toxic...) plant, which works very well, but I also don't have $400 to buy enough to create a perimeter around everything lol. The big no areas will get him a clap and ""no"", then a quick spray from the bottle, and a final offence gets him a timeout (this is after we noticed it wouldn't matter how many times we tell him to stop, so we went from 4 strikes, to just those 3 steps). His timeout room is our spare bathroom with his second litter box, toys, water and bed, with nothing that can get him into trouble, he is exiled there for 15 minutes. The timeout seems to calm him down, as he generally goes to him toys, curls up with us on the couch, or back to his cat tree to watch the outside.

Are we going about this the right way? We've tried to foil on the floor around areas he's not allowed in, but I guess he's one out of 100 cats that doesn't mind tin foil... Lucky me right? Cat blocker spray works for 2 days, but ideally I'd like a solution that teaches him long term to not go there. It's gradually bothering us, as he's accidentally knocked over a plant, a lamp, and some decorations (we know it's accidentally as it's just him trying to squeeze into small spaces, or get by stuff, not pawing things off shelves).

Any suggestions on this would be really appreciated",C0disafish,2022-12-02,01:22:19,2022,12,2,1,22,Friday

1,CatAdvice,do I have to get rid of my cat? (urination),"I am going insane. Okay so my cat pees in the same place in my kitchen every day -- I use enzyme cleaner, I've put him on medication, I have used orange extract, I've taken him to the vet (they say it's behavioural), I've moved the litter box to the spot. This started two months ago -- I had a friend visit for a couple days, but that was months ago &amp; he's still urinating daily. He's used the same litter and same boxes since I got him, and he had issues with inappropriate urination when I first got him, but he's been ok for two years until now. Honestly, I'm going absolutely mad. He's had a handful of days in the last few months that he's peed in his box, but beyond that it's the kitchen every day. I just put him in the room with his box for a few hours after he peed in the kitchen, and upon release, he peed in the kitchen again. It's not spray, it's like pee pee.

1,CatAdvice,Newly adopted stray cat food obsession,"I recently adopted a stray cat. She’s about ~1 year of age (not spayed yet, but the appointment is coming up). She is - understandably - EXTREMELY food obsessed. She gets into my trash can that has a lid, runs at food I’m eating constantly, licks everywhere food has been (sink, counters) even though I clean up and don’t leave any food or utensils laying out. I watch her &amp; play with her for many hours of the day, but I can’t keep an eagle-eye on her 24/7.

Is this something she’ll grow out of with time, once she realizes I do feed her routinely? Do you have any advice for dealing with it right now? I don’t know the best way to discipline a cat.",pancakesandwich27,2022-12-01,23:18:55,2022,12,1,23,18,Thursday
1,CatAdvice,I traveled with my six-month old kitten and it was wonderful,"Hey all. Traveling with cats is very fraught, and something I thought about for months. Your situation and cat(s) are of course different, but I want to share my experience in case it is helpful.

I have a single, six month spayed kitten (context: she was found at three months old on the street by herself. The shelter was full, so they asked me to foster her. I fostered her for 3.5 weeks, and fell in love. Due to my apartment size and costs, I cannot swing another cat, and she was not bonded to any. I adopted her because she is incredibly independent, friendly, and loving. I play with her at least 1-2 hours a day and am deeply committed to her well-belong).

Anyway. Before I adopted her, I booked a trip for 12 days for Thanksgiving. At first I thought I would hire a pet sitter from a certified/bonded company to visit her twice a day. I arranged for the pet sitter to meet her and visit her on another occasion when I was out for 12 hours.. But the more time went on, the more anxious and uncomfortable I grew leaving her alone for this long. I work from home and spend most days with her. I couldn’t imagine going from zero days apart to twelve.

While traveling might be uncomfortable, the level of anxiety I was feeling about leaving her meant that I would be unable to enjoy my trip to see my family if I were constantly worried about her. I have PetCams in every room, and still, the uncertainty was too much for me to quell.

Before making the decision, I took her to the vet who said she is 100% able to fly health-wise. He said it’s a “headache” to travel with pets, but we don’t know how she’d behave if left mostly alone that long, and suggested I don’t give her free reign of the house. He also said we don’t know how she’d behave in a new environment! There are a lot of objective facts, circumstances, and emotions that factored into my decision to bring her (eg, she never cries in the carrier when we go for a car ride). 

The vet suggested Composure Pro chews, which we tested beforehand, and she wouldn’t eat. I got a Pupteck harness and practiced putting it on and letting her wear it around the house a few times beginning several weeks beforehand. I also set up an AirTag to put on the harness for additional peace of mind. Her Sherpa medium sized, airline-approved carrier stays out where she can see it 24/7, and I sprayed it (and my car) with Feliway, and put in an old t-shirt and some of her toys. 

On my end, I made sure to book the $125/each way pet in cabin ticket beforehand. I also got approved for TSA Pre-Check, which was the best $78 I ever spent. It took literally two seconds to go through TSA, and I got to the airport with plenty of time to ask for a private screening room, which took all of 1 minute. I also flew on non-peak days (Thursday and Tuesday). 

At the destination we were visiting, my parents generously set up a cat hammock, beautiful cat tree, her same water fountain, scratching post, litter box, and toys. The space we’d be staying in is two bedrooms with a bathroom in between. This would be her safe space. In this space, there is plenty of room for her to run around, hide, and a large window with awesome Cat TV and plenty of Floridian lizards to watch all day…. I also plugged in a Feliway diffuser.

Going there, we found a quiet spot in the airport and she slept until it was time to board. I will say, being in line to board stressed her out, but when I pivoted the carrier to face me (instead of all the people), she calmed down. We had a window seat, which was wonderful - she essentially faced the wall, and stuck her nose against my feet (she loves the smell of feet, haha), and slept the entire way. I’d check on her every once in a while by saying her name, and she’d meow back.

When we got to the new location, she went under the bed for a few hours. I lifted up the bed skirt to check on her and she stretched out her paw and came out, sniffing around with her belly low to the ground. She slept on the bed next to me the first night, which she never does at home… The next day, she was exploring, playing, eating, using the litter box, and posting up in her cat tree to stare out the window. She got spooked by some new sounds the first few days, but eventually got used to it. 

After about five days, we let her roam supervised through the rest of the house for a bit. There is a puppy that stayed separated by a baby gate. They got to the point where they were sniffing each others’ noses through the gate!

Our trip home was also smooth. The minute we got home, she demanded a rigorous play session! While we played on the trip, she wasn’t sprinting around as much. Back home, her play mojo came out in full throttle immediately!

TLDR: I traveled with my kitten to ensure she received the level of care and attention she is used to on a daily basis. Without any medication, she slept on the plane, and was sniffing around the new room a couple hours after arriving. In the new location, she was enthralled with her new Cat TV and had a very comfortable setup with all of her same items from home: the space was sufficiently catified! I know people say cats are better off at home, but given that she is still young and I was anxious about leaving her for 12 days for the first time, I wanted to try it out and see how adaptable she is. To me, the answer is very!

1,CatAdvice,"Cat bringing in rodents...constantly. Dead, dying and living mice everywhere.","Hi all. I've got a 2 year old male cat, neutered, GPS tracked, fed dry food and wet Whiskas twice a day at 8am/8pm roughly. 

He's got a catflap that's always unlocked but he usually goes out only after dark, and returns at 5-6am.

He's always been a hunter, bringing home a dead mouse about once or twice a week but lately it's really ramped up, and he's stopped killing them! Last night I got a dead one at 6pm, a live one about an hour later which I caught after much difficulty and then another live vole at 11pm which is still at large. It usually about 2 or 3 a night now, his record is 5.

The night before that he literally stuck his head through the catflap at 10pm, released a live mouse and buggered off. That mouse is now somewhere in the walls. And last week, he put the back half of a mouse in the side pocket of my backpack, and then the day after I found a half dead chewed vole in my bag.

I can usually tell when he's got something as he wakes me up making a weird growling sound whilst holding the rodent, it happens at all hours. 

I live on a small boat so when he's kept inside, he gets bitey, angry, loses all affection and doesn't want to play or anything. 

Any suggestions? Different cat food? Feeding times? I don't think I can deal with many more mice sharing my home!",peanutstring,2022-12-01,19:23:41,2022,12,1,19,23,Thursday
1,CatAdvice,Cat grief questions for 1st time cat mama,"First time cat owner here, always had a dog. Also the first time I've had more than 1 pet at a given time, so I've never experienced a pet grieving another. So I had 3 cats &amp; a dog, Princess(2f cat) hangs out more with Serena(11f dog), and Oscar(3m cat) &amp; Kittah(4m cat) were inseparable, brothers practically, cuddled when they slept, played together exclusively, etc. Typically Kittah was super clingy with me and loved attention/people/very social little man, Oscar on the other hand was very independent/aloof, and would ignore everyone but his papa, my bf, and wouldnt come out for guests until Kittah decided they were cool. Kittah just passed unexpectedly 2½ weeks ago and it broke our hearts, and at first Oscar was uncharacteristically cuddly with me, let me/asked me to pick him up(usually he forbids it), just being generally more lovey/vocal, and then almost on the dot 2 weeks after Kittah passed, Oscar is suddenly very aggressive and has been clawing up my hands/legs every other time I walk in the room, but hasn't been doing so to the girls that I've noticed, and he hasn't taken any swipes at my bf that I know of. I guess I'm just concerned if this is part of his grief? Will it ease as time passes? We're trying to spend more time with all 3 since Kittah's passing in hopes it'll help them &amp; us cope together but I'm not sure if Oscar needs space, more cuddles, or if something worse is wrong. I'm also concerned about how they'll react later on when Serena leaves us, as she's getting up there in age and showing it.

1,CatAdvice,Does anyone else’s cat try to step on there baby?,"I love our cat he’s 6 years old, neutered, orange, and quite a chonky boy. He’s a great boy but sometimes he can be an ass, like when he tries to step on my 8 week old baby.

He’s not mean, doesn’t hiss, growl, scratch, bite, or anything towards her the most he’s done is rub is face against her head trying to get pets and lick her hair but that’s it.

1,CatAdvice,my kitten has INSANE zoomies at night,"I just adopted my baby a few days ago. He’s a five month year old kitten that’s super affectionate and sweet.

The only time he becomes an issue is late at night. He has zoomies for about 2 hours straight and gets play aggressive (will bite at my hands and feet).

I bought him a ton of toys to try my best to keep him away from my hands and feet and try my best to tire him out throughout the day but he still does this from 10:45 pm to 12:45 am when i’m trying to sleep.

We thought maybe because it’s colder, the food smell less temping at room temperature. So we tried heating it a bit more but the cat does not appreciate.

She still loves kibble and is sleeping and playing normally. It’s just the eating part that’s making me frustrated, since we tried so hard to find some wet food that she liked!",CauseSpecialist9576,2022-12-01,16:05:55,2022,12,1,16,5,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,Am I cruel?,"I just got a new kitten who is amazing and I love her. Except she doesn’t sleep at night. For the past 2 weeks I didn’t sleep and started breaking down. 3 hours sleep max. I tried everything. She’s also deaf and is much more loud than a normal cat. 

Fast forward three days ago I started putting her in a completely separate unit that I have access to. (I’m a property manager in an apt complex.) At first it was from 1AM-5AM. But tonight I just put her in there at 10PM and hope to sleep until 6AM uninterrupted. 

I put a cat tower, toys, litter box, food…I also have automatic toys going (a laser, as of yesterday, that immediately catches her attention.) 

She’s 3.5 months old, and I’m home with her basically all day. I just feel guilty leaving her by herself …but felt like I was about to die from lack of sleep.

English it's not my first language, apologies in advance for any mistakes, also I am in my phone in case of formatting issues. 
Me and my boyfriend have a year old calico, we are collegue students and we are each returning home for the holidays, my family lives much farther than his (around 30 hours of driving versus 8 hours), so it wouldn't make any sense for me to take her in a plane and also my family has another cat and that could cause trouble. 
My boyfriend can take her with him. Should he do that or should we hire a catsitter to come and take care and see her for a few hours? We have no friends that can take her.
I have been reading about this and I've seen that spending so much time only seeing a stranger a few hours a day may change her personality and traumatize her, but I've also read that travelling and a new place it's traumatizing even with a familiar face taking care of her.

1,CatAdvice,My cat only ever wants to sit in her tower hammock and always runs away when we try to snuggle with her.,"We found our kitten at 3 weeks old back in May. She’s a calico, bottle fed and we had to stimulate her to go to the bathroom. She’s an only kitten, but we’re going to adopt another kitten soon.  

Up until about a month to two months ago, she would always sleep in bed with us, sleep on our chests, snuggle with us on the couch if we had the right blanket. I gave her a bath a few weeks ago and now she never stays if we pick her up out of the tower to come sit with us.  

She loves to hunt us (sneak up on us).. and I think part of her thinks that if she runs away, we’ll start playing hunt with her (we make eye contact with her, and then hide.. then she’ll slowly start creeping forward every time we hide.. then she jumps up at us!)

I was looking for some advice. I started staying at my girlfriend’s apartment more often now and she has an 8 year old cat. He’s a super affectionate cat and is generally well behaved but he doesn’t seem to want to leave us alone at night. We’ve tried leaving the bedroom door open but when we do he just comes in at all hours and gets in our faces when we’re trying to sleep. My girlfriend mentioned that he does not do this when I am not there. When we do close the door he will come to the door and scratch at it and meow super loudly. We recently purchased a mat that has a rough edge so he will be less likely to want to stand in front of the door for too long but this only seems to keep him at bay for some parts of the night.

1,CatAdvice,Aggressive tortie hurting our other cat,"Hi guys,

My partner and I adopted a second cat almost a year ago. Our first cat is 2 years old and very welcoming. Our second cat is a year younger and a tortoiseshell with some definite tortitude.
As time has gone by we have noticed her personality settle in. They can coexist but she is very aggressive. So even though they are past their transitional phase by far and can technically live and sleep and eat in the same space without hissing etc, her aggression remains. She is extremely high energy and goes through regular zoomies and they usually play at that time. But she is too easily stimulated even with us, so if you touch any of her sensitive zones she will attack you. At the same time she will bully our other cat out of all spots in the house and randomly hurt him by biting him in the butt, the tail or the back.  He does not fight back usually but it’s starting to hurt him.  This is all very disturbing and despite only positive encouragement and separation attempts it hasn’t changed.  My partner is pretty upset now.  I would be very sad to have to somehow come to the conclusion she needs to be rehomed.  Right now all I can think of is adding more things to the house where she can let out her energy, like a cat wheel etc.  any advice would be so much appreciated :(",beheritsurprise,2022-12-01,09:14:14,2022,12,1,9,14,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,How to deal with jealous cats??,"Hello! I have never posted before so please excuse any issues.

I have two cats, Benji (4) and Luigi (1ish). Benji arrived last September. He has always been very clingy and attentive. He follows me around, will cry if I shut the bathroom door etc. He loves me a lot and is my little shadow.

Luigi was originally a foster, but he got along great with Benji and I felt really helped him feel less anxious. I have had him since early June. He is very cuddly, loves to be as close to you as possible. Unlike Benji he isn’t always so loving. He is independent and comes to me when he wants it.

Recently, I’ve noticed Benji being more aggressive with Luigi. Typically Benji will let him know if he’s being annoying and will hiss to let him know to leave him alone. 

For the last few weeks, if Benji sees Luigi laying with me or whatnot he gets upset. The other day Benji jumped and hissed at him as he was laying on me. This morning I woke up and Luigi was again beside me, snuggled up on my side. As soon as Benji realized he ran at him. Luigi immediately got up and ran.

There hasn’t been any major changes. We moved in August but they have plenty of space to play.  I’m not sure what I can do to stop this. I obviously love them both and want to give them what they need but I have never seen Benji get angry like he has been.

1,CatAdvice,My cat (tortie female) is having issues cleaning herself,"Hello! I have a tortie, whose getting on the older side. She’s very fluffy and furry, especially on her behind. In the past year, she’s gotten two UTIs. Luckily the get fixed that up, but it’s expensive, and I notice she is having issues cleaning her behind. Sometimes I’ll just use a wet paper towel and help clean it for her, which I hope is ok? (She lets me and looks relieved after usually)

Is there anything I can do to help clean her behind? She used to be able to do it fine but since she’s gotten older she’s had issues cleaning it herself, leading to utis when I sadly didn’t pay as close attention as I should have. I talked to the vet and we changed her litter, which might have been causing it. But is there anything at home that can help with cleaning her behind? I was going to try and cut the hair around her behind so it’s easier to clean since she had a lot of fur, but she moves around a lot and I don’t want to accidentally hurt her.

1,CatAdvice,Adopting a cat who’s being rehomed,"I’m part of a local Facebook mom’s group, and this morning a fellow mom posted about rehoming a cat due to her being pregnant and it being too much. She mentioned her kids don’t change the litter box and she’s moving and can’t take the cat with her. I’ve been wanting to adopt a cat for the over a year now. My kids love cats and they play with the wild ones outside (yeah I know, not the best idea, but I can’t keep them away) We even had a couple cats come inside our home, and stay for a while. I’ve never owned a pet but something tells me that if I bring this cat home, he will miss the previous owner and therefore act up with us. Is it a good idea to adopt a cat who’s being rehomed for such reasons? In the pictures he looks loved and comfortable, and I understand how being pregnant the litter and smell can be a lot. And how would I even bring this cat home? Won’t he feel weird being put in a cage and brought in a new home he never saw before?",crvmom99,2022-12-01,02:59:43,2022,12,1,2,59,Thursday
1,CatAdvice,Cat Is Overly Needy/Attention Seeking,"Adopted a nine year old from the shelter back in July.  Great cat, love her to death.  Very friendly and very well behaved.  Doesn't get on counters/tables, doesn't claw furniture.

My issue is, she is *overly* needy.  I thought as the months went by since her adoption she would start to get a little better, but she's actually gotten worse.  

I WFH and it is a non-stop fight all day long to stop her from sitting on my desk in front of my screen.  Eight hours, all day long.  I got her a cat tower and put it directly next to my desk.  She will lay in it maybe 20% of the time.  

I will pick her up from my desk, put her on the tower, and literally the second I let go she is trying to walk back on the desk.  We will repeat this 6-10 times, before she finally hisses and jumps to the floor.  I then get about a fifteen minute break before the whole process repeats itself.  For eight fucking hours.  

I make sure to play with her for 20-30 minutes before I start work, again in the middle of the day, and again after work.  

She will *not* self play or entertain herself in any way shape or form.  I have about ten different types of toys she can interact with on her own, and she won't touch a single one.  I have a window perch for her looking into the front yard, she refuses to sit in it (I've never seen her look out any window in the house for the five months I've had her).  

She is affecting my sleep, waking me up 3-5 times per night licking my face and meowing.  

If she is not sleeping herself (and she sleeps way less than most cats) she demanding my attention 100% of the time.  


FYI she's had *two* full work ups at the vet since I got her, she is not sick in anyway.  


Despite my complaining here, I absolutely *do* love her to death, but she is also slowly driving me crazy.  

Does anyone have any advice?",amphetaminesfailure,2022-12-01,02:52:18,2022,12,1,2,52,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,Tomcat crying and yowling all the time. Literally.,"Hello everyone! I made a post recently about adopting a Tomcat from the streets. Midnight is his adoption name.

Here's a bit of back story on my dear Midnight boy:

He's a 1 yo cat that one of the tennants in my appartment complex adopted, let out and never really brought back in. He's not entirely feral as he was born in a house (one of his sister is living with a tennant who knew the person caring for Mama and her litter) but he obviously has some ""feral habits"". The introduction with my in home boys went well (this is what my first post about him was but I was under an other username bc too lazy to match pc and phone, anyway) and they're all living well together although his ""feral habits"" can sometimes trigger one of them. They don't fight much but a little disagreement happens every once in a while. 

On to the problem:

Since I've had him, I'm not opening the windows as much for him to smell all the smell from the great outdoors and I think it might be the problem. I have a harness and walk him when I can and the weather allows it, when I don't have time to do so, I harness him up and tie his leash to the indoor doorknob and let him out on the balcony until he asks to be let in again. I had the idea to do so because he satrted meowing and yowling all the time for no apparent reason. Some times he'll even be doing that meowing and yowling while he drinks at the fountain, which is quite funny to hear his ""MleowmlmlmlleoooOOww!!"" and stuff but I'm getting worried.

Letting him outside and walking him around the block doesn't seem to fix his constant crying, no matter how much attention I give him or how many times I let him out during the day. The only time he's being quiet is when he is touching me or sleeping in my general vincinity. Then he'll mrrp, trill, purr and ask for pets. As soon as he gets up and walks away though, the song of his people starts again and doesn't end until he comes back, close to me. He also seems possessive of me. When he's chilling near me and one of my other cat wants in, he growls and gets annoyed even if they don't touch him but he doesn't attack them. He just... growls and leave if he's too annoyed.

Sorry this is longer than I wanted it to be and there's a lot of info but I don't know what this could be about and I'm really at a loss here. I've had 3 Toms in my life and never was confronted to that behavior before. Two factors I think might be the cause for his current behavior is 1 - I am a woman, and 2 - I got my period yesterday. My older Tom (Lilboi) never acted like this. I will have them neutered soon, I only need to scrape enough money to make sure I can handle the aftercare too.

I guess my question is: Should I be worried there is an underlying health problem although he eats well and is getting adjusted to the schedule, drinks well and still uses the litterboxes correctly? Or is it only sonething he does and I'm overthinking this because of adoption regret/guilt??  @_@???? T_T

From all my visual inspections of his little person, I can't see anything wrong. Also whenever I pet him I sorta palpate his body to make sure there's no lumps or scabs or anything weird anywhere... He also seems so generally much more content and happy since he understood that he's got a roof above his head then when I first got him. I am such at a loss with this situation. I love him so much but it's annoying when he starts yowling non-stop during the night.",LilithFaery,2022-12-01,01:13:15,2022,12,1,1,13,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,"I am really anxious about my new Persian kitten, need help","I have got a new 2.5 month-old Persian kitten yesterday. I got it from a place, where it had spent its short life with other kittens and cats. There was this elderly woman that was taking care of all of them. She showed us how to groom it, clean the tear drops beneath the eyes and what food to feed it. All was clear. However, while she was grooming it with a stainless double-sided comb, I felt instantaneously anxious since it started meowing. 

Let me briefly introduce you what I have done so far:

1. Brought it home and immediately left it in the bathroom for 15 minutes while I was driving my friend back to his place. ( He came with me to the place where we got the kitten from)
2. Came back home, put two bowls - one filled with water, the other with dry food (Royal Canin for Persian cats; I mistakenly got the one for adults) + put the litter box (silicone balls) - that was all put in the bathroom.
3. 2.5-3hrs later I opened the bathroom door and started talking gently to the kitty. It was still in the corner of the bathroom. Then I left it there for another 30 minutes.
4. Came back to the bathroom when again started gently talking to the kitty and after 2-3 minutes I slowly dragged it out of the corner and got it with me.
5. Went to the living room and laid on the couch, I put it on my chest and started slowly petting it while keeping gently talking 'We are friends, we wish no harm to each other...', it tried to escape a couple of times but I kept on petting it.
6. 3-4 minutes later I left it explore the apartment. 30 minutes later, it started slowly approaching me, until it got snugged itself between me and the couch pillow.
7. My girlfriend came home and felt like the whole story was starting from the beginning.
8. Fast forward, it ate a bit of the fresh wet food for Persian cats, then we went to bed. It took him 30-60 minutes to get accustomed to us and started slowly approaching us in bed. At the end, it slept by my head.
9. In the morning, it was cuddling with me. Now I went to the pet store to buy a double-sided comb and lotion for tear cleaning. Came back - it spent the 5 hours since I left the morning bed in the bed by itself. I was busy working at home.
10. I tried to slowly approach him, gently talking so I can get him and start combing and perhaps get the opportunity to clean beneath the eyes. Nope... it jumped off the bed and hissed at me.

First time hissing me...

It feels it doesn't eat enough, and I haven't seen any traces of urine or fecal in any of the rooms nor the litter box. It has been 24 hours since his new home.

I am kind of anxious, should I be more confident and get him no matter what so I can comb him and clean eyes or I should leave him be so he can fully accustomed to us for the next couple of days, while keeping an eye if he is eating and defecating?

1,CatAdvice,First kitten in a few days - so excited but also so many questions!,"Hi guys. Saturday I'm going to give a home to a sweet two months and a half kitten, and it will be my first pet. I've been reading a lot these days to prepare myself as better as possible, I bought everything needed, but I still have some doubts on how and what to do during the first hours/days. 
I have many questions so I will just do a list:

1) I'll have to travel two hours by car to get the kitten. I will bring with me a carrier with a blanket inside (maybe some small toys too?), I'll spray Feliway Classic 15 minutes before putting the kitten inside. Should I bring anything else? Food maybe? Water? Tips on how to put the kitten in the carrier for the first time? 
I also heard that covering the carrier with a blanket during the travel might help her feel more calm because of the darkness, is that right? 

2) Once home, should I let him roam freely at his own pace, or start by closing ourselves in a room and just chill there for the first day? I think the second option might be better and I was thinking to do so in my bedroom, bringing everything he might need (bowls for food/water, carrier, litter box) in my room temporarily. 
But I also heard that moving the litter box is not a good idea because the kitten might get confused and not be able to find it. Is this a concern? I will leave the litter box in a not crowded hallway, not in my bedroom, so I would definitely move it, if I choose to keep him closed in my room for the first hours.
Any other tips for the first 24 hours would definitely help.

3) Should I try to get him to the vet asap, or let him adjust to his new home first? I wanna be sure he's 100% fine but I also don't want to traumatize him with another ride in the carrier to the vet😢

4) Tips for playing with her? I bought some toys, but how can I entertain him for hours with the same toys? Won't he get bored after a while? I heard kittens need many hours of playtime to avoid zoomies so I wanna help her as much as possible.

Any tips helps guys, I want to make her feel as comfortable as possible🥺

1,CatAdvice,New cat and kitten advice - are we making progress or do they hate each other?,"Hi, 

We brought home a new female kitten to our home with a 4 year old male cat nearly 3 weeks ago. We kept them separated for the first few days and did scent swapping ect (although reading more into it now perhaps we should have done it longer). From first meeting they were both wary and tried to swat each other. 

We did lots of supervised play dates where they mostly chase each other, taking turns, but it still looks a bit aggressive to me. The older cat wouldn’t take his eyes off her when she was in the room or chill out. I separated them if the kitten ever made any noises she was hurt, or try to play with the kitten to distract from getting to this point. The thing is, they seem to wind each other up and if one of them stops pouncing and chasing the other one will start.

I thought we had a bit of a breakthrough last night, in the evening they were both asleep at the end of my bed for a while. Then later on, my partner accidentally left the kitten out of her safe room last night and they both slept on  our bed all night. However, this morning they were back chasing and fighting and the adult cat pinned the kitten down and she squeaked. 

I’m really unsure if they are starting to get on at all, or we need to start the process all over again. They don’t seem particularly phased from the fights and kitten seems to go back for more (she often winds up resident cat when he wants to chill), but I don’t want to risk them never coexisting.

1,CatAdvice,Cats tearing up our home,"My husband and I got a cat about 2 years ago and ended up getting a kitten about 1 year ago so that they would have each other when we were at work. I feel that we are in over our heads and I don’t know what to do. They tore the entire bottoms out of our brand new couches to climb inside and they use them as a scratching post despite having several actual scratching posts and cat towers around the house. We constantly brush them and vacuum the house but I feel like our house is coated in fur and so disgusting that I can’t invite anyone over. We have cat proofed EVERYTHING. We don’t have curtains because they would tear those up trying to get into the window. They’ve tore up so many of our blinds we just have to leave them up. We rigged a baby gate in front of the stairs because they love to rip the carpet off of the stairs. We can’t have any decorations or leave anything out without them getting knocked to the floor or chewed up. We’ve had to replace expensive appliances due to them chewing up cords. We’ve tried to do the bitter cat spray and that doesn’t work. They have tons of toys and we play with them with laser pointers and such. 
Aside from this they are great cats. The younger cat is super sweet and doesn’t know a stranger and even tries to play with our friend’s dog. The older cat is super attached to me and hides from anyone else. They are both sweethearts and never bite/scratch/hiss at us. I’m just at the point where I don’t feel comfortable in my own home and it’s like I have to accommodate every single thing I do to their behavior. My mom wants a cat so I thought about letting her have the younger one. But I worry about the cat who is attached to me and he is used to having the other cat around as well. It breaks my heart to even think about trying to rehome either of them, but what do I do?

So… (and I know this seems kinda dumb) is cat purring contagious, or did both cats actually have a nice time hanging out together last night?

1,CatAdvice,My cat has decided to start peeing in her water bowls,"TL;DR: My perfectly healthy cat has decided to start peeing a little in her water bowls but still uses her litterbox normally.

My cat Rogue is 13 y/o spayed female. She has never peed anywhere but her litterbox except the time she had crystals in her bladder (that was when she was about 3, she's been on special food ever since). She has recently started peeing a little bit in her water bowl once or twice a day. There have been no changes in the house/food/litter/anything, she just started doing it one day. I assumed it was because she had a UTI or something, so the first thing I did was to take her to the vet for a complete checkup, bloodwork, and urine analysis. She's perfectly healthy. 

She's always been a weird water cat, she likes to be in the shower and bathed, and she splashes in the water bowl CONSTANTLY. We have a huge rubber mat the size of a large towel with towels under it and on top of it to keep the floor dry, and have to replace the towels every other day or so and change the water multiple times a day because she also uses the water bowl to clean litter off her feet that gets stuck on her feet because her feet are almost always slightly damp from splashing in the water. It's really annoying, but I love her and if that's what makes her happy, whatever. The bowl used to be a large one because she shared it with the dog, and she would sit in the water and wash herself.

Then she started peeing in it a little every day. She still goes in her litterbox mostly, she's not primarily using the water to use the bathroom. Her litterbox is regularly cleaned and I haven't moved it or changed types of litter. I moved the large water bowl to the shower and she LOVES it there because I turn the shower on to refill the water bowl and she can stick her head under the running water as her bowl fills. I also fill it up even more than usual because it doesn't matter how much she splashes in there. She drinks from it but will also still sit in it and pee. The dog doesn't go in there so this water is 100% hers so I don't think it's a territorial thing. For the dog's water, we replaced it with a smaller bowl that she can't sit in so we figured she wouldn't pee in it if she can't sit in it. But no, she just squats over it and pees a little. 

We recently went on a trip and although I thoroughly explained the new situation to the pet sitter, the sitter decided to move the dog's water to the rug by his bed. Rogue of course peed and splashed in the water and it got all over the rug. The floor under the rug has a bit of water damage now and the rug is trash. 

I've tried getting her water fountains in the past, it only makes a mess because she will still splash and play in it. I haven't tried it since she's started peeing in the water bowls, but I think she will either just find a way to pee in it or just splash in it and continue to pee in the other water bowls. We can't put the dog's water anywhere she can't get to, so that's not an option either. The dog doesn't seem to care about the pee and will just drink it anyway, so we have to constantly monitor the water situation because it can't be good for him to drink piss water. 

This is getting ridiculous and it's stressing both me and my fiance out a lot. He suggested posting and asking for ""some Jackson Galaxy shit"" that we might not have thought of. I really hope someone has some advice because this is getting seriously annoying and I've run out of ideas. Thanks! &lt;3",KittyKupo,2022-11-30,09:14:13,2022,11,30,9,14,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,Leaving my kitten alone for eight hours out of necessity- what should I do?,"So basically I just recently saved this stray kitten that wandered into my moms school while she was at work, and she has been an absolute blessing.

The only thing I’m concerned about is that my mom goes to work every weekday for around eight hours, and every other week I’m gone for around five days. 

This means that for at least twice a month she’s alone in our house for around eight hours at a time. I’ve heard online that you aren’t supposed to leave kittens under four months of age alone for that long, but none of those sites go into detail about what would actually happens if you do this, so I’m worried about leaving her alone for that long. 

I’ve thought about having friends come check on her while I’m gone but I don’t think anyone would be willing to do this so I’m not sure what to do or if I might be overreacting. 

She has a dog there who she can play with from time to time so that might help, but I would love some insight into this if you guys can. Thank you!",ChipsAhoiMcCoy,2022-11-30,06:16:37,2022,11,30,6,16,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,Struggling with the idea of a new cat after mine passed,"Hi all. My cat I've had for 6 years had to be put down last week. She was so sick with multiple conditions, I know it was right but it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. 
I've always had pets, but she was the hardest cat I've ever had. Her condition required 2 medications daily that couldn't be missed by even an hour. She was so aggressive ( was a stray before ) at the vet any little thing required full sedation, often even two times the normal amount. She was extremely destructive to the point where we had cameras with motion detection all over our apartment ( also due to her condition). Basically for the last year she worsened I've been in a constant state of worry.at the same time , she also had wonderful qualities like sleeping through the night and understanding not to scratch furniture.  I don't regret a second of it, but here is my problem : I am terrified of getting a new cat(s) because I don't even remember what it's like to not be constantly worried and scared about them. Yes, they will have their own issues but it can't be like she was. Yet I am afraid I'll never be ready to get another because of the intense fear I have of them causing me this anxiety  . I've been devastated this week, but also very relieved. I guess I am just looking for anyone who had something similar happen?",That_Suggestion_6469,2022-11-30,04:48:48,2022,11,30,4,48,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,How to give a stubborn cat a pill!,"I can’t believe I did this, and I felt bad doing it. But I had to give my cat a pill to calm her before going to the vet. I tried every trick, putting it in her mouth directly, emptying it in food and mixing it but she wouldn’t eat the food (she stopped eating, part of why she was going to the vet). I was desperate, I knew she’d have a terrible time and so would the vet if she didn’t take the pill. I even put the wet food on my fingers and tried to put it in her mouth. A little got on her cheek and I watched her clean herself, licking her paw, getting it off her cheek, then licking it clean. I realized I had to do it, I apologized, grabbed a handful of the cat food medicine mixture, and smeared it over my calico’s pretty white fur. On her paw, on her cheeks. And she cleaned it all off. And she’s as chill as can be. 

Figured if anyone’s desperate and the pill is too big for them to swallow and they refuse to eat that this is a last resort option.

After Christmas, I'm getting a pet cat through a Co-worker. Her husband didn't want a third cat in the home so she rescued it and kept it for a couple of months.

I was wondering if it would be a good idea to adopt a second cat the same time from the shelter and bring them and introduce them to my home at the same time.

1,CatAdvice,Cat suddenly spooked and hiding,"For the past couple days our 1 year cat has suddenly been getting spooked easily and hiding. No other noticeable symptoms like injury. Nothing has changed at home like new people or pets. 

She’s usually meowing, playing and spending lots of time in the living room. But a few days ago I noticed she’s been a lot quieter and would suddenly get a jolt of energy, run around quickly and then dash to the den. Even when we brought her out to the living room she would stay for a couple minutes and then suddenly  run around very fast and then dash to the den (maybe it’s a ghost). 

Today she’s been hiding under the coat rack. Doing the same thing. She’ll only come out to meow for food or use her litter and then quickly back under the coat rack. When I pull her out and hold her she purrs, is comfortable and falls asleep but as soon as I put her down she tries to hide.

Her litter seems fine and she still eats like normal.

The vet prescribed her a supplement for now. I have a few questions:

- Should I stop playing games where she has to run, jump? Is it better to play calmer games? Even though she did appear to be slower she didn’t seem in any pain
- Are there any accomodations that could relieve her discomfort? Like heating pads, vitamins etc?

1,CatAdvice,Wondering if another cat would improve my cat's life,"hi there! i'm gonna preface this post with saying i'm constantly anxious about giving my tortie the best life she could ever have, so i may be overthinking things.

i adopted my tortie a year and a half ago from a shelter that said she would do best as a single cat. it was love at first sight and i have done my best to give her everything she could possibly want - i've kept an eye on her health (she's got some upper respiratory issues) and i've showered her in toys and playtime! she is the star of the household, and when i'm not playing with her and she's not sleeping, my mother's giving her lots of attention and letting her chase her tape measure/fabric scraps while she sews. basically: kahlua is spoiled and we wouldn't have it any other way.

recently, though, all of the playtime we've been giving her hasn't been enough. i've come downstairs to find the little wand toys she loves so much pulled out of the storage spot i've put them in and broken in half - she apparently taught herself how to use them on her own, but they couldn't handle her strength. she's been hopping on my mother's dresser, which she never used to do, and knocking over the ironing board in my mom's room. i've tried playing with her more, but at this rate, that's the only thing i would be able to do all day - and while i would love to do that for her, i do have other responsibilities.

i know cats are social animals, and i also know kahlua is very, very attached to me. if i'm out of the house for more than an hour, i get a lecture when i get home, and she doesn't leave my side for a few hours until she's sure i'm home for the rest of the night. so i've been thinking about maybe adopting another cat from a rescue - maybe on the younger side, since she did have kittens before i adopted her - to give her a companion when i can't devote all my attention to her. would this possibly help her feel more fulfilled? if i was told she would be best in a one-cat household, would that still hold true all this time later? if i do get another cat, should it be a younger one or one that's older than her? i don't want to adopt a cat and have to rehome it shortly afterwards - that's not fair to the other kitty. i want to get through this with as little harm as possible done to all cats involved.

any advice/feedback is appreciated! if you have any questions to clarify anything, please ask. above all, her wellbeing and health is my #1 priority.",latinnameluna,2022-11-30,00:31:04,2022,11,30,0,31,Wednesday

I would have gotten up, but im so drowsy from being sick i kept drifting off. This lead to him eventually pouncing on me to jolt me awake, then lying down where my head was with the pillow so i wouldnt lie back down. 

He was fed a nice big meal an hour ago and my partner is up and about in the house if he wants someone to play with so Im unsure why he's doing this.

He hid under the couch (he still does) but has started coming out to hang out with us but only in the evenings since 2 days ago. He will head butt us, allow us to pet him and will also rub on us. However sometimes it’s like he forgets who we are and will shy away if we try to pet him, even hissing sometimes if we come near him. He meows a few times loudly before hissing. About an hour ago, he had cornered me at the end of the hallway where I had just left the bedroom. He meowed and then proceeded to hiss at me and i was afraid to move. I have done my research and I understand that he is still getting used to us but i don’t understand why he cornered me and hissed at me.",UnlikelyEnergy8620,2022-11-29,23:20:01,2022,11,29,23,20,Tuesday
1,CatAdvice,"Roommate doesn’t take care of her cat, I’m having to pick up the slack","So, for some background: I lived with this girl for the past year and a half, and she is definitely a very disorganized and dirty person. By dirty, I mean FILTHY. Unrelated to the car situation, she leaves dishes in the sink for months, leaves her crap all around the apartment, and does not seem to feel at all ashamed when I have to call her out on these things. Her room is her personal space, yes, but when I say filthy, words cannot even begging to describe her room. We’ve had roach issues in the past, yet she has done nothing to help quell the situation. I hate to be that person that calls people out, but my other roommate is so sweet and also doesn’t speak English well, so she doesn’t communicate with this roommate. 

Now that you all have gotten the gist of how this girl generally lives, let me explain the situation. My cat is fed twice a day, once in the morning before I go to work and once at night. My roommates cat always hovers around at feeding time, and if I close the door he literally will destroy the door (has in the past); as a result, he ends up eating at least half of her food. This causes a lot of stress for me and my cat; I can tell that my cat is anxious about food all of the time, and feels rushed to eat, while I just worry if I’m feeding her enough since I’m not home a lot. I left for break this past weekend, and I filled up a bowl with at least eight servings of food, and moved it downstairs (my roommates cat avoids leaving the top floor). My other roommate that was helping me take care of my cat while I was gone told me that her food bowl was empty, not even at the end of the day. Todo literally ate ALL of the food in less than a day. Like….. I’m living paycheck to paycheck. If I could afford two cats, I would have another cat. Anyways, this is the same situation with the litter. I’ve been wondering why her litter box has been filling up so fast…. Come to find out that my roommates cats litter box is rarely cleaned. I’ve been going through so much of it it’s insane. I also found out that my roommate doesn’t even have water/food bowls set out for her cat…. she’s just been giving him cans of food (even though he’s clearly food obsessed and should be fed more than once a day). Why even have a cat at that point. 

What do I do about this situation? I’ve tried spraying him with water, but as a lot of you know, that doesn’t work at all, it just temporarily deters him. My roommate hasn’t been perceptive to my polite requests in the past, so I doubt she’ll be receptive to me basically telling her to take better care of her cat. I myself struggle to keep up with ONE cat with my hectic schedule, so I feel like it’s unfair that I’m literally taking care of her cat as well. 

TLDR; I’m broke, living with two other roommates, my one roommates cat is using up all that I buy for my cat. My roommate is not very clean or organized, and she’s the same way with her cat. How do I approach the situation, knowing that my roommate doesn’t really care and isn’t a considerate person? I love her cat to pieces but I did not sign up for this.",theindianwallflower,2022-11-29,22:43:14,2022,11,29,22,43,Tuesday

1,CatAdvice,"struggling with ignoring ""legitimate"" playtime at night","hey y'all-

we have a 7-month-old brother and sister pair (both spayed and neutered!) who are delightful and deeply loving. the boy is more energetic than she is--he definitely needs/wants more attention. we had been keeping them in a safe room overnight since adopting them at 4 months (with food, water, toys, bedding, etc) but are now trying to transition into letting them have the run of the house overnight. We live in a decently sized apartment, and while they've both gotten the hang of falling asleep at the foot of our bed, every night thus far two things happen: 1) one or both of them start purring and standing on our heads/chest to wake us up around 2:30 am (this we have been dealing with by either fully ignoring or by wordlessly moving them back to the end of the bed/off the bed) 2) he will initiate playing around 5 am. This morning they raced around the house for a half-hour, with the final lap taking place in/over our bed. every 4 minutes, they'd both land on our bed, tear across our legs, and race back out of the room. They didn't seem too concerned with us (i.e., specifically attention seeking)--which made me unsure how to apply the Jackson Galaxy ignore method. Eventually, my husband quietly closed our bedroom door, and they didn't complain. Is shutting them out for playing giving them attention? We're trying to be really consistent in how we approach this, so they get the hang of things and we cut down on our nighttime wake-ups. It's not been terrible, but we're both a little cranky a week in.",hotbabayaga,2022-11-29,22:02:54,2022,11,29,22,2,Tuesday

1,CatAdvice,Neighbours cat won’t leave us alone?,"Hi all I’m after some advice please,

My next door neighbours cat basically won’t leave me alone? Every time I go outside into the garden it’s there, and when I try to go back into the house it sits by my back door and meows to come in, I have to basically open the door slightly and jump in, otherwise it will come in with me. It then sits by the door meowing and scratching the door. It’s now progressed to sitting on the window ledge, to the point where we can’t open the window or the door in summer as it will come in.

The cat is very well looked after by my neighbour, she has a collar and is well groomed and well fed. My neighbour loves her very much basically.

Is there anything we can do to stop this? It’s kind of getting on our nerves? Please don’t suggest that the cat is ours now, and we should take him. I’m allergic, and my dad has OCD. We’re really not in the position to have a cat 😂.

1,CatAdvice,Getting 2 male cats to get along,"I could use some advice.

Cat A - ~8 years old, fixed, some anxiety issues and a Bottle Brat so can be aggressive at times.  Declawed (not by us).

Cat B - ~4 years old, fixed, sweet and gentle with people but very playful and gets the zoomies a lot, and has shown some nervousness and aggression with cat A but seems calm now.

It’s been 5 months since B came to the house and we are still having to juggle the two.  They get to other sides of glass doors or screens where they are separated and just kind of stare at each other.  They seem curious about each other so long as there is some kind of force field between them, but ready to jump each other when there isn’t.  We were going to try to introduce them this evening, but A was having a day and was overtly aggressive with us so we nixed it.

We don’t know where to go from here.  Right now they are still isolated from each other and we don’t know how to transition from keeping them separated to commingling without there being WW3.  They aren’t really food motivated so the feeding and treats on either side of the door isn’t really working.

1,CatAdvice,Keep both litter boxes or nah,I currently live in a studio apartment with my cat. I have one litter box for her in a closet that she uses and another top entry box in a different corner of the space because I understand this is better for her to have two. My issue is the apartment is small and there is only so much room for activities. My cat only uses the second litter box to jump in and out of during playtime. She has never used it for bathroom purposes. My current dilemma is that I think I would like to get rid of this litter box since she isn't using it for the intended purpose. I am curious if anyone has a strong opinion either way on me keeping it or letting it go. Thank you.,hardcandyxmas,2022-11-29,16:22:59,2022,11,29,16,22,Tuesday

I was completely shocked. I felt bad infact. Then as usual i played with him for sometime. Still no purr. He is not avoiding me or anything but there is no PURR like usual.

1,CatAdvice,"A week together, any tips?","Hello fellow Redditors, 
Yesterday my sweet daughter had to move in for a week because the appartement has to be renovated. She brought her two cats and one doggie. This we found the best solution for her having autism and we don’t want the pets to be in a shelter, especially because of hers are rescues. 

I have four cats and a golden retriever. The vet already gave me a week amount alprazolam for the retriever because of him being hyper-hyper-hyper and even didn’t want to breath normal or rest. Her doggie is calm though but snapped a few times at my hyper pancake. 

Three cats are veeeerry upset. Three of mine are ok with it (calm characters), one of mine is hiding and growling. Both of my daughters are growling. Last night I heard one biiig scream. A few things are broken by now by running away from each other. 

I have an extra litter box. I sprayed feromones. There is constant supervision the whole week except when we sleep. I put extra water and food on an extra different place. We are acting calm and all of us grew up with cats and dogs knowing their language. 

Fellows, do you have any tips for us? What can we do to remain calmness?

1,CatAdvice,Cat wont stop meowing.,"So my gf cat won't stop meowing or playing at night and gf cant get any sleep because of it. If she locks her out of the room  she doesn't stop meowing all night directly at the door, if she lets her in all the cat wants to do is play and will jump at her faces while we sleep with her claws to try and get her to play. She has a second cat that normally plays with her pretty much anytime they're awake so she is definitely getting enough play time. They get fed wet food twice a day and two bowls of dry food a day so I'm pretty sure they're getting enough food. She doesn't know what to do at this point and has brought her self to thinking  of just getting rid of the cat because she is not getting any sleep at all.

1,CatAdvice,Vacation and cats,"My older cat (2yo male) has never had a problem with being alone and typically prefers it. I will typically leave for two or three days at a time (maybe a few times a year) while he stays at home with his automatic feeder and kitty box. I would usually have a friend come peek in and make sure he had someone to hang with for an hour or so then fill up his water bowl and leave. It gave me a pretty good sense of freedom and made me feel comfortable as I was able to watch his food be dispensed and monitor him with a little camera. We adopted a new kitten a few months ago and he is very dominant around food. He will push my older cat away to eat his food when he is finished with his own and will not stay at his own bowl. We went home for thanksgiving and were gone 3 days. Before we left we tested the feeder twice at dinner and breakfast to make sure both boys were eating and able to share. Everything went fine. When we watched the camera the first night we realized my older cat was shoved out of the way and our kitten ate literally all of the food that was dispensed. We had a friend come and feed them instead of using the automatic feeder. 
I don’t want to board them and I don’t want my poor friend to have to come over twice a day to feed them and watch the little one to make sure my older cat eats. 
Should we get another automatic feeder and seperate them into different rooms while we are gone or just bite the bullet and pay for a sitter?",butterflyeffect90210,2022-11-29,12:54:50,2022,11,29,12,54,Tuesday
1,CatAdvice,my cat did a stomp,"I was just lying on the couch when my cat came up to my pillow and did a stomp, that's right, a stomp.

This leads me to believe he was demanding attention. Now see it's not like I ignore him, he acts like a tsundare all the time when I try to pet him, so I try to give him space and engage only when he comes to me.

It’s my first Christmas in my new apartment and also my first one with my cat. She’s a 9 month old Ragdoll who is mostly docile but can get mischievous sometimes. 

Today I bought a fake Christmas tree to put up for the holidays, and my cat was almost immediately curious. Ever since I’ve put it up, she has approached it many times and tried to nibble at the branch ends / bristles until I stop her. The good news is she doesn’t seem to want to attack it or jump on / in it, but i have heard that ingesting these bristles can cause intestinal damage or death in cats. Most of the bristles do not pull off easy, but I have seen a few come off fairly easily. 

Should I be concerned to leave her alone with the tree? Do any of you put up fake trees with your cats around? Any tips are appreciated. Thanks",Insane_Wanderer,2022-11-29,12:17:10,2022,11,29,12,17,Tuesday

1,CatAdvice,Introducing Kitten to 12 Year Old Cat,"My wife and I just adopted a 6 month old male kitten (NK) from the shelter here. Already neutered, up to date shots, clean bill of health. Brought him home on Saturday. Absolute cuddle bug and hates being separated from people. This is our first time introducing cats.

Resident cat (RC) is a 12 year old female, spayed. She was adopted with another cat (sadly, passed away last year) back in 2010. She's very bonded to me; she only goes to my wife when I'm not arround.

We're doing a modified introduction plan - I work nights and RC spends the day sleeping with me in the bedroom; during this time NK is allowed out to explore.

Quick breakdown of the days so far:

Day 1:
RC growling and hissing when she saw (he got out once by accident) or smelled NK, and on edge. During the accudental meeting, lots of hissing and staring from RC, but no outward aggression and RC ended up fleeing. NK just stared back with no noise.

Day 2:
We gave NK a bath to get the shelter smell off him (read that elsewhere). RC would growl if she smelled NK on me, but was more curiius about his scent elsewhere (lots if sniffing, no noise). RC would approach NK's door with caution and stop about 5 feet away, eventually getting spooked and fleeing. Still hissing if she saw NK batting under the door. RC is mostly back to her normal routine, other than investigating the door.

Day 3 (today):
RC is now getting within 3 feet if the door. Less csution now; her tail is more in a ""I'm curious"" position. She doesn't flee the door; she'll stare and then mosey back with her tail up, wanting attention. I can now touch NK, then go right to RC and let her sniff; I get a brief grumble and then RC rubs her head on my hands. No issue with scents anywhere else in the shared area. A quick hiss or two if she sees NK batting under the door (we put a box to block the sightline now), but then RC just trots away like nothing happened. NK really starting to indicate he wants out of his room when we put him in there, although he usually calms down after 20 minutes.


Just looking for reassurance that this is going well (seems like it is to me)? Both cats are eating normal, no litter issues, and RC seems very much back to normal behaviours around us, other then being a bit more attentive to noise coming from NK's room.

Also wondering at what point I should consider cracking the door a bit and letting them start seeing each other, with a barrier between them.

1,CatAdvice,Whiskas perfect portions feedback,"Seeking some feedback on Whiskas - for background my cat is 5, no health concerns, all wet food diet. All the posts I've read here say not to give your cat Whiskas (most equate it to mcdonalds for your cat...)

I saw they have a new product (or at least new in Canada) - whiskas perfect portions. According to their packaging, they are formulated to meet AAFCO. The ingredients (for the beef flavour) are: BEEF, CHICKEN, WATER, POULTRY LIVER, POULTRY BROTH, VITAMINS AND MINERALS, COLOUR, GUAR GUM, SODIUM TRIPOLYPHOSPHATE, FISH OIL (PRESERVED WITH MIXED TOCOPHEROLS), DL-METHIONINE, TAURINE, SALT.

Honestly, these seem pretty solid and I'm tempted to try them with my cat. I'm hesitant because of all the Whiskas naysayers and would love any feedback! I just want to make sure I'm giving my cat something healthy but also would love to back it up if people think I'm being a bad cat parent!",comfreytea,2022-11-29,08:04:03,2022,11,29,8,4,Tuesday

1,CatAdvice,Adopted a cat that’s still nervous,"Hi everyone. Just wondering if anyone has gone through something similar and can help give advice from their experiences. I adopted a cat 3 weeks ago. She was very nervous at first and we just kind of left her to it when we brought her home, didn’t approach her just left her to figure out her surroundings first. Majority of the time she would just hideaway and either eat her food, use her litter tray or play when we were out of the house or at night. The house has plenty of safe hiding spaces for her and we’ve even got feliway plug ins to try relax her. We were able to start playing with her with a wand toy and she was happily playing. 

We then took her to the vets last week because she had a funny looking eye from previous trauma and wasn’t up to date on vaccines. After the vets she hid under out TV unit (a new space she hadn’t been in before) and now spends most of her time there. She’s still playing, eating, using the litter tray overnight but she just seems even more terrified now. 

I am feeling a little hopeless that she will never trust us. But I also accept it’s only been 3 weeks since she moved in with us. Any tips or advice would be hugely appreciated. Thanks :)",randomhedgehogs,2022-11-29,05:29:39,2022,11,29,5,29,Tuesday
1,CatAdvice,Cats (male/2 and female/5 both neutered) keep waking me up playing at 4:00am,"I have two cats, Nepher and Billy.  Every morning around 3 or 4 am, Billy wakes up and wants to play.  Problem is, he always wants to play with Nepher and she sleeps on my bed with me.  My bed instantly transforms from a quiet place for me to sleep into a playground for hyperactive cats.  Sometimes, Nepher doesn’t want to play and she’ll hiss or growl at Billy.  

They both know that the first thing I do when I wake up is feed them and in the morning is when they get canned food so they’re especially excited to eat then.  I know feeding them will quiet them down but I also know that waking up and feeding them at 4am is just begging for them to get some bad habits.  I can kick Billy out of the bedroom and get some sleep but I don’t like kicking him out.

1,CatAdvice,I failed my foster to adopt and have to take him back to the shelter. Will he feel abandoned?,"A few months ago someone dumped a sweet kitty, around 2 or 3yo, in the parking lot of my apartment. I gained his trust and was able to catch him and drop him off at the pound. I offered to take him for a ""trial run"" after he was neutered and given his shots because one, he already trusted me, and two, this is a rural area and the shelter is small and just totally full of kitties. He was so friendly, and I felt like we had a bond, so I was willing to try and adopt him.

I never heard back from the pound and after 1.5 months I found him at the PetSmart up for adoption. I was able to take him finally for a trial run/foster to adopt period. We've had him for about 2 months. From the start he was the most goofy, hyper, loving kitty. I'm totally attached. The problem is, the resident kitty, around 8yo, is NOT. We did the Jackson Galaxy intro method throughout the whole 2 months he's been here. Resident cat still hates his guts and constantly hisses and swats at him whenever he is nearby. He wants to play with her but she can't stand him and is more of a couch potato. I had really hoped they'd become friends. We also found out my partner is really allergic to him (but not resident kitty, for some reason). Finally, I think my apartment is just too small for a cat with his energy level when he has no playmates besides me, and I work :( 

Anyway, I asked the pound if I could just foster him, but they said I have to bring him back if I'm not going to adopt him. My question is-- will he be scared or lonely or confused when I take him back? I feel so guilty and like I failed him. They said they would either put him in the communal cat room so he can play and socialize, or they would send him back to PetsMart. I hope he would get adopted quickly because of how friendly and cute he is.",lamb_eater,2022-11-29,03:55:17,2022,11,29,3,55,Tuesday

When they came out of the wash one day and weren’t quite cleaned, I threw them back in the hamper to rewash and he jumped in and rolled around on them for an hour. 

In my kitchen cabinet, I hang old cloths and when they’re dry, throw them in a bucket for washing. The bucket was gone so I was just throwing them in the bottom of the cabinet and he took it upon himself to break into the cabinet, pull out all the cloths and roll in them!

1,CatAdvice,Cat stares at us when cuddling,"Hi everyone. I’m hoping to get some insight into what’s going on in my friends car when this happens. 

To tell a bit about her, she does her own thing like all cats do and she likes affection sometimes. 

Sometimes she goes on the kitchen counter top when we’re there and comes to me for affection. She does that thing where after a pet her she turns around and shows me her butt which I learned recently is a sign of trust, so that’s great and all. But what I’m curious about now is her staring thing. 

So there’s a coffee table between the couch where we sit and the tv. When my friend and I are just lying there cuddling or start making out she would just jump up onto the table, face US not the tv, curl her tail around her body and just stare at us. I feel like she gets up onto the coffee table so she’s eye level with us. 

She doesn’t sit directly in front of the tv because there’s a large gap between the table and the tv, so she’s not looking for warmth from the tv screen (like I read in other posts). And when she sits there it’s directly in front of us and right in our line of sight so she’s basically blocking the tv screen with her body. 

I’m just curious to know what’s going on in her head, her motives, if it’s curiosity towards us making out and she wants a front row seat or what. Any insight would be greatly appreciated about the staring but moreso about why she gets directly in our line of sight of the tv and sits there. Attention? Jealousy?

1,CatAdvice,Any considerations before adopting?,"So I'm (28F) currently going through a breakup and I'm left with the prospect of a very empty house once my partner moves out. My sister suggested maybe getting a cat and it's planted the thought in my mind. 

Firstly, I understand that I can't just get a cat to rely on to fill my loneliness, that's not really the point. I've always been an animal lover and I'm a vegan so I have plenty of respect for animals. I'd like to adopt because there are plenty of cats out there who deserve a loving home, I don't need to go to a breeder. 

My question is, what do I need to consider before I commit to this? I have previously had family pets but nothing I have solely been responsible for. I have a decent sized house with a garden in a quiet, friendly neighbourhood. No kids. My work is very varied, some days WFH, some days out 8-5, some days half and half. 

Any advice is much appreciated 😊",Cr00kedSmi13,2022-11-28,21:48:55,2022,11,28,21,48,Monday

1,CatAdvice,the stray cat finally trusts me,"So a little follow-up from my last post where I was wondering how to get the stray cat inside. It ended up that I didn't need to use a trap as she let me pet her so I just picked her up and brought her inside. She was timid at first but warmed up to me incredibly quickly. She lets me pet her and rubs up on me and weirdly enough enjoys head-butting me and licking me. I'm going to take all of this as a good sign.  She did have a microchip and the vet did attempt to contact her owner but the number was incorrect and they appear to have moved elsewhere.  

So I have decided to adopt her. My only issue now is she isn't really confident going about my house. she's very unsure of her surroundings and I do not know if there is anything I can do to help settle her in.  Also, I had a very hard first night with her. She really didn't want to be alone so I let her stay in my room and she finally decided to sleep at 2 am and periodically woke up to groom herself. She then woke me up at 6 am with a dead mouse in her mouth. and demanded pets.   


What can I do to help her feel more at ease and also settled into the new environment? Is there any sort of behavior I need to be encouraging or discouraging? I read online that overgrooming is something cats do when stressed. So how do I stop it?",A1234910,2022-11-28,21:22:05,2022,11,28,21,22,Monday
1,CatAdvice,Kittens shedding loads,"My kittens are 7 months old . They've shed fur here and there and we brush them once a day or every couple days. Over the last week, the male kitten has started to shed much more. Last night we were joking about our female kitten being hypoallergenic because she barely shed compared to our male kitten. 

This morning she walked across my desk for some pets and *there were fur flying as she walked*. His shedding got worse too - one pet from head to tail and you are rewarded with tufts of fine fur. 

I'm assuming this is pretty normal as it's getting to proper winter where we are? The problem is we just brushed the kittens for a solid 3 minutes and you can still gently pull/pinch fur out! If you just gently pull on a tuft of fur you'd get around 6-10 strands of fur and this is after brushing that area.

1,CatAdvice,Teenage cat causing trouble on purpose!,"Hello!

My cat L (7 months) has been stressing me out recently. He’s sweet, cuddly, loves everyone, and isn’t too much of a hassle until he gets the zoomies.

Since L has reached the teenage life stage, he’s began to act out purposefully when he’s bored. He won’t use any toys and uses everything else as a replacement. He goes on my nightstand and knocks everything off and other undesired cat behaviors. Something he’s picked up recently is scratching and pulling on my mattress to make noise as he’s a very quiet cat and doesn’t meow much. When he does these things I either completely ignore him, or I’ll put him in ‘time out’ (another room) for a minute while I compose myself. I fear the second option isn’t working anymore as he’s began sprinting into small spaces so I can’t get to him. It seems he now views this as a game.

His behaviors were tolerable until we adopted another kitten (‘S’, recently homed, 5-6 months) around 2 months ago and they’ve been inseparable since, causing both cats to pick up these behaviors from each other. Prior to adopting the second cat, I would kick him out of my room (mostly at night) when he did anything ‘bad’. Now, he does this to scratch at my roommates door to see S. It’s annoying for the both of us as we live in an apartment and his sibling has already torn the carpet up in attempts to get out. 

Another thing is that him and his sibling only play and rarely relax around each other. They’ve integrated very well and love each other, but when his sibling is getting more attention he begins scratching and knocking at things. L also will begin pestering S when he plays with anything but him. 

I’m very lost in this situation as L isn’t a bad cat at all. He’s very well trained and is perfect until he gets bored. Could someone give me ways to eliminate these behaviors? Some ways to enrich his life in ways I haven’t done? I want to ensure he’s content and it seems what I’ve provided isn’t enough for him at the moment.",DemandMajor,2022-11-28,17:43:30,2022,11,28,17,43,Monday
1,CatAdvice,Cat suddenly using various rooms in the house as its litterbox.,"My wife's cat is being treated with chemo and when she first started everything was fine but then they had to change the type of chemo being administered and it seemed around that time that she started using our dining room for everything and almost never her litter box and we're not sure what to do. We put some gates up so she can't get into the dining room but now she's started going in the hallway right outside the door.

When my wife first moved in a couple of years ago we slowly introduced her two cats to mine and while they're not friends they get along well enough. The subject of this post hisses and keeps her distance but they never fight and my cat couldn't care less about any of it. This went on for about a year or so with no litter issues.

We've tried changing her litter box to different types like more open or bigger. The litter comes from Kitty Poo Club and it's what my wife's used for years but we've not tried changing it yet. We've also tried a pee pad but she has no interest in it and it's gone completely unused.

The vet treating her cancer said there's no medical reason as to why her behavior has changed so much and we're just at a loss as to what else to try.",Giggles122,2022-11-28,17:06:07,2022,11,28,17,6,Monday

1,CatAdvice,Feeding kitten with adult cats while away?,"Hi all! We have a new kitten homing with our 2 current adult cats (both just over 1). My question is, anyone have any ideas/tips on how to best feed them while we are at work? 

The adult cats are similar age so it was easy before, we left plenty of food for them both to graze on throughout the day. But now, one of the adult cats is a hungry boy all the time! He will (and tries when we are there) to gobble up his food, the other cats food, AND the kitten food. I just know he will get fat and obviously don’t want that.

So do I just accept his fate (until the kitten is nearing adult food) and allow them all to have access to plenty of food? Not a great idea I believe. 

Alternatively do I keep them separated all day so they have their own food? Only issue with this is that the kitten is the child of both adult cats and is SUPER affectionate/tactile. It would break my heart for him to be locked away in a room on his own all day.

I saw somewhere I could put the kittens food in a place only the kitten had access too (through a small gap of boxes). But this may not be ideal as the daddy cat is big and strong and it won’t be long I suspect until the kitten is the same size as mummy cat who is quite small. I also have one of those chip collar feeding bowls coming but I just know again that daddy cat will come over when baby cat is eating and push his head in when the food bowl opens up.

Was wondering what others did in the same situation or if there are any tips people had. Thanks everyone 🐱",AhhDeeNo,2022-11-28,15:50:29,2022,11,28,15,50,Monday
1,CatAdvice,Is there more I should be doing,"So, I am anxious I ruined the lives of two cats. Like crying anxious. 

In October I adopted a cat that I’ve bonded with; she’s a 5 month old cat and she’s a sweetheart she went through a traumatising ordeal with other cats, but she has since opened up and is a wonderful young lady. 

In November 26th I adopted a 3 year old cat. She is gorgeous, and needs a chance at a home as she has been in the shelter for 3 years and has been returned once when she had babies. 

I got her and set her up with her own room. They are separated by a door and haven’t met. Everyday I sit with the 3 year old in the floor and read a book (she took the couch). She just stares at me and eats next to me, doesn’t want me touching her and she hissed which is fine I’m still new to her. I don’t touch her I literally sit there and read. I’m scared she’s unhappy. She sleeps in the same room as me and showed me her belly partially. I bought her threee beds because I wasn’t sure what she liked and she sees me feeding her

Idk if there is more I can do or how to show her I’m cool - I’m just scared.",deathmetalshark,2022-11-28,15:19:40,2022,11,28,15,19,Monday

1,CatAdvice,Seeking cat integration reassurance/advice!,"Hey pals! I have a 6 year old cat we adopted when he was 8 weeks old and hasn’t seen another cat since. Last week we took home a foster with the hopes of failing- she’s a year old.

Our resident cat has now been forced to face the fact that he is not in fact a human being and is experiencing some existential dread as a result. 

We did the whole separate room scent swapping thing, peeks through the door/baby gate etc. Yesterday they met face to face &amp; today we let them spend more time together. There has been no attacking which is a HUGE relief! But our resident cat just growls at the new cat whenever she’s in eye line. Like long sustained growls. I feel terrible for the new cat who is just trying to play with a mouse toy, and worried for our resident cat that he is v stressed. When we separate them they both seem totally fine; there isn’t any ongoing stress once they’re apart from each other. 

I literally JUST ordered a Feliway &amp; I’m hoping that helps to mellow my resident cat a bit. Should we go back to peeks through the door? The new cat is desperate to get out of her room so she spends most of that time just scrabbling to get out. Should I chill out and just accept that this is part is the process?

1,CatAdvice,Newly adopted shelter cat avoiding any contact and meowing at the balcony door,"Hi! I adopted a 3 year old cat 10 days ago(I know it’s not very long ago) and he’s been doing alright. Eating and drinking well, playing a little bit and exploring. However at the shelter they said he was very vocal and liked to be petted with chin scratches and behind the ears, but he won’t let me nor my parents even close to him. If we try and reach out he shys away and I’m scared this will become a problem for vet visits, maintaining his fur and checking him for ticks etc. during the summer. He doesn’t run away and hide but he seems very uncomfortable with hands in general. I’ve been trying to work with him by first giving him a treat and walk to the other side of the room then proceeding to get closer every time he gets a treat to gain his trust. I’m at the point where he will most of the time eat it from my hand but backs off if I move my hand afterwards. When I do have a treat in my hand he will eat it and lick my hand for a while afterwards. He also sniffs our feet and sometimes hands but if I try and pretend to have a treat to get him close he won’t bat an eye and just stare at me. The first three days he only laid under our sofa but he’s been starting to lay in the sofa and around on the floor now but sometimes hides under the sofa again(which is totally fine as he probably like the fact that he gets space but still can be aware of where we are) He always follow us around and wants to be around us but at a distance.  I know I haven’t had him for long and that he’s probably still getting used to a new house and family but I worry that he won’t ever be more comfortable for his sake. We don’t know what he has been through but we know he was found on a landfill but he was already neutered but not chipped so someone either left him there or he was let outside too early and got lost. I’m just very stressed that I’m doing something wrong or it wasn’t a good fit comparing to the two previous cats I’ve had. 

The other things is that for the past two days he’s beeen laying next to our balcony door or looking outside the window on the door meowing a lot as if he really wants to go outside but I dont want to let him outside before I know he’s fully comfortable and knows that this is his home and where to return and since it’s winter I was planning on just keeping him inside till spring because where I live it snows, freezing temps and there’s only two hours of daylight during winter time and if he were to get lost or trapped he wouldn’t stand a chance with this weather but I’m afraid I’m torturing him by keeping him inside for so long.

1,CatAdvice,How long does it take a cat to forgive? Have I completely lost my cat's trust?,"TL;DR: My nervous cat seems to be scared of me and hates me now because of the medicine I've been feeding her. Looking for insights as to how long it'll take for her to forgive me and perhaps some advice about how to give her medication so that it isn't as stressful for both of us. 

Some quick backstory: I adopted my three-year-old cat a little over a year ago, and it was a challenge at first. She was super shy and refused to go out of hiding for two months. I spent a lot of time and energy building up trust and now she's the most loving and annoying little cat ever. Fast forward to this past week, which has been a hectic one. I moved her back from my parents' house two weekends ago, where she had been staying for roughly six weeks while I was in and out of the city for work. Everything seemed okay, until I noticed her scooting twice and licking her butt and tail a lot, so I took her to the vet this past weekend. Since she absolutely loathes her carrier, these two experiences were not great for her.

The vet gave me some cream to rub on her butthole and some liquid Clavamox. Giving her the medication has proven to be a huge challenge, to the point where I can only really give her both medications once a day instead of twice a day as prescribed. She hides under the couch (and sometimes in the couch), refuses to eat even when there's no medicine mixed with her wet food or treats (thankfully still eating dry food), and is so much more stressed and nervous around me. She's only approached me twice today, and it's only the second day of having to give her medicine.

Normally, my cat forgives me for taking her to the vet or moving her around relatively quickly, usually within a few hours. The fact that she seems so scared of me now and is avoiding me breaks my heart, and it seems that all the work I put into getting her to trust me has been completely undone. I don't even know how I'll be able to continue for the rest of the week, which is the length of time the medicine has been prescribed for.

On the bright side, I suppose, I didn't notice her scooting at all the day before I took her to the vet and she was acting normally, and ever since the vet visit, she hasn't scooted, but I think that's because she's pretty much been in hiding since then.",aspiring_trash17,2022-11-28,11:27:54,2022,11,28,11,27,Monday
1,CatAdvice,What could this be?,"Right now he is poorly (possible Giardia) but I've noticed for a while even before he was poorly he does these like involuntary muscle spasms. He seems to only do them lying down. And not all the time. he twitches in his sleep but I'm not worried about that. 

It's honestly small little like moments where he tenses then releases. I mean he's doing them right now while purring away. Other times he does it when he's laying on his own. Doesn't seem to matter what he's doing. They are minor movement his leg kinda moves a little, and I can see him generally tense a little but most seems to happen in the legs. Doesn't seem in pain or anything. 

He will lay there and do this for probably like 10 mins, every tense is like a few seconds apart. He seems unbuffered by it.",Particular-Ad3636,2022-11-28,11:24:54,2022,11,28,11,24,Monday

1,CatAdvice,Discouraging stray cat from bothering the neighbors,"I've been taking care of a young stray?/feral? cat for nearly 2 months, including one weekend when he got into my apartment and refused to leave for a while. After he finally went back out but tried to get back in again, I was hoping to adopt him but my landlord has said I can't have a pet indoors, then conceded that I could keep feeding it outside.  I'm still pretty heartbroken about it. 

I've got the cat booked for neutering soon, but no shelters will take him due to a combination of overcrowding and his lack of socialization. No vets will even look at him beyond neutering him (which sucks because he's got a weird spot that I want checked out, but that's a whole other problem). None of my friends who foster unsocialized cats can take him yet. I was advised by someone at one of the really good shelters nearby to keep working with him outside in hopes of getting him into adoptable condition by the time they have an opening for him. So the poor little guy is kind of stuck in this situation for now. 

Even though the landlord said I could keep an outdoor cat, recent changes he (the landlord) has made to the property have made the cat prefer to spend most of its time on the new neighbors' property. The landlord installed a panel over the crawlspace under our porch and we found fur stuck to it, suggesting that the cat had tried to squeeze through the panel. We built the cat an outdoor shelter, but it turns out the neighbors have a hole under their porch so the cat prefers it to the shelter. *Sometimes* the neighbors put food near the hole, so they know about him but I don't think they're friends with him the way I am. He also tears open their trash bags to forage through them and leaves a huge mess on their walkway, and he uses some old rubbish on that property as his personal gym. We had bushes that birds hung out in that the cat used to like to watch, but now the landlord has cut them down. The landlord has also put up a giant fence around half the property. 

The cat comes to me when called, usually crossing the neighbors' yard to do so, but now that it's cold, he doesn't want to hang out as much and goes back to the neighbors' house after his meals. I give him a pretty regular food supply, I've put catnip on his stuff here, and I got him one of those little microwavable cat shelter heaters, but after a few minutes he still prefers the safety and spaciousness of being under their porch. He used to show signs of feeling safe with me on our porch, but lately he has  become very jumpy and his socialization progress has regressed a little. 

I'm really worried that the new neighbors are going to get fed up with him. But since my landlord is adamant that the cat cannot be inside and since the cat can't access our crawlspace anymore, I don't know what to do to get him to stay on this property. 

Anyone have any ideas of how to encourage him to stay on this property, or is that fool's errand with strays in winter?",cheeruphamlet,2022-11-28,08:39:46,2022,11,28,8,39,Monday

1,CatAdvice,Finally decided to rehome our boy. Been crying all day.,"I wasn’t sure what else to do. Our sweet Yui boy is five, and was wonderful until we had our daughter. However, we tried again and again to get them to connect. For two years now. She is gentle (I’m a stay at home mom and I monitor their interactions, and taught her to pet and not grab his tail or hit). 

He has scratched her eye twice just by her bending down. He has clawed her legs when she walks by, drawing blood. We cannot keep them separated, as we live in a single family home. Our other cat runs away from her (she is old and skittish). Yui attacks. He has even attacked us, because he wants outside. In city limits, we can’t keep him outside.

We have tried keeping them separated, spraying with water, giving him alone time and more cuddles. Nothing is working, and our second baby will be here in early June. This is NOT a case of rehoming home because we are having another. This is, he is stressed, and these scratches (especially near the eye) can be dangerous. 

People think I haven’t tried every other options. I’ve exhausted them all. I’m gutted. He’s going to miss us, my daughter is going to wonder where he went. I’ve been crying all day. I don’t know if he’ll get as much love and treats. I just need to do what’s best for Yui and our kiddos. 

Everyone reaching out has just sent a barrage of attacks. It’s the last thing I need.

They are still learning how to set boundaries with each other and this is a boundary I am fearful of them learning the hard way. They don't growl when they play with each other. It's just when she has a toy in her mouth. I know it's a sign to stay away. The sister doesn't know that. My instinct is to protect the one that just wants to play but I want to do it in a healthy way.

1,CatAdvice,Unsure how to proceed with socializing rescued feral cat,"I rescued a young cat back in late October, and they still don't accept being touched. They take food from me as long as it's not directly from my hand (I can place it on the floor or near them, for example) and use all of the amenities provided (food, water, beds, litter) just fine, I can even sit close while they eat and we exchange slow blinks on occasion, but if I reach out with my hand they shy away from it. Which is fine, this was a completely feral cat that may or may not have seen the less kind side of humans while on the streets. 

Now, onto the question at hand: I've been keeping them in a very isolated room, and I only visit for a few minutes 3 times a day. My longest visit is about half an hour long, for dinner time. This seemed like the best idea at first because they were completely feral and not even used to being indoors, and I wanted to give them time to get comfy and decompress, but now it feels like we're stalling and I'm wondering if it would be a good idea to take the cat into my own bedroom, with the idea of getting them used to constant human presence and occasional interaction. Would this be too aggressive of a move? Should I just try to make my visits longer instead?",CreakingFloorboards,2022-11-28,04:56:27,2022,11,28,4,56,Monday

She will chase her away from the primary water and food bowl (luckily we have multiple locations for these). But the biggest problem is the litter boxes. We have 3 cats and 5 litter boxes spread out through the levels of our house (some in the basement, some on the main floor). It doesn’t matter what litter box our older cat tries to use. The younger cat will stalk and try to chase her out of the litter box. Of course this is stressing out our older cat and she is going places outside of these litter box locations to feel safe. I’ve always had multiple cats and have never had this problem. What can I do besides move the younger cat exclusively to the basement?",Witchy_Underpinnings,2022-11-28,02:30:27,2022,11,28,2,30,Monday

What are my options for keeping their food separate?  

I've seen the chipped feeders that only open for the right cat but isn't that only one or two meals at a time? That wont be enough for some of my trips that are up to 5 days.

1,CatAdvice,has anybody had an experience with giardia in cats?,"a cat i adopted a few weeks ago turned out to have giardia from the sanctuary she was in and i am not sure how to proceed. everything the vet suggested to get her to take the meds was to no avail, and i'm expected to go back in for them to show me how to pill her but i've already tried myself and it's definitely something i cannot do by myself. my other concern is that i heard it's a very stubborn virus and cleaning all the places she nests in every single day is not exactly possible, not to mention washing her bottom after defecating sounds like an impossible feat. would it be acceptable to ask the sanctuary from where i adopted her to care for her until she is treated, given that they are obviously a lot more experienced than i, and especially since they knew and didn't tell me. it is either that or, if possible to have her stay at the vet clinic which would probably be way above my budget. my second concern is realistically how easy is it to completely cure giardia, as i have heard some people dealing with it for months. thanks!",aImondss,2022-11-28,01:07:35,2022,11,28,1,7,Monday

1,CatAdvice,my cat keeps stealing,"i got him when he was around 2 months old. my friend found him and i decided to take him in cause she couldn't let him stay. he was always a rather small cat, although he wasn't underweight. he's about a year and 3 months old now and at a healthy weight. it started with food, he'd steal absolutely anything that was left unattended, break into the trash can and eat food out of it, we installed locks and after a ton of time the problem stopped. obviously, we still had to hide everything, because otherwise he'll just eat it all, but he left the trash bin alone. however, not only was he stealing food, but anything that would cause us to get mad or worried, really.  he stole my vitamins and got into my antidepressants a few times, but  thank god he never ate any of it. still, the problem got so worrying recently that we hide my meds in a drawer now.  he gets into some of my drawers and cabinets and steals small stuff from it, like a toy my friend crocheted for me. some time ago he started opening the fridge. it is old and we surely have to get a new one, cause it causes some problems but ffs, how is a cat smart enough to open a fridge? he literally broke the seal at night, this night, and ate almost a whole sausage my parents bought, and the foil it was covered in too. i am mad worried at this point, firstly, because i have no idea what to do, secondly, i'm afraid that he'll get seriously damaged after eating something. don't get me wrong, we try to hide ALL food. but it's freaking impossible to keep all of it away from his sight. and i don't think its normal that he doesn't give up on stealing EVER... also, we feed him 5 times a day.  p.s this is not the only annoying thing he does, cause he tends to be aggressive sometimes, especially towards my mom. i'd think it's just him playing but sometimes he just attacks her and won't let her go. i seriously don't know what to do, if i should play with him more, or something, cause i'm just hopeless. if i forgot to mention anything then just ask me in the comments and i'll provide the info lol. i seriously love him so much but it's just unbearable and atp i'm scared that my parents will get completely fed up cause i can see that they're both stressed and i don't know what to do",happysvgarlife,2022-11-27,21:41:36,2022,11,27,21,41,Sunday

1,CatAdvice,Wishing to adopt a stray cat,"Hiya 

I have a stray cat that frequently hangs out in my garden. I have put up several posters in the area to see if she belongs to anyone and have not received anything back so far. For the past 3 weeks, I have been feeding her and she has been sleeping in my garden. I bought her a cat bed and she seems to enjoy the space. The problem I am having is she is incredibly skittish- she will not let me approach her to pet her or even just stand next to her. I worry as it is cold outside and I really want to check if she is ok and take her to a vet to see if she has been microchipped etc. I don't own any pets and am wondering if there is a way to get her to trust me. I have tried to bribe her with food, catnip, and toys but nothing seems to be working. Any ideas would be incredibly helpful. I want her to be able to trust me and if she does not have an owner I am looking to adopt. I do not know if this is helpful to anyone but a lot of people seem to this she is a British shorthair cat and she is fairly big so I think an adult but I don't know her age.",A1234910,2022-11-27,21:25:10,2022,11,27,21,25,Sunday
1,CatAdvice,New kitten - Overwhelmed by feelings,"I adopted a 4 month old kitten yesterday, It was a hard decision but I thought it would help with my depression - and also because I miss my cat and rabbit from my parent’s home.
I brought him home by train and metro.
He was very quiet for 30 minutes and the next half hour he started meowing on the train. Tears came to my eyes, he was staring at me with his beautiful big eyes while meowing. He will miss his family (and his brother).

Once at home I locked myself in the bathroom with him, I put a pillow under the radiator, and gave him something to eat and drink. I spent two hours sitting on the floor with him, petting him, letting him explore and watching him sleep. Then I let him discover the kitchen and the main room.
He ended up eating, drinking and doing his business in his litter box. When I went to bed he came to snuggle with me, then he stuck to my face. I turned my back and he went to sleep on the sofa.

Everything is going well, only I feel bad. I have no appetite, my nose and throat are a little blocked (I had a cat and a rabbit at my parents' house for 18 years and never had any allergies). I am sensitive to the smell of cat drool when he plays, try to lick my nose. And also he leaves small deposits of fecal matter where he sits (sofa, cat tree, my sheets) probably microscopic but I can smell it. This kitten is clean though.

So here I am with all these feelings. 

He seems quite happy in my apartment, he purrs a lot and asks to play and cuddle. 
I'm afraid to leave him alone during the day for 9 hours, I'm afraid he'll do something bad / get bored.
For the moment I have only one toy, a thing with feathers, but I am afraid that he will ingest it by chewing on it.

I don’t feel like he should sleep in the corridor and not in the main room with me because it would be lonely somehow. But I dont want him IN my bed nor pillow. Only ON my bed would be ok tho.",VixCait,2022-11-27,21:15:23,2022,11,27,21,15,Sunday

1,CatAdvice,Coping with separation anxiety (?),"Hey y'all, I was wondering if you could give me some advice for my kitty. 

So, I have an upcoming 1 week trip this January. Since my cat hasn't had any experience being left alone for extended periods, I went out of town this weekend and hired a catsitter. The sitter is great, my cat warmed up to her. I have a camera in my apartment to keep an eye on her.

The problem is, my cat has been sitting in front of the door all night waiting for me to come home 🥲 She hasn't moved at all. She's eating ok though and used the litter box ok, but it just breaks my heart seeing her just sitting there. I used the audio on the camera once to tell her it's ok, but she just looked around confused and it was so heartbreaking I didn't do it again 🥲🥲🥲 Help! 

Also, she is in fospice care with me (terminal cancer) so I can't get a companion cat (and she doesn't do well with other cats). I also don't want to put her in a cat hotel.

At the same day my cat got home, a family member brought in a stray kitten. 

2 days ago, i started to introduce my cat to the kitten. They look like they’re fine together so i let them be together without my watch (I’m sorry). I always leave dry food in the bowl so if they’re hungry, they can just eat. My cat seems weary (?) of the kitten so I’m not sure if he’s eating. 
Later that night, my cat started to sneeze from time to time. 

Yesterday, i let him hang out with the kitten downstairs again. I’m not sure if he’s eating the dry food (I’m sorry again). But he refused to eat the wet food. And his poop is watery.

Today, he looks like he wants to eat but didn’t eat. And his poop is watery too. He looks really tired too. 

Could it be because of stress or health problems? I’m sorry if I look irresponsible. First time taking care of a neutered cat and introducing a new kitten.

1,CatAdvice,New &amp; old cat slowing getting along until a fight and neighbour feeds old cat and let's in their house.,"Hello, so I've had my male cat T for 13 years, he's still very healthy and active for his age. My friend moved abroad last year and I took in his female cat J 1 year old. They're indoor/outdoor cats in a very cat friendly environment.

T had always been the only cat. After months of slowly introducing them to each other following the standard procedure. They were kind of getting along until one day they had a fight and over the next week T wasn't eating when he came in. Over the next few weeks he stopped coming in  to eat and coming back at all, maybe 1 night a week. It was obvious someone was feeding him. Now 8 weeks later, I've had to work extra hours with the weather getting worse I know T would be sleeping all day. But now I know which neighbour has been looking after him I don't know what to do.

Do I ask them to just stop feeding or stop feeding and not let him in (I know that would upset him as he doesn't want to come home at the minute anyway) while I try to reintroduce the cats? Or should I get him in and keep him locked in for a week (I have a week off before xmas)  and try to get them comfortable with each other again? 

He's obviously happy round my neighbours, if they stop feeding and I keep him in for a while but things don't work I don't want to cause him to be stressed.",Gammabrunta,2022-11-27,19:19:07,2022,11,27,19,19,Sunday

She was sent to the rescue after her last owner passed. Due to her previous experience with multiple owners and fosters, it takes her a while to warm up to people and she gets scared easily. But once she trusts a person, she turns into such a lovely cat.

And then there is a 1 year old female cat we recently adopted. 
The new cat’s background/personality:
She was a stray cat and was rescued with her little kittens 2-3 months before we adopted her.
She loves attention and food. She constantly purrs, meows, kneads and rubs her face against anyone’s hand. She seemed to be okay around other cats when we went to the rescue centre to see her.


It has been 6 weeks since we brought the new cat home, and they HATE each other.
Here is what’s been going on. (Sorry this is a lot of details)

- When we brought the new cat home, we had our office room ready for her with a litter box, food bowl, cat bed, cat tree, etc. We didn’t let them see each other but let them smell each other through the door. We fed them together (with the door closed) so they can associate food to each other’s smell. The resident cat was quite anxious and hissing a lot. She wasn’t even comfortable passing that door. But over time, she has gotten better and now she can tolerate eating 2 feet away from the door. (But she still hisses and runs off after finishing her food.)

- We have been keeping the new cat in the office room, and the resident cat in the bedroom. They take turns to explore around the house throughout the day. We usually sleep with the resident cat, but I have been sleeping with the new cat in the office room because she meows so much.


- On our week 2, they ran into each other. (My partner just open the office room to see the new cat, and she just ran downstairs to the kitchen) There was no hissing or any interactions other than eye-contact. (But there was a bit of screaming from their humans…)

- On our week 3,  they ran into each other again. (My partner just opened the bedroom door without knowing the new cat was right behind him) And the new cat just straight up attacked the resident cat who was sleeping next to me. The resident cat was absolutely terrified. There was chunks of hair in the new cat’s paws :(

- We let them see each other through a babygate. My partner was on the resident cat’s side and I was on the new cat’s side. The resident cat was 10 feet away from the babygate, hiding under a chair. After a few stares, the new cat attempted to climb the babygate. There were some hissing and howling. We ended the session after that.

- We also got a huge playpen(tent) and installed it in the living room. At first we tried keeping the new cat in the tent all day and let the resident cat approach her when she feels comfortable. For the first 2 days, the resident cat didn’t even come downstairs. On the third day, she came downstairs but when she came closer to the tent, the new cat tried to attack her.


And now we are on week 7. We’ve watched a lot of youtube videos and read many articles, tried calming treats and all different types of Feliway plugins as well. I am so lost and beginning to wonder if it’s time for me to give up. I feel like I’m just torturing the cats and ourselves.

I have many friends who have cats but never heard of any failure stories… Do people often give up on cat introductions? If I continue this, would they eventually get along?

1,CatAdvice,"New kitten came with blanket and toys with previous owner's scents, won't stop meowing","Hi, I just had a 4.5 months old kitten today, he's adjusting to the environment and to me very well but still show signs of nervous and stress(he hides under my bed and half the time whenever he doesn't feel safe) but he's gotten on my lap, desk, bed and loves getting pet and eat/drinks no problem on day one.

Now, he came with a blanket and bunch of toys from his old house, whenever I take out his old toys and he plays with it by himself he wouldn't stop meowing for a long time. This doesn't happen with any other toys I bought. Does this mean he misses his old house/family, meowing because he's playing with it by himself or just stress/nerves?",ryuuyr,2022-11-27,13:13:40,2022,11,27,13,13,Sunday

1,CatAdvice,how long should i expect my cat to hate my new kitten for?,"my 6 month old female orange tabby hates my new 4 month old kitty. she constantly tries to attack her if she can see her, which isn’t often because they are kept in separate rooms 24/7, but when we open the door with new kitty, orange kitty sometimes tried to rush in and she’ll go for the kill if she gets the chance. 
relevant info - we’ve had orange kitty since she was 8 weeks old. we’ve had new kitty for 3 weeks. like i said, they’re kept in separate rooms all the time but if they hear each other meow they’ll both stick their paws under the door and “play.” new kitty is not aggressive or scared of orange kitty. new kitty is spayed, orange kitty is set to be spayed first week of december. separate food, water and litter boxes for each. orange kitty is typically affectionate and playful. when she senses new kitty (smell, sight, or hears her) she is aggressive towards us briefly. we bought a barrier for the door so they can see each other but have no physical contact and orange kitty will run full force at it if she sees new kitty, so we keep the door closed nearly all the time anyway unless we can pay full attention to them bc we’re scared she’ll break through and attack new kitty. we gave orange kitty more treats, love and active play time for the first week in hopes she’d associate a new kitty with a better life, but now she’s treated the same as before. my partner and i take turns sleeping on the couch since they have to be kept in separate rooms, and if orange kitty doesn’t have access to us she gets very distressed and will meow and scratch at the door all night.",raineray,2022-11-27,12:34:52,2022,11,27,12,34,Sunday

They got into a bunch of minor fights, but the last one she nicked  his nose a tiny tiny bit and he has been terrified of her ever since. So, for the past 7 months I’ve had them separated.

1,CatAdvice,Rescue cat hates me still after a week. Looking for advice to get her to warm up to me,"Took in a stray cat about a week ago. I had been feeding her daily for about 2 years. Im wondering if i made the wrong decision taking her in. I just don't want her to freeze to death or get hit by a car or get into fights with other cats ive seen roaming the area. I'm willing to work with her as long as it takes. 

Things i have done, most of which came from cat advice channels on youtube

She went to the vet for a checkup/shots when i first trapped her.

Made her a special private room with a bed near a window, built her a carpeted box to hide/sleep in.

Removed most hiding places in the room except ones i created for her to keep her from secluding her self. I was letting her roam between rooms but found a video that said i should keep her in one room and just hang out in there.

I bought some catnip spray and sprayed it on her toys but she doesn't use them. I tried staying in the room when i fed her but she won't eat if im in there.

I clean her litter box every day sometimes more than once a day. I put on gloves and sprayed them with catnip to try and coax her into letting me at least get my hand near her and she runs off or if i get too close hisses. I slow blink and stay low to the ground to try and not appear like a threat. 

I know these things can take months or longer, i just want to make sure im doing everything i can and make sure im not doing things wrong.

1,CatAdvice,Advice? (Lengthy read),"Hey guys! 
I need some advice &amp; was hoping to maybe get some feedback before Monday for the sake of my nerves. 

I have a 9 year old cat (Baylor) &amp; he recently came down with a super nasty cough, so I took him to the vet. It was an absolute nightmare &amp; he screamed/relieved himself the entire time he was in the back getting treated. I think (no, I know) he traumatized a beagle named Ralphie as well as 2 other cats &amp; a rabbit. The pigeons resting on the power lines outside probably sought out therapy because of what they heard. It was awful… anyways… 
He was also due for his yearly vaccines, so the vet decided to administer his antibiotics/steroids/vaccines all at once. The alternative was to put him through a 2nd trip &amp; sedate him, but he thought that would be more traumatic than just doing it all at once, so that’s what we did. That’s been 10 days ago exactly, &amp; his vet said the antibiotics would stay in his system for 2 weeks (if that’s relevant). 

Post-vet trip, he definitely didn’t feel well, but that was expected &amp; within 2 days his cough was gone &amp; he’d perked back up. While he was still recovering though, he stayed pretty much under our bed the entire time with the exception to eat &amp; potty. It’s worth noting (I think) that we recently moved in July &amp; our bedroom has carpet, which is something he’s never laid on before. I only mention that because I feel like it’s possible that the reason he is still staying under the bed is because it’s a new hiding spot he discovered that made him feel “safe” while he was feeling sick and plus it’s warm (I’m in KY so winter is settling in). 

But that’s what I need advice on - he’s still under the bed &amp; comes out pretty much never. For a few days he was out &amp; about more often than he is now. Idk. 
He’ll come downstairs &amp; meow for treats, but right back upstairs he goes straight under the bed. 
I have noticed that while he’s still using the litter box, there are a couple drops of pee (likes he’s dribbled) outside the box; however, we have another cat &amp; he’s a hot mess - he’s the messiest litter box user in all the land, so idk that it isn’t him. 

Anyways, he acts 100% normal, he looks normal in the eyes, when I check on him he’s responsive &amp; seems coherent, he just seems to have no desire to leave his little nest under the bed. 
Which, I have no issues with him being under there, so long as he’s okay. 

I’m calling his vet Monday, but was hopeful for some feedback before then. 
I hate to put him back through it because he’ll have to be sedated before they’ll work with him, especially if it’s unnecessary. Jeeze. 

Anyways - thank you for your feedback!

1,CatAdvice,What is cat Minoxidil exposure symptoms and how much time needed to watch,"First of all, I apologize for my poor English skills.

Hi, I applied minoxidil to my hair for the first time about eight hours ago.

The environment applied was a toilet where cats are not allowed in, and after applying it, I sat down and started working. About 3 hours ago(4-5 hours after applying minoxidill, I was looking for information about minoxidil and read that it is fatal to cats.

After applying minoxidil, the cats did not touch my hair part or face directly, but I was afraid that they might have come into contact with the residue in my hand, so I washed my hands and wiped them around their bodies with a wet tissue(had no shampoo left for them)

I also took a shower and washed all the minoxidil that was left in my body, changed my clothes,, opened the window of the room where I was sitting, ventilated while them not allowed in

Just now writing this article, the cats are playing well, eating well, going to toilet well, etc. I can not see any symptoms but still I am worried and will watch the whole night.(sadly vet is closed in my time here)

If cats have been exposed to minoxidil, please give me a detailed description of what symptoms can develop in a few hours at most, and how many hours I should watch over them, thanks for help",Heydrich_S,2022-11-27,06:05:44,2022,11,27,6,5,Sunday

1,CatAdvice,Cat licks my hair,"Hi everyone! I adopted my cat (3F) about two months ago.

I keep it there to lean on when I'm reading in bed so I don't actually use it when I'm sleeping.

The issue is that it puts her over my head, and when I'm falling asleep I've caught her a few times licking my hair, like she's trying to groom me. I don't care about this but I'm worried she's going to swallow hair and it'll cause issues for her, digestively. I have pretty long hair, it's dyed but otherwise I don't put products in it before bed, besides shampoo and conditioner from the shower. Could this make her sick, or give her issues with digestion?

1,CatAdvice,Is it okay to feed my cats once a day?,"Okay for context both my cats are two years old. I had them since kittens and i used to feed them 3 times a day. 6am then 2pm and then 930pm.

 As they got older i switched it to twice a day
630am and 930pm. Both adjusted quick but one cat my calico took a little longer to get used to the new schedule but it was no longer than a few days extra than my other cat. 

Now i feed them once a day at night 930pm but i feed them the same amount of food as i always have but just all at night. They have no problems eating, no vomit, and they are very active after eating which is fine. 

But my concern and i guess annoyance is my calico again is having trouble adjusting. She bothers all day meowing at me for food. Every morning she still thinks shes getting fed and throws a fit. By a fit i just mean meowing at me constantly as i get ready for work at 5am. Its been nearly two weeks now and she hasn’t adjusted to her new feeding schedule. My other cat has and she has no problem. Again i feed them the same amount of food just all at night. Its wet canned food. 
Their weight is healthy as well so i know my calico isn’t starving. 

Is it okay to feed them once a day? How can i help my calico get adjusted to this new feeding schedule? Itd help me alot because well its no fun being meowed at all day for food lol she gets my other cat anxious thinking its food time soon or something.",SignificantDrawing39,2022-11-27,04:23:26,2022,11,27,4,23,Sunday

1,CatAdvice,Dealing with a rescue cat my dog hates,"I rescued an injured semi-feral cat about 6 weeks ago. She is very shy with everyone else but a complete lap cat with me. The problem is that my 15 year old dog is not adjusting. I’ve followed all the advice I’ve found online and it’s not getting any better. 

The main issue is that the cat and dog both want to be with me. I have a large 2 story house and plenty of room. I’ve bought toys, beds, and a cat tree to keep downstairs in hopes of encouraging the cat to stay down there but she insists on being in my room and will cry outside the door if it is shut. I’ve ignored her but I have to sleep at some point so it’s getting tough. I’ve tried to find her another home but all the rescues are full.

My last option is to put her into the guest room downstairs and just try to visit her when I can but I feel really guilty keeping her locked up. Does anyone have any suggestions of ways to make this work? It’s worth noting that the cat is mostly unbothered by my dog barking and growling and will chose to go under my bed or climb on my desk rather than retreating to one of the many safe spaces I’ve set up for her.",Ok-Introduction-470,2022-11-27,01:25:40,2022,11,27,1,25,Sunday

1,CatAdvice,Need help balancing meals for two cats,"I have two cats with extremely different eating habits and I'm not sure how to make sure one of them is eating a healthy amount. I've had one of the cats for almost eight years now (he'll be 8 in a couple months) and he's always been a grazer. He'll eat just a little bit at a time and likes having food in his bowl all day. Several months ago we got a new kitten, he's 11 months old now and is a little food crazy. If food is left out he'll eat it all. This has led to him eating too much food, and my older cat not getting enough and losing some weight. 

I tried giving the older cat wet food at night (along with the dry food during the day) but he rarely eats it all. I've tried ~10 different wet foods and there's only been one kind that he'd eat a whole can of (smaller cans not big ones) but that only lasted about a week before he didn't want it anymore. 

I'm trying to feed them in separate rooms, but my older cat just barely eats any food! I worry I won't be able to break his habit of wanting to eat little bits at a time.

I'm looking for advice on any other ways I could help my cat eat more in one sitting, or some foods with higher protein/calories that could be better for him to eat if he's going to eat such a small amount at a time. Or ways I could get the younger cat to graze on the food as well instead of stuffing himself with any food in sight lol. But I'm worried that would be a much harder behavior to change.",vegananimetitties,2022-11-26,22:55:44,2022,11,26,22,55,Saturday

However, today he moved his blanket off his bed and weed on the heating pad there. We aren't sure why this is and what to do from here, I was thinking maybe he's been getting anxious since he was alone while he did this and when he can't see people around he sometimes cries and we have to call him and he will come running. Overall he's a bit more dog like in how he likes company. 

I've also checked on him whilst he's using his tray and he doesn't seem to be in any pain or have difficulty using his tray when he goes. Does anyone have any idea what this could be?",Neo-N1,2022-11-26,22:12:59,2022,11,26,22,12,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,Is an apartment life good for my cat?,"Hey, 

My cat was a stray. I adopted her a year ago. We lived in a cottage with plenty of enclosed lawn area where dogs didn't get in. She does roam outside the area. 

We are considering moving to a new place. There are 3 bedroom (2 washroom) and it's on the ground floor. There are other building around too. And the main problem is that there person next door has an agressive dog. I don't think they let him out. But we are not sure of that. Plus there are community strays around the area. 

Is it a good idea to move in and keep her as a fully indoor cat? 

Best case scenario would be that they neighbor will keep their dog inside so she can roam around. But I think its most likely that we should keep her as a completely indoor cat. 

I am just worried that since she liked to spend time in the lawn and roam around she will be stressed in the new home.

1,CatAdvice,why aren't my cats getting along,"I have 2 cats, both between 1-2 years old, female, fixed, and from the same breeder (but different litters). The first is a grey tabby named Whisper, and the second is a calico named Calypso. They usually get along fine, sure they might get upset with each other every now and then, but they are usually over it with a day, maybe 2, and can be seen snuggling with and cleaning each other less than a week later. But recently Calypso has been growling? (Not really growling but I can't think of a better word for it) and hissing any time Whisper is nearby. It's been going on for a few days now and I just heard a scuffle an entered the dining room to see Calypso on the table hissing at Whisper who was on a chair looking at her. Whisper never growls or hisses at Calypso (even in previous fights) and doesn't even seem concerned when they are in the same room whereas Calypso won't take her eyes off Whisper for more than 20 seconds and is constantly making noise if she can even smell her.

1,CatAdvice,"Suggestions for kitten toys? ~6 mo twins, active kitten loves shredding blinds and is causing lots of damage!","Hi y'all! Adopted two fluffy Siamese mix sisters in June, everything pretty smooth except we're struggling to provide enough play for one of them. Wisp is a very active kitty who loves hunting and fighting and biting, she definitely has her snuggly moments and loves us and her sister but has sooo much energy. It's proving difficult to keep her focused on toys for longer periods of time, once she gets bored of playing with a toy and we stop, she immediately starts to attack stuff in the house. 

The blinds are a big issue accelerating our need for toys because she is systemically destroying them. Every window blind has pieces missing and we're increasingly afraid that our landlord will take notice of it if she continues. Keeping them rolled up isn't feasible as we're visible for anyone coming in the apartment building due to our apt placement. Curtains are against the lease terms unfortunately too.

Getting her redirected to toys is just getting harder with time. If anyone can suggest toys that might scratch this itch for her please let me know!! Anything work for your cats? Got any ideas that might fit what she needs? I'm running low on ideas. Details on what we've learned so far:

What she seems to enjoy is being able to reach/jump up and hunt things above her. The blinds are heavenly, she also climbed and ripped apart a small potted tree. Climbing it and hunting the leaves as they shook in response to her climbing was irresistible. She got bored when the leaves were all ripped off and the thin trunk was bent sideways so climbing wasn't very good.

I have a tall tower scratcher, medium height cat tree with 3 tallish levels, and a dangling bungee toy attached to a doorway arch. They just can't compete with the sweet sweet blinds. Other toys she likes but can't focus on anymore are the little plastic springs to hunt, and feather/ribbon bird on a wand. If these fail to work for short play sessions I don't know what we'll do to entertain her anymore haha.",coldsnaps,2022-11-26,16:10:49,2022,11,26,16,10,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,Advice on my cat using her paws to eat wet food,"Alright, well like the title says, my 4 y/o cat has developed a habit of sticking/dipping/spooning out her food with her paws. 

She’s always been a bit quirky, and I discovered quickly after I adopted her at 3 months, that if I gave her wet food without mashing it up completely with water into a thinner paste/soup, that she would just grab chunks and pull them on the floor. She also ate her dry food so fast that I had to buy her a slow feeder.

She’s done well with adjustments I made according to her weird habits  and I haven’t really had issues until a few months ago when I noticed she was using her paws to scoop out her wet food and either lick it off her paws, or eat it off the ground.

I thought maybe the dish we had was too deep and narrow and it was hurting her whiskers to use that bowl, so I bought bowls that are flat and wide. Unfortunately it hasn’t helped and I’m running out of ideas. I’ve even put down a mat to help curb messes.

I’m now thinking that maybe I should get an elevated pet bowl to see if it’s more to do with the discomfort of eating from a bowl on the floor.

I’m wondering if anyone else has dealt with this sort of problem before and what things were tried and what worked.

I’m just worried because she’ll jump straight from her litter and then use her paws to eat. I can’t imagine that’s good for her :( not to mention I obviously don’t want my cat eating straight off the floor. Sometimes I step in food without realizing and she’ll just eat that too. Or she’ll eat random hair and then have hairball issues that she’s already prone to.

One other weird food bowl issue I’ve also noticed recently is that she sometimes gets in this obsessive mindset of trying to bury her food. Of course she cannot dig into my floor, she she ends up scratching around her bowl until sometimes she tips it over. I have her food dish as far from her litterbox as I can have it, because I’ve read that sometimes cat’s will want to bury their scent and of course a kill/eating area is something cats would want to coverup from predators or other cats.

I know it’s a lot of info, but I’m hoping someone will have gone through something similar and can give me ideas that I haven’t tried.",RaedynFae,2022-11-26,15:29:39,2022,11,26,15,29,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,How to change my cat habit to wake me up at 6am?,"When I first got my cat, a year and half ago, I made a critical mistake: I gave her kibble each morning, when I woke up.
After a few months, when I noticed she was waking me up to demand her food, I stopped doing that, and gave her food each evening instead. 

The problem is, she never unlearned this habit, and since then wake me up nearly each morning at 4-6 am. 
She is very demanding, purring, licking, climbing me, and above all, the dreadfully ""paw in the eye"" maneuver!
She is relentless, until I'm up and about, then she will go eat without further problem and let me go back to sleep (if I manage to...)

Some details:

She have a tower feeder.  Each evening I put enough kibble for 24h. So she have far enough kibble in the tower for her morning meal. 

She know how to feed herself from the tower, and doesn't need me. She just wait until I'm up and in the same room as the feeder to do it... I don't even have to approach the feeder, just being in the same room... 

To be more precise, there is a stair leading to the main room. 
If I am on the last step of the stair, she will wait, keep peace between the feeder and me, prodding me to continue. 
If I make one more step to be in the room, she will be content and eat, I'm not needed anymore..

My apartment is really open, with no door that I could use to prevent her from sleeping with me and walking me up (and I like the fact that she sleep with me every night)

Do you have any idea how I could make her unlearn this bad habit of her? I'd like to get a good night of sleep sometimes!",Icebird-99,2022-11-26,14:10:57,2022,11,26,14,10,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,"Single Cat Syndrome with adult cat, need help","My cat (2.5y neutered female) I adopted as a sole kitten. I just very recently learned about single Kitten Syndrome and feel so guilty for adopting her alone and feel like her quality of life is so low because she doesn’t have a friend. My sister has two cats but we’ve tried for over a year to slowly socialize them together and it is absolutely not working. When they have accidentally gotten at each other with no cage, My cat will run after them and pounce on them when their social cues indicate they don’t want that. My sister is very well versed in cat care so we have been taking all the proper steps to try and socialize them slowly but she just won’t reduce her aggression. I think she’s trying to play but they perceive it as an attack - which it pretty much is. 

I really want to help her overcome this, as she’s going to be without me soon when I go off to college next summer. I want her to have someone else to play with besides my dad and sister because they are busy people. I also would like her to be able to move from my dads house with me eventually and I don’t feel comfortable with her being away from our remote area with no other outdoor cats. My ultimate goal is for her to be able to be more of an indoor cat (I’m aware of the ethical and environmental problems with indoor/outdoor cats which is why I want her to get more stimulation within the home so she doesn’t crave the outdoors so much). My question currently is: Would it be a good idea to get her her own kitten friend? The reason I think it might be better is because my sisters cats are heavily bonded and are already afraid of her. I don’t see them warming up to her anytime soon. I thought maybe it would be a good idea to teach her to socialize appropriately on her own new friend, maybe a kitten because she might be more gentle with it? I just want her to be happy without having to be outside most of the day, and I wish this wasn’t a problem I love her so much and want her to have cat friends to play with. Please be gentle about this I am already so anxious about her and her happiness i shame myself so much for this. Please let me know if this would be a good idea and if you have any other suggestions.

We took him to the vet today for an exam &amp; vaccinations. We scheduled his neuter for December 12. The vet estimates that he’s around a year old.

He’s healthy overall but tested positive for roundworms- not surprising since he’s lived outdoors for most of his life. We have him quarantined in our climate controlled garage so he is warm and safe. My question is - how long until the worms are gone? I’m ready to bring him into live with us but we have 2 cats and we don’t want to spread worms. 

Thanks I’m advance! I forgot to ask the vet today. He had a meltdown as soon as we went toward the car. Once we got into the vet he peed and pooped in his carrier and was almost inconsolable. I can’t help but think he remembers being dumped on the side of the road. He loves us so much and I hate having to keep him separated.",sndidat28,2022-11-26,11:05:32,2022,11,26,11,5,Saturday

Recently she’s been aggressive with me - this has been only following a specific incident. 

I blew a hiking safety whistle in the kitchen (just not thinking) and it triggered an “episode” where she started yowling at me, pupils dilated, and aggressively following me as I backed away from her until I could cordon her into a part of the house to calm down. (I had some gabepenton gave to her in food to help the calm) 

Since then there’s been multiple occasions where she though I was going to do that loud noise thing in the kitchen, and has began to do the same behaviours. 

The last two days in particular have been hellish because she mistook my being at the bench in the kitchen as a possible re-do, I caught her eye and noticed her pupils dilating and beginning to take the strange body language she displayed that night, and has been aggressive ever since. 

I thought the night would “reset” her to calm mode, but this morning she was on edge and not really comfortable as I moved about my morning duties, tentative and anxious, sharply observing me - I fed her and played for a while with her toy but noticed whenever I caught her eye her focus would be primarily on me and not the toy and I sensed it wouldn’t take much at all to set her off again. Cut to me making a tea in the kitchen, and she was at my feet, when I looked down and at her, the pupils went big again and she began her tense body and meowing, and as soon as I back away she yowls louder and it’s happening once again. 

I feel so guilty because she’s spend most of the last 36 hours or so blocked off in a small part of the house. I’m giving her the gabepenten in food serves to try and calm some of this - but I just feel awful, it’s a silly mistake I made one time, thats turned into what appears to be a trauma for her - as she already had a nervous disposition. Now our relationship has been severely impacted, the trust seems gone. I always appreciated that she was a cranky little defensive thing, but with me she was tolerant, and even sometimes, when I was lucky, loving and a lap cat etc. 

I’m terribly afraid of what’s going to happen at the vets - because the last few times I’ve brought her in, it’s basically been a costly bust, because they’re not willing to take her out of her cage (understandably) even with the gabepenton, so they’ve not been able to perform a full check. 

This time they say they’ll sedate her and check her ears because she’s been shaking her head frequently and seems bothered by her ears. (This also makes me feel awful because what if the whistle caused some damage!?) 

Anyways - now all the background has been provided - my question is - how do I make it through the next 3 days if her temperament remains on this level? Am I going to have to keep drugging her and sequestering her in small rooms until then, for my own safety? Isn’t that only going to cause her further trauma and distrust? 

Any tips on how to navigate such an aggressive frame of mind of hers until she can be seen to would be so very appreciated! Thank you if you’ve read all this!",unimaginablepotatoes,2022-11-26,10:55:17,2022,11,26,10,55,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,introduced new cat to 3 residents a few weeks ago... everything's gone great but as of yesterday the new cat and 1 of the 3 do NOT get along?,"I'm so confused. It took new kitty (Gus) a while to get comfortable, but it's now been a few weeks of them all mingling successfully without supervision needed! I have Gus and another boy, and they get along, they've started playing and everything, they also eat dinner side by side everyday. My roommate has two cats as well. 



Gus is a larger guy compared to two and the one he doesn't suddenly get along with (Soup) is definitely the biggest. Gus would still be on edge for a while while walking by Soup and would hiss and maybe swat if Soup got too close but that was it. 


Yesterday all of a sudden a cat fight broke out between the two while I was out of the house. My roommate described it to be pretty scary, and both of them were going toward one another... so we decided to keep Gus isolated in my room for the night, and just today I decided to let Gus out to see how it would go... and yes, the two went to fight again. I initially grabbed gus who was trying to get out of my arms and run away while Soup was climbing up me to attack. I then grabbed Soup who mauled up my arm while Gus ran away. 



I'm at a loss and I'm panicked. Rehoming isn't an option, and me and my roommate likely won't be living together much longer since I may be moving out of town. 



Does anyone had advice or any reasoning why this suddenly happened?",ru-ru-rudy,2022-11-26,08:56:18,2022,11,26,8,56,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,Cat play dates to keep cat socialized?,"I am cat sitting my neighbors cats for the rest of the year, my neighbor suggested I move in to her house and bring my cat since she knows my living space is kind of toxic. 

I have my cat currently over at my house and just go over to spend time with the other cats and feed them, since I’m worried to freak my cat out by moving her over there.

I have seen kitten play dates are a bad idea on here, I’m worried about the potential of her getting used to the new house then after this month moving back here to our house where her space would be reduced to one floor instead of three.

The plot also gets even more complicated when one of the cats I’m taking care of over there is one my neighbor is contemplating rehoming to me when I move out within the next year. So that would mean my cat would have to get used to and test it out to see if she likes him. But I don’t know if I should stress her out for such a short term thing, and I don’t plan to as of now. Just wondering if moving over there and getting her involved sounds like a good move. 


TLDR: Advice is welcomed. Cat sitting cats, one of whom I am potentially adopting. The plan right now is check in on the other kitties twice a day w feedings litter the whole nine yards, then come home to my kitty. Wondering if anyone ever brought their cats short term to somewhere else and had it work out well.",Imaginary_Love3307,2022-11-26,07:58:49,2022,11,26,7,58,Saturday
1,CatAdvice,first time travelling with kitten,"hi! i have a 3 month old kitten who has been with me for a month now and he is the first pet i’ve ever owned. i just want some advice about bringing him to my parents house over Christmas. 

he’s gotten so comfortable with me and my bf in such a short amount of time; he is confidently roaming our apartment and is very playful. it only took about a week for him to be ready to leave his safe room. even so, he’s still very cautious of everything and everyone, and seems very antisocial. he’s still not fully comfortable around our flatmate yet and when we had 2 of our friends friends over last week, he hid in his tower for 6 hours straight and refused to come out until they left. this has me worried about how he will react to travelling and staying in another house for a few days. 

i live in London and my parents house is about an hour and a half train journey away which isn’t too bad but i know he’s going to be stressed regardless. i’m afraid that when we get there, he will hide under the sofa the entire time and refuse to eat or something like that. we plan on bringing his toys, cat tree and bed with us so hopefully he will feel more at home. is there any i can further prepare for to make this whole situation easier?

ps. we will not be getting a cat sitter because no one we know is willing to take him during the Christmas period and understandably so.",juuliyan,2022-11-26,07:57:53,2022,11,26,7,57,Saturday
1,CatAdvice,Roommate's cat is stressing out my elderly cat,"Looking for advice! My cat recently moved to a new place, and she loved it until my new roommate moved in with her cat. Now, she spends all her time side-eying him on the couch away from everybody. She stopped sleeping in my bed because the couch is the only place he doesn't pester her as much. I took her to the vet and she's mostly fine (has a bit of a cold that we're working out as well as arthritis that is being medicated), but it doesn't look like this is caused by a medical condition because whenever my roommate takes her cat away for a few days when she visits her family, she is back to normal. She is usually very social and friendly, but she seems mad at everybody when the other cat is around. When he's away, she's always purring and looking for attention.

She has my room as a safe space, but it's almost impossible to keep the other cat away. Neither of them are violent, but he won't stop coming into my room to pester her. She's angry all the time when he's around. I don't really know what to do from here. I've tried incentivizing my roommate's cat to avoid my room in various different ways, but she is just generally unhappy when he's around. My lease ends in a couple months so I can move out if it's not fixed by then, but in the meantime I need a solution.

1,CatAdvice,Considering foster failing-again,"Hello all! Glad to be around fellow cat enthusiasts. 

I have a dilemma on a potential foster fail situation and I’d like to get some perspective. 


I’ve been fostering for about a year and a half and have fostered 20 cats. Very early in our foster days, my partner and I adopted a brother and sister from a litter we were fostering. We wanted to keep the girl immediately and we kept her brother because he was nervous and needed a pal. We love them unconditionally and have no regrets whatsoever. My partner and I acknowledge we were overzealous at the time and probably should’ve given them a chance to get adopted out. Fast forward, and we have significantly more fostering experience after 20 kittens. I love my fosters, but I’ve never been that attached to them and am happy when they find their homes. 

Until we got our current fosters last weekend, Truffles and Butterscotch, a bonded pair of calico sisters. My heart exploded the moment I let them out of their carrier. They’re 6 months old, my oldest fosters so far. They are so loving, polite, cuddly, get along with my cats, and well mannered girls. They wanted to sleep under the covers with us immediately and be carried around like babies. My partner and I are *so* torn on keeping them. We fully acknowledge 4 cats is a lot of work, cleaning, more vet bills and more commitment. But we adore them in a way I haven’t felt about any of my previous fosters, including my own cats. Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE my cats. But it took me a while to feel that level of connection with them. Both my partner and I feel highly emotional at the thought of them leaving our house, and neither of us have felt that before. We both have the $ to support that many animals and we live in a situation where all cats can get space if they need it.",curlyswirl93,2022-11-26,07:33:03,2022,11,26,7,33,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,New kitten stressing out my older cats,"Hi everyone, I'm new here so sorry if I miss something!
My partner and I have two beautiful cats (7yo Persian/Ragdoll male and 3yo Persian female). We recently adopted a British Shorthair kitten (3.5 months-ish male) and he is very excited and active, as kittens are..

The 7yo is fine with him but sometimes loses his patience. The 3yo, however, is very stressed by the kitten. She hasn't been nice to him once. She hisses and growls at him if she sees him nearby and bats him if he dares to get too close. I know this stuff is normal, but he's been home over a month with no improvement.

This evening I was trying to remove some of her matted fur and she got very aggressive with me. She also seems to have some balding spots on the side of her belly (possibly over grooming, or maybe from matting?) she often gets matts but it's never been this alarming. She's also losing her voice from hissing so much.

We have feliway friends plugins but they don't seem to be helping. I absolutely adore my little Persian, she's always been feisty and a little distant, but now she seems VERY stressed and aggressive with everyone, not just the kitten.

The kitten has a special room he's been confined to since he came home so they have their own 'safe spaces' but I'm worried my little Persian is going to end up in a bad way from the stress.

Any advice is greatly appreciated",exeliax,2022-11-26,03:59:48,2022,11,26,3,59,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,Friendly brothers started fighting - need help,"I have two cats. They are littermates and I've had them for two years. Until four days ago they were good friends, always playing and caring for each other. They always slept together and never seemed to mind sharing their resources (we have plenty of food and water resources around the house and 3 litterboxes). They are both neutered. 

Four days ago they suddenly got into a nasty fight. They were both sleeping in our bed and out of the blue we started hearing yeowling and hissing. The smaller one hid and there were drops of urine and bits of fur on the floor. After this I separated them, and kept them in different rooms, each with water, food and litterboxes. 

One day later I tried to unite them again. They were fine for 20 minutes, and then started fighting again. 

Now I've been keeping them separated for 3 days. They are chill with me and my partner, they just dont like being stuck in rooms, without being able to roam around the house. One of the rooms has a glass door, so I can have them both looking at eachother without touching - however, I have been doing this for short periods of time since when they see eachother they freak out and stare, with raised hairs. Both seem agressive towards one another. 

Last time I did this (today), the smaller one hid, and has been hiding inside the glass door room ever since. 

I have bought a Feliway diffuser, but so far no results. They have been seen by a vet, that said it seemed a comportamental issue and suggested medicating one of them (the initial agressor). 

Any advice ? It is being very hard to deal with this situation and I feel I'm not helping them.",Polyglot_Sphenoid,2022-11-26,02:29:48,2022,11,26,2,29,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,We need to leave our cat with someone for a month but we're not sure what option is the best one (or the lesser evil),"1st option: the house of the parents of my girlfriend. It's on the field, near a forest, so chances of escaping are high. She's climbed to trees before, but the parents of my girlfriend won't be able to climb after her. Also now there are 2 new dogs that she doesn't know. She will have the whole house for her and will be able to sleep wherever she wants.

2nd option: a room in the house of a friend. This friend has another cat and 2 dogs. Our cat has leucemia (no symptoms though), so she won't be able to mingle with the other cat, which is why she'd be in a room. We're not sure if the friend's cat has the vaccine for leucemia but we're offering to pay it, just in the event that she escapes that room (she will 100% escape at least twice). The good thing is that ""escaping"" here doesn't mean that she will be out in the forest.

3rd option: not a lot. Pet hotels are either too expensive or they keep the animals in cages, which would be worse than option 2.

I feel like option 1 would be more ""physically"" endangering while option 2 would be more ""emotional"" or stressing (but I guess being out in the wild would be stressing too). I think option 2 is ""objectively"" safer but I'm not sure. What do you think?",Dahks,2022-11-26,01:53:18,2022,11,26,1,53,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,What to do 7month kitten and 2.5yr cat,"Hello. My girlfriend and I recently (month ago) adopted two cats from the local shelter. One (7month male) and the other (2.5 yr female). Both fixed and such. 

Does anyone have any suggestions - I am feeling a bit like we made a mistake not getting either *just* the 2.5 yr old or not getting the 7mo along with another kitten from his litter. 

He is very active and curious. He wants to play anytime he isn’t sleeping. She enjoys laying low all day long and can sit in front of the window for hours on end. She isn’t really interested in play time (maybe about 10 min max (if that) a day). Obviously this isn’t the best mix. He walks around sadly meowing sometimes like he really wants a friend. I work from home so I can give him a bit of attention but I really feel like he needs a friend around his age with similar energy. 

We cannot get a third cat at our apartment (2 max). Also, we don’t know her history - the shelter didn’t have much info to share. (Don’t know if she was someone’s house pet that they gave up or what). He and his liter were found in a trash can and spent the first 6 months at the shelter. 

At first she was very scared of him. Hissing and running and hiding anytime he got near. (We had them meet at the shelter and that didn’t happen there). Over the course of the last month that has improved and it isn’t as often. However he tries to play with her and it truly seems like she just doesn’t understand what play is. We thought they were finally playing together the other day but once the wrestling stopped it was clear she did not know that it was play (she was extremely shaken and anxious for ~20 min after). 

I guess I’m not sure what to do. Perhaps she needs to be in a home where she is the only cat. She’s not very affectionate towards humans either. But I don’t know if that’s in part because the kitten is always around. I know it’s likely he will start to mellow a bit over the next year - but am I depriving him of something by not having a real friend? And is it not fair to her for having to deal with him and be so anxious? Maybe enough time hasn’t passed and they will become friends.. but I’m worried they won’t as their attitudes/energies are quite different.",rooster_doot,2022-11-26,01:24:01,2022,11,26,1,24,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,Best Kitten Food,"Hello! My bf and I are adding a kitten to our lives hopefully in the next few days/weeks! Checking out some shelters/rescues this weekend. We have two cats already- who I feed Weruva and occasionally Tiki Cat. The one cat sometimes eats fancy feast when he's being picky. Plus their dry food.

Now, we haven't had a kitten in about 11 years - so I guess I'm wondering what the best kitten food out there is(within reason financially)? Should I stick to the weruva/tiki cat brands or is there another kitten food you guys would reccommend? Thanks in advance.",sunflowerhoop919,2022-11-25,23:36:34,2022,11,25,23,36,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Is it normal for a cat to just chill under the couch?,"She goes under there and just chills/sleeps. She’s eating perfectly fine, playing, chasing bugs etc. it just makes me and my bf sad cause normally she’ll come and sit on our laps/couch during the evening while we’re watching tv or whatever. 

She’s not scared or anything but we’re just curious if this means something? It’s been very hot (28/31 degrees) here the past few days so maybe that has something to do with it? 

She’s female, about 1.5 years old and a VERY active/playful cat. Very strong prey drive. Admittedly we don’t play with her as much as she’d like (at least once per day normally, but she’d play for hours if she could) but she gets so much love and attention she’s literally our life.",4real93,2022-11-25,22:50:25,2022,11,25,22,50,Friday
1,CatAdvice,Cat Eats Dog’s Food,"Hi There! 

So… Our cat likes to snack on our dog’s food. She is up 1 lb from last year, so I don’t want the trend to continue. I talked to her vet about it, and he said it’s not great for her because the nutritional balance is different. 

Our dog is a grazer, so it’s not ideal to put his food away — but that may ultimately be the easiest and best solution. 

In the meantime, I’ve been feeding our cat less of her food to hopefully balance it out. 

I even tried getting the same flavor and brand of the dog’s food in the cat version, but she wouldn’t touch it 😅

Does anyone else have this problem? Any solutions?",eggontherun,2022-11-25,22:32:47,2022,11,25,22,32,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Where to put my cat at night?,"My cat loves to be outdoors and during the day gets to be wherever he wants because there is almost always someone to open the door for him. However this is a problem at night. At some point, he starts to complain to go out. After an hour or so he comes back. He usually repeats this 2-3 times until the morning. I’ve tried several times to spare other family members from waking up from his meows by trying to get him to sleep in my bedroom at least for a few hours, but he meows deeply and sadly pretty soon.

The solution for this in the warmer months is by leaving him in the nearby shed over the night where he has food/water and a litterbox inside. I pick him up in the morning. However the nights are much colder now, it can get around 32F (0C) outside, not much warmer in the shed. I feel like it’s not right to leave him there while it’s that cold, I feel guilty that he would be freezing and having health problems afterwards. At this point I am pretty much desperate to find a solution for the winter months. 

Ps. Pet entrance is not an option",jordgubbe89,2022-11-25,21:03:39,2022,11,25,21,3,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Cat still having litter box issues after over 6 months,"I've posted here multiple times before but nothing seems to work, so I'm trying to get more opinions again. 

We got our cat in March from the local shelter; she was declawed and immediately surrendered by her previous owner and has some other trauma, as well as previously being indoor/outdoor. Ever since we got her she has always pooped outside of the litter box. She'll pee in it but is really inconsistent about pooping. 

She has two litter boxes in different parts of the house that are always accessible to her and they're scooped daily. I switch out the litter every 4-6 weeks. She has a soft litter (okocat) for her paws and I put Cat Attract in it when I swap out the boxes.

We've swapped out her food for one that suits her, gone through three or four litters, got a hood for both of her boxes, took off a hood, bought a new box, put it in another location, we encourage her and give her extra affection every time we see her use the litter box, and we move her into the litter box if she looks like she's about to go.

We took her to the vet months ago, but the vet told us that she was perfectly healthy, just having behavioral problems, but to keep trying new things. 

It's incredibly stressful and honestly embarrassing especially that it's gone on this long, and I absolutely would never rehome her unless I literally could not take care of her anymore financially and/or physically but I'm running out of solutions. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason-- she'll have a perfectly clean fresh litter box and then just walk in our room, poop by the XBox, twitch her tail a couple of times, and leave. No texture preference either-- brick, carpet, and our regular plastic flooring are all vulnerable to her ass. She's a very large cat, especially since she's not adult age yet, and she poops at least two or three times per day and her stool is huge. 

If anyone has any advice/ideas please let me know!!",tsukun3k0,2022-11-25,13:37:40,2022,11,25,13,37,Friday

But I am now realizing the importance of providing meal times and I just need help getting started.

1,CatAdvice,Kitten still skittish after 2 months,"I’m here for advice because I want to help her! I don’t have much background on where she came from but I can say she likely was not socialized properly.

Miss Maisie is 4 months old and I can tell she wants to be loved ! She will play with her ribbon toy, she will eat food out of my hand. I’ve lured her up super close to my face to where she was standing on me with a treat. She is not afraid to be around generally. She comes in the couch if I’m sitting up there, she sleeps on the couch or in the cat tree. Sometimes in the kitchen she doesn’t even run if I walk past her. She even sleeps on my legs sometimes, or I’ll feel her walking up my back while I’m laying down “asleep”. She gets close and sniffs but quickly darts away. 

It’s like she just has really bad anxiety. I do handle her quite often and whenever I have people over they like to play with her. My boyfriend handles her as well. Sometimes I approach her on the cat tree and let her sniff me and give her a little pet. Sometimes she hisses but she’s not aggressive- she’s never bitten or scratched me. Her ears are never back either. The fact that she will eat from my hands - which I take advantage of- makes me believe she kinda trusts me at least a little? As bad as it is I give her whipped cream when I have it, in exchange I pet her while she eats it.

I brought a pheromone diffuser , I think she seems a LITTLE less skittish but it’s also only been 5 days. What else can I be doing? I can’t tell if I should handle her more or handle her less. I’ve never had a kitten this skittish before",Thedailybee,2022-11-25,11:59:13,2022,11,25,11,59,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Looking for Advice Regarding Feeders and/or Food for Cat with IBD,"Our cat, Bella, has been diagnosed with IBD, and it has been a *battle* trying to figure everything out. Our biggest problem is the food access -- we have five other cats (it's a litter we saved years ago when I was a child) that have *always* been free feeders. These five are, at this point, technically seniors and the last thing we want is to change what they're use to, but we know Bella *cannot* have the dry food they are use to. I was wondering if anyone knew of a feeder that can lock *one* particular cat out, but remain open for the rest?   


I'm also needing recommendations regarding her food itself -- they gave us Purina EN, and that was working fine... but Bella has always been extremely picky, and has decided to turn her nose up to it after having eaten it for a few days (she did this with other can foods we'd been supplementing her with before her diagnoses, it's like she wants different flavors?). Are there other brands like EN? Could we rotate them and the EN so maybe she won't get bored and refuse to eat?",___countess___,2022-11-25,08:44:45,2022,11,25,8,44,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Cat started peeing outside the litter box (medically all clear according to vet),"Our two cats are 1,5y, f and m. My girl always voiced her disapproval by peeing, but very rarely (maybe 3 times since we got them a year ago) and it was always very clear what the reason was (she peed on clothes that smelled like a different cat that lay on the floor for some time for example). 

So roughly two weeks ago, she suddenly started peeing into the corridor and the bathroom in three different spots. We went to the vet, medically she is fine. I'm trying to figure out what the problem is, but I'm struggling here, so maybe someone has some ideas. 

So what I've already figured out/ruled out: 

Changes: My schedule changed and I'm home a bit less. My SO is home the same amount of time as before, and the cats schedule didn't change (same feeding and play times). Also, I disconnected their water fountain and switched it temporarily to a simple bowl (because the cats didn't use it and I was planning on trying a different one. Extra problem, the water pump started to be super loud and annoying after a year). But could that really be why she pees outside the box? Two to three times a day? And if so, what can I do to stop it?

What I'm already doing right: the two cats have three litter boxes that get cleaned two to three times a day. They don't have a lid or lining and are placed both in social and a bit more quiet areas throughout the house (living room, bathroom and by the entrance), also no litter changes. The pee spots get cleaned with enzyme cleaners every time after the cat pees there. We play with wand toys three times a day for ~15-20 mins each, we have regular feeding times. The cats have toys they can play play themselves, cat trees, window spots, and get lots of attention and love. There is no tension between the cats, they play with each other and all seems fine. We had a feliway diffuser before when we they came to us but stopped using it shortly after, we bought a new one two days ago, but it didn't change anything yet.

1,CatAdvice,How to train kittens to sleep at night?,"I am aware cats are night creatures, however... my neighbors don't know. And also don't care. And thus it's for me to ""fix"" the problem before I get kicked out...

Short story long, I've adopted 2 kittens - they are 14 weeks old now. They are very kind, playful, and cute. They sleep the entire day but they have this thing where they get crazy active around 1-2 AM.

They look like ""posseted"" creatures. They hit everything, jump from all over the place and run like crazy. Initially I thought I can get them tired, but they can keep at it over 1 hour...  They mostly chase each other, but even if just one of them feels like this, he's doing it all by himself. And it's terrible for my neighbours.

Currently, what I do is when they get active, I close them in the smallest room - the bathroom. They miau for 5 minutes, hit the door... but eventually they go to sleep. However, I feel bad to do this.

I've tried feeding them earlier (last meal at 19-20). I tried feeding them late (last meal at 23). I tried playing with them for over 1h with all sorts of toys - around 9PM. It's great, at 10 they go to sleep, wake up an 2AM and go crazy again.

I tried keeping them awake during the day, but... I still have to work. Every time I stop giving them attention, they just go to sleep.   


Usually I try to hit the bed around 11 - where I stay 1h longer reading. Sometimes they come sleep with me, sometimes they don't...

Note: They also have a small window of crazy activity in the morning, around 8. But it ends after I feed them (usually at 8:30) - they just go to sleep after.

Is it bad to lock them out, every night, hoping they just go to sleep and in time adjust their schedule? What else can I do?",Erythr0s,2022-11-25,00:39:04,2022,11,25,0,39,Friday
1,CatAdvice,How to train an outdoor cat to come in at night?,"Family member only wants an outdoor cat, will not get one if it’s indoor. I hate the idea because it’s not as safe for the cats, but figure an imperfect home is better than being at a shelter.

They live in a rural area so predators are a potential issue but cars less so. They have a place for the cats to go at night, with bedding and food and litter. How to train the  cats to associate that area as home? Is it better for them to get kittens or an adult cat? Any advice for keeping their cats safe? They will listen to advice but I only have indoor cats and they have flat out said no indoor cats",Soft_Replacement_847,2022-11-25,00:33:53,2022,11,25,0,33,Friday
1,CatAdvice,Cat has all of a sudden started peeing on my toddlers play mat and toys,"

I have an 14 year old cat who’s all of a sudden started deficating and urinating only on my toddler sons playmat and toys which is in the living room 

This started in Monday maybe, the only thing that’s changed is we removed the playpen which surrounded it and got rid of the cabinet next to it as my son has learned to climb 

She does it in front of us and the runs off, she still uses her litter box once or twice a day 

We took her to to vets but they couldn’t get her a blood test as she got distressed so taking her back next week 

We’ve been soaking the area in simple solution cat stain remover I’m at my wits end I don’t know what to do 

I don’t have the hands spare to clean it up without my child getting in it, I can’t do this everyday. It’s becoming such a problem,

Her litter is in cellar which she can get too as she also has her food in there, this is the only place we can really put it which stops the baby getting to it

Is there anything else we can try whilst waiting for the vet appointment to see if there’s a medical issue",PurpleUnicorn434,2022-11-25,00:11:22,2022,11,25,0,11,Friday

He also keeps getting on my head and waking me up from clawing my scalp also biting my earlobe. We have another cat that he hasn’t formally met and get along with. The adult cat hisses and growls. Meanwhile my kitten just charges her then they scream at the top of their lungs. Any advice to get them to meet.

1,CatAdvice,My car loves my phone charger…but only at night?,"Currently writing this at 5 am because my girl recently seemingly out of no where as developed a love of playing with cords. but not just any cords, my phone charger. however, the weird thing is, she only really wants to play with it at night. she’ll jump onto my bed at random points while i’m dead asleep and claw and naw at the cord. i’m not sure what to do. the charger is like right next to my head when i have my phone plugged in so she basically jumps on my face which obviously wakes me up. i’ve tried plugging in the charger behind my bed so she can’t see or have access to the entire cord. no use, she will still come up and seemingly dig for the charger. i know this isn’t like the worst thing ever. but it is very inconvenient because i haven’t been able to sleep very well because she jumps onto me as i sleep, i can hear her right next to my head clawing for the cord and eventually nawing, and ofc i’m worried she’ll eat a part of the cord that could be dangerous so i can’t allow myself to fall into a deep sleep. i’m sure she’s partly doing this all for attention, which is obviously lacking since i’m sleeping, because she has never exhibited this behavior before. Any advice? how do i make sure she’s occupied while also making sure my charger doesn’t get chewed up and stop working?",chronicallychill02,2022-11-24,20:12:09,2022,11,24,20,12,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,"I bought Tofu Cat Litter, but it's mixed with Bentonite Clay","So a shop I used to buy pretty cheap and affordable Tofu Cat Litter shop closed down and I needed to search up another shop that sold the same brand.

(The brand of cat Litter I use is this Korean brand, so I can't really type out its name.)

So I went ahead, found a shop, selling the same brand and all and bought 7 bags and to my disdain, they were mixed with Bentonite Clay.

The reason why I love using Tofu Cat Litter is because its flush able and all. There's stricter trash segregation laws in where I live, and sometimes, garbage trucks don't come for literal months to get our trash. Tofu Cat Litter is appealing to me because of how easy to clean it is.

I went back to the shop, and well turns out, the shop does in fact state that they do mix the cat litter with bentonite clay. 89% is Tofu Cat Litter and 11% is Bentonite (or so the product says). I simply just didn't pay attention, since I was more focused on searching for the same brand I liked. 

It's on me and I'll take the L on that one. But I'm still uncomfortable of using the cat litter, especially in the idea of flushing down bentonite down the toilet.

I guess I'm just asking for advice on what should I do?",burntpankeki,2022-11-24,17:33:36,2022,11,24,17,33,Thursday

My cat noticed I let her play with his toys and held her and he got super jealous and now he's been avoiding me. He's fine with everybody else in my house but me. He doesn't want to play with me, he doesn't make eye contact with me anymore and doesn't want to be in my arms either. However, with the rest of my family members, he's been very friendly with them.

1,CatAdvice,Kitty sisters growling and hissing at each other in new environment,"My cats are litter mates and I adopted them together 10 years ago. They have been best of friends their entire lives. Inevitably if one comes back from the vet smelling a bit funny there is some hissing but they sleep together and play together and seem to genuinely love each other. 

In the past I’ve traveled with them to visit my parents in a different state. It’s a long drive but they don’t seem to mind it too much and on previous visits they were a bit stressed upon arrival to my parents house (they had 2 cats and 2 dogs) but after some time would venture out of my room and my parents pets would come into my room. They never liked my parents pets but they seemed to tolerate one another without too much fuss. 

This year my parents have moved to a smaller house and adopted a new and much bolder car than their other two. While my cats are isolated in their own room with me, they are constantly growling and hissing at each other and even fighting. I hate to see them this uncomfortable without even each other to lean on so to speak. It’s late now but I’m planning on buying feliway tomorrow but unfortunately won’t be able to keep them separated because the new house is too small.

1,CatAdvice,Wrong household for growing cat,"We have a 5 month old family cat that my brother brought home a month ago (funded by our parents and me), and so he refers to her as “his cat.” He accepted full responsibility beforehand since he really wanted a cat.

I have a problem with how he takes care of his cat. She gets food and water on somewhat of a schedule, and receives lots of cuddles (when she is open to receiving them). However, my brother never plays with “his cat” and she has destroyed a few household objects because of the lack of activity.

She also jumps and scratches and so if she isn’t distracted by play then she is with him in his room while he is on his laptop or phone. 

She meows and paws at the door a lot but he claims it’s just for “attention” and she doesn’t need nearly as much physical activity as I “think she does” even though I’ve done research and spoke with two animal behaviorists on this subject and he’s admitted to doing “no research,” but he still knows “better than” me.

The rest of the household plays with the cat when we can, but one member has an IDD and is scared of the cat because my brother doesn’t “believe in training” and won’t do anything for when she jumps on people except 1) tell the person she is jumping on that it’s not a big deal and 2) take her back to his room and do nothing to help her get her energy out.

I feel so fucking bad for this cat and Idk what to do. Whenever I tell him this has to change he doesn’t see a problem with it. What’s the point of a family pet if the family can’t even enjoy the pet and vice versa?",myneedtobreathe,2022-11-24,12:32:19,2022,11,24,12,32,Thursday

TLDR: can a bouquet with lilies in it be on the table at dinner and then put away, with a cat in the house? Google is giving me mixed results. 

I have a cat and was gifted a thanksgiving bouquet centerpiece for dinner tomorrow as it’s hosted at my house. I looked at the bouquet and it’s full of lilies- tiger and natal. I know how poisonous they are to cats and have actively avoided them. The bouquet is now locked away in a room. He hasn’t touched it or gone near it. 

Is it safe to put the bouquet on the table tomorrow for dinner and then return it to the locked room? I have been reading mixed statements on google about exposure type/time and the correlation between poisoning. I will obviously get rid of the bouquet all together if it is deemed unsafe to have out on the table for a few hours- but want to try to be courteous as the people that gifted it to me will be at dinner.",thunderfig,2022-11-24,11:27:54,2022,11,24,11,27,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,Cat bullying?,"I recently adopted an 8 week old kitten (Susan) &amp; brought her home to my apartment. I currently live with my partner &amp; his 2 year old cat (Fork). I did my best to take things slow but my partner is a little less… cautious than I am, so they met fairly quickly and after a bit of hissing from Fork he quietened down. 

Now, my concern is this. Fork is a big cat and he’s not well socialised (in my opinion). He isn’t affectionate, rarely comes near us, is very shy in new situations, but is quite energetic. I do my best to play with him and provide him mental stimulation but he never tires. When he tries to “play” with the kitten he is quite rough and he also never leaves her alone. He follows her (and I) from room to room and completely fixated on her. When he approaches and tries to play/bop her, she doesn’t want to engage but he keeps going, chasing her around and getting rougher and rougher. 

Previously, my partner and Fork lived in a shared flat with an older cat who didn’t want anything to do with him but he would just follow her around and paw at her, never backing off even when she hissed at him. He wasn’t aggressive per se but it was almost like “how much can I annoy this other cat”.

I’m doing my best to reward Fork when he is gentle and “punish” him when he’s rough but separating them and closing the door, but I’m concerned he’s bullying her. 

So is this something to be concerned about?",ladymargarine5813,2022-11-24,08:13:03,2022,11,24,8,13,Thursday

Im a first time cat owner to a loveley 2yr old tabby we will call Cat. I absolutely adore Cat she looks so cute and always wants to be pet or sleep, but she is also very very anxious.

1,CatAdvice,Cat jealousy issue,"Do cats really love you? I've had 3 kittens for a little over a year. 2 of my cats act super loving toward me- they always cuddle, want to be pet, follow me around all the time, so much purring, kneading me, sleep on me every night, cry every time I close the door to the bathroom, etc! I love them so much and think the world of them! The other one is so sweet, just not as cuddly or attached to me. Right now I am on vacation for 9 days overseas and had to bring my cats to a sitter. The cat sitter had been great and she's been sending lots of videos and pictures of my kittens doing the same loving behavior toward her. Although I'm very happy they are not feeling sad or lonely, I feel extremely jealous, like the same feeling I got in high school when a boy I liked paid attention to someone else. I thought it was me they loved, but is it just a thing cats like that would do to anyone???? I know it's a silly and selfish feeling, but I still feel it.

1,CatAdvice,Introducing Cats When One is Deaf,"My husband and I each moved into our new home a year ago with our cats: Toby (14+ yo, and completely deaf) and Moxie (5ish yo). We have tried to introduce them multiple times with the Jackson Galaxy method. It just doesn't seem to work because when Moxie hisses or growls, Toby straight up cannot tell and continues getting up in her face. He definitely wants to be friends and she is just ticked off since he seemingly ignores her warning vocalizations. Lots of chasing and swatting ensues because she tries to run away and he corners her.

Thus far after trying we have just gone back to having a schedule for who has access to the rest of the house outside of their rooms; they alternate days. Sigh. We will keep them separate forever if we have to but really would love to be able to have both cats in laps in the same room simultaneously!

We have the next few days off of work and are pondering if we should just open both doors and let them figure it out amongst themselves while we are here to separate them if we need to. How do we know if their interactions are what's to be expected vs being harmful to them?  Is the fact that we are stressed out by the prospect of one of them getting hurt going to affect how the introduction goes?

1,CatAdvice,Need help bonding with new shelter kitty,"I recently adopted a shelter cat (from a feral cat colony - he was injured and had his leg amputated, upon which he was sent to a shelter). He is about 4 years old, and a neutered male. 

When we met shelter cat and first brought him home, he was skittish but open to petting and really seemed to enjoy it. 

We currently have a 13 yr old domesticated neutered male who has been the only cat in his household. 

After introducing the two of them (slow intros, scent swapping, separate rooms, visual through gate), shelter cat started hissing at humans and now does not allow any human contact, swatting and biting us if we try. He has not really been improving, despite being extremely food motivated. He will eat near us, but runs away immediately after finishing his food/treats. 

The two cats have been hissing/meowing at each other and are very wary of each other, despite eating on opposite sides of the gate. We have installed pheromone diffusers and consulted many online resources to no avail. 

Is it just a matter of time? (Its been almost a full month) Or something else? Mostly I am concerned about shelter kitty’s personality shift towards humans. How can we get him to trust us more? Why such a drastic shift towards petting?",afroggy,2022-11-24,07:03:09,2022,11,24,7,3,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,"neglected, abused cat","To keep things short, around 2 weeks ago i came across a male cat who had puss in his eyes and wounds in his ear. It was freezing outside and he was soaking wet. I was actually going to the neighbours house (let’s call her Alison) and Alison told me that the owners leave this cat outside all the time. They don’t care for it and only use it for breeding to make money. She also told me that they have a female cat that they keep indoors but they’ve bred this cat around 7/8 times and the cat is 5 years old. My heart broke for them both and the male cat was so friendly, he kept trying to get inside my car and sit on my bonnet just for the engine warmth. Alison has rang the RSPCA and the local council multiple times but they haven’t done anything. I also rang RSPCA on the same day i saw him and i sent pictures of him to them and they still haven’t done anything yet. However, my problem is that it’s getting colder here in the UK and it’s only a matter of time before this poor cat dies from negelect. I personally don’t think anything’s going to be done about this so i’m seriously contemplating pulling up one day and just taking him. He needs serious vet attention and somewhere warm to recover. Alison told me that the cat isn’t microchipped or even flead and wormed, and the owners are very hostile so approaching them and asking them for the cat if they don’t want it is out of the question. 

Basically, I was wondering if I should actually take him? And what can i do to avoid getting caught? Because morally i just can’t leave that cat there to die.

1,CatAdvice,Upset tummy,"Hi guys I was wondering if you could help.

If I ring the vet they'll most likely say bring my boy in but if I do that he gets very stressed and had cystitis in the past so I'm worried the stress will cause a flare up.

He is a 4 year old male on prescribed food for the previous issue of cystitis. He's a greedy boy too always face first in the bowl. He is a indoor cat so has not got hold of anything he shouldn't have.

He has had a upset tummy 3 days. First day he went and it was like soft serve and slightly yellow but not alarming. He then went twice more that evening and was pure liquid. 

Second day exactly the same as his first but this day he didn't eat all day. Also wasn't himself.

Ge started eating again yesterday smaller amounts but something. Yesterday it was just like soft serve and normal colour. 

Today he is eating a little still. Is much more himself, alert, playful, wants fuss. Even had 100 percent chicken breast treats. But he's been 3 times today. 2 times like soft serve but a little more put together. Then this evening so almost the 4th day now it was slightly yellow again, some formation but more liquid then earlier today. 

I'm not sure wether he's actually on the mend or I should take him up tomorrow. In himself he's doing better but the slightly worse last poo worries me.

Everytime he goes to the vet and for the whole journey he meows, shakes and pants. Then comes home and shakes for hours. 

Also money is a issue. I do have a little and I do have insurance but it's the kind you pay upfront and claim back. I can attach photos of poop but I'm not sure you'd want to see. 

Haven't seen him drink too much but he's had some and has been licking the gravy of his food.",Particular-Ad3636,2022-11-24,01:50:22,2022,11,24,1,50,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,Feral kittens in socialization process: When to let them out of their enclosure to explore/roam the room they’re in.,"TLDR: I took in a litter of 3 feral kittens, they’re 2 months old, 2 females, 1 male. I’ve been taking care of them with the hope of socializing them and giving them out for adoption. Their socialization process has been slow. I want to know when the right time to let them out into my bedroom is, their enclosure is in my bedroom. 

▪️(Female) Kitten 1 
Arrived October 25-
I started to let her out into the room 2 weeks ago but now I only let her out to sleep on the bed. When let out in my room, very playful and active on her own but gets scared easily and runs and hides when I walk into the room, when there’s sounds or sometimes if I move. Sometimes she’ll let me pet her but most of the time she won’t stay and will run off. Seems antsy to be loose in the room. Used to be cuddlier when she arrived. The one with the most progress, lets me pick her up most of the time when in the enclosure, sleeps on my bed but not very cuddly.  

▪️(Male) Kitten 2 
Arrived November 7- 
Has bitten me hard 3 times, they day he arrived and the day after a vet visit. This kitten has had the slowest progress of all three. He’ll stay on my lap to eat but will want off as soon as he’s done eating. I pet him when he eats. Usually doesn’t let me pet him when I reach in the enclosure. Does eat from my hand. Strong, if he runs I have to let him go, he’ll bite, wiggle and scratch otherwise. 

▪️(Female?) Kitten 3
Arrived November 15-I can pet her sometimes while she’s in the enclosure. Sometimes she watches me intently and up until recently, her eyes dilated most of the time I was near, not as much now, I look away. She’ll stay on my lap a little while after feeding and I’ll pet her. Will eat from my hand. 

➖They all seem to want to be out in the room and get really curious when kitten 1 is out but since I don’t know when the right time to introduce them to my bedroom is, I stopped letting Kitten 1 out. I’d really appreciate your advice on this or if you have any feral kitten advice in general, I’ll gladly welcome it, it’s been hard.",deepspacedivers,2022-11-24,01:18:22,2022,11,24,1,18,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,Why does my cat bring me the same toy every night?,"So, my husband and I adopted 2 kittens a little over a year ago. A boy and a girl, they’re a little over a year old now. We also moved about 5 months ago and ever since getting into our new apartment, our male cat, Pippin, has been doing this thing where he’ll bring us one of his toys, a stick with a bell and rope attached and feathers on the end. Every time he does this he starts meowing and will find us wherever we are in the apartment and usually won’t stop until we make some acknowledgment of it. He never did this before we moved and our female cat doesn’t do this either. I’ve had cats most of my life and never experienced it, but this is the first time I’ve had fully indoor cats, so maybe that has something to do with it. It’s been increasing in frequency to the point that he does this almost every night. A few minutes after we get in bed, we’ll hear him start meowing and dragging the toy down the hall. About half the time he’ll jump on the bed to bring us the toy and once we say hi to him, he just lays down like normal. This happens occasionally (about every few days) during the day as well. It’s not a problem but I have also noticed that when he does this, he’ll sometimes make a motion kind of like he’s trying to cough up a hairball but doesn’t make any sound and doesn’t drop the toy when he does this. I’m just really curious and wondering if it’s something to do with him being a male cat or if I should be concerned?

1,CatAdvice,How can I get my 5 year old female cat to stop biting my houseguests' hands?,"She's a very sweet cat but she gets overstimulated very easily. She'll approach strangers acting lovey and wanting pets but then she flips the switch almost immediately to Play Mode and will try to bite/scratch at their hands. 

I know she isn't doing it maliciously and she does it to me at times which I personally don't mind too much even though it can be sort of annoying at times. But it startles some of my guests and she sometimes gets a bit carried away and bites a bit too hard and it actually hurts. 

Any tips on things I can do when I'm alone with her to try to get her out of this habit? I've been working on making it obvious that she hurt my hand if she bites too hard and will stop petting her and turn away from her and try to pet her again once she's calmed down, trying to reward her with affection when she let's me pet her without biting. 

This seems to be helping a little bit maybe, but it's hard to tell since I don't have guests over very often. 

I just want everybody to see what a lovey sweet cat she is, and I want her to get all the pets in the world. She's always so confused about why they stop petting her :(",kukenn_,2022-11-23,22:35:49,2022,11,23,22,35,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,Co-Ownership of Cat Microchip Registration,Hi! My vet recommended that we should register our cat’s microchip just in case something happened to him. I was going to register my cat’s microchip under my name but my husband also wanted to be put onto the contact list as well. I was looking through some companies to register our cat’s microchip onto but there weren’t any options to have two contacts or co-ownership of the cat. I was wondering if this is just how microchipping works or if there are any companies that allow two contacts to be registered. Thanks!,honkshooo,2022-11-23,17:38:53,2022,11,23,17,38,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,Cat pooing inside since house move,"Hi guys 

So my cat Blue is a very well behaved boy and I trained him to go to the toilet outside when he was little with no problems.

I moved house in August and kept him in for 6 weeks with his litter tray. When he started going outside, I got a cat flap fitted and naturally he started finding an outside loo and I took the litter tray away. 

There are some new big bully cats he’s had a few stand offs with and now he’s a bit afraid of going outside, even nipping out to the toilet. He’ll go if I’m out there with him, but I can’t always keep an eye on when he might need to go, and I’m not always in.

I started trying to associate the outside with “good things” so would give him his breakfast outside and sit with him, and have also been hiding treats around the patio which generally keeps him entertained. 

However in the last couple of weeks,  his go-to before he even thinks to go outside is finding corners in the house to go to the toilet. It’s very frustrating for obvious reasons, and this morning I have had to reinstate the litter tray because it’s become such a regular occurrence and I don’t trust him in the house anymore. It doesn’t help that it’s very rainy where I live which is an extra reason he doesn’t always want to go outside. 

I don’t want to have a litter tray forever, and feel like we’re regressing! Has anyone experienced this and have any tips/advice for retraining your cat to go outside / rebuilding lost confidence?

Thanks in advance from a desperate cat lover !",beeficakes25,2022-11-23,16:21:35,2022,11,23,16,21,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,how do i get my cat to stop burying all the food and water in litter?,"i have two cats, a 1yr old named nubs and a 2.5 yr old named crusty. crusty has always “buried” her food with socks that she would bring over and put over her wet food. nubs started burying the food and water in litter the second both of them were done with it, she doesn’t even eat the wet food. she will see crusty finish her first pick at the wet food (she waits to see if nubs will eat any before going back to finish it) and nubs will kick litter out of the box, and kick it all the way towards the food then kick it into the food, or she will start pushing it to the litter box to bury it. is there any way i can stop this behavior as it is getting expensive between her wasting tons of perfectly good litter and perfectly good food. the food and litter i have right now were gifted to me by some lovely redditers so i don’t want it to go to waste. moving the food or litter is not an option i have no where else to put it.",crustiferson,2022-11-23,14:55:26,2022,11,23,14,55,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,Neighbour abandoned cats,"Looking for advice on this situation as I’ve contacted the RSPCA multiple times and they are unwilling to help and never update me. My neighbour has 2 cats (brother and sister) which they have abandoned, I waited 4 months then finally called the RSPCA when she left for 4 days over a weekend and they were left in the freezing cold starving. The last 5 months I’ve had no choice but to feed them or they would starve. I’ve even tried to not feed them for 2 days but they would cry from morning to night meowing at every door and window. Eventually I got to the point where I felt so bad I would cave in and feed them. I knew they weren’t my cats so never wanted to make them feel confused however she completely doesn’t care I have watched her when a delivery man knocks at the door, the cats have ran in and she immediately throws them back outside. It’s not the case she has no money as she constantly gets food deliveries and various parcels. These were house cats but since she got new furniture etc they were kicked outside in the summer. There is a girl that is very needy and she is now at my house day and night doesn’t even leave the garden. The boy however is very feral and looks very depressed, he is very withdrawn he doesn’t like being touched for too long and hides in corners. Within the last days I have seen the RSPCA visiting her yet so I know 100% they are her animals yet nothing has changed. I’ve never been in this situation before and certainly didn’t want to ‘steal’ anyones cats but I could not let poor harmless cats suffer. Now I’ve been looking after the cats the past nearly 6 months they’ve grown on me as a person who has mainly been a dog person previously.

1,CatAdvice,Should I surrender my cat or not?,"So I have three cats and I just moved out of my parents house for the first time into a spacious two bedroom apartment by myself. My oldest cat I've had for five years, then there's the ""outside cat"" I took with me who is three years old. Then I have a young one who is only a year and a half. My young one is the kitten of the ""outside cat"" and has been indoors since she was old enough to be separated as I somehow convinced my parents to let her in.

So, the problem is I moved to a new place four days ago and my youngest cat went into shock mode. She stopped eating and was hiding which is very unlike her. She's an energetically playful cat and very, very food motivated so it's depressing to see her like this. She's slowly coming around but her playful energy hasn't been restored and I'm fearful she might be lonely during the day while I'm at work. My apartment is also in a big complex so there are little noises here and there too that she seems to be sensitive to; my parents live in a rural country home with no background noise.

She loves the other two cats, but I think she misses my parents more than anything. My dad gave her a lot of attention and he's retired, so he was home with her all day. Both my parents are not cat people but they love her and practically begged me to let them keep her. Now that she's with me, I'm having doubts on whether or not it's right for me to have her. She doesn't seem like herself and I know she'd probably be happier in her old home with somebody who will be with her all day. But then again, I've had her since she was born and I also love her a lot and would miss her.

Would it be better to bring her back to my parents or keep her? I've been an emotional wreck and so conflicted over this because I don't want to give her up but I want what's best for her. I really want more opinions to help me come to a concrete decision; I know cats are sensitive to change so if I choose to bring her back, I would want to do it soon so that I don't further traumatize her.

Also, for reference, I live two hours away from my parents and would not be able to see her often. Hence, why this is such a big decision for me.",futuristicboyfriend,2022-11-23,08:58:53,2022,11,23,8,58,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,Kitten hisses and bites when I try to pick him up,"So I have a kitten that is about 4 months old. He doesn't like getting picked up unless he is standing, if he is laying down and you try to pick him up he will start slapping you, biting and will even hiss multiple times.

Like last time he laid down on my chair and I had a very important class coming up, when I tried to pick him up he hissed like three times and bit me. 

Again, this only happens when you try to pick him up while he is laying down. Now you can say ""don't pick him up then, but if he doesn't like it"" well what if he is in danger?

I have come to terms with the smell of catnip. but valerian. valerian is a whole other story. I can't stand it. even packed in a (perforated) zipper bag and stowed away in a dresser, I can still detect it. 

How do you deal with those smelly toys? 

Is tupperware the compromise solution - and safe at the same time? 
I am afraid that if it is stored air-tight, mold or fungus could grow (unnoticed) and thus harm my cats.

1,CatAdvice,Neighbors cat..advice please!,"My neighbor  has a super cool cat. I've lived here for 6 years, and in that time I've seen him outside maybe 5 times. However , hes going through a dovorce and ive noticed lots of changes at his house. His dogs gone, the yard is a mess, and hes barely home anymore.  For the past two weeks his owner has been gone a lot, and he always let's him out when he leaves. In fact let's just say the cat is out more than its in.  everyday for 2 weeks he has come to my house, sometimes 3 or 4 times(as estly as 4am and sometimes past midnight, so all hours of the day). He tries to come inside and meows by my back door. Hes always hungry, and ive noticed more and more fight wounds on his face in that time as well.  It's also really cold here, maybe high 30s in the day and down to 19 or less at night. Way too cold for him to be outside for hours at a time. 
I feel so bad for the cat, he just comes and meows and scratches at my door. He even has followed me on a walk yesterday and came home with me. 
I almost get this vibe my neighbor is hoping he will just ""disappear"", because he never let hin roam around like this before. Hes also a very unique breed and very friendly, I'm surprised he hasn't been taken yet.
So what can I do? I thought maybe writing a note , but honesty I don't know how to approach it.i totally have considered just keeping the cat. I love the cat, and he's welcome here. I'm mad about the situation because poor kitty is being tossed out into he freezing cold, only to come here and beg to be let in.

1,CatAdvice,Switching foods with multiple cats!,"Hello everyone!

My partner, and I recently took in a 6yr old cat(D) from a rehoming situation. We already had our current 7yr old cat(R). R suffers from feline herpes, and has always been on a grain free diet to help with those symptoms(whether it does or not is another question in itself, feel free to voice your thoughts.) D suffers from urinary issues, and came to us with urinary care dry food that he never seemed to avoid, and ate R's dry food. We have since switched him to R's dry food, and put him on Authority Urinary Care wet food for this reason. R's wet food is Purina Beyond grain free, and the current dry is Purina One True Instinct grain free.

We are looking to switch their foods to something to possibly help with weight loss for R, as he is overweight. We don't have any concerns with D's issues, and wouldn't consider him overweight by any means but he definitely could make his way to being a chonker very easily. An option we have found is Authority Hairball Control + Weight Management dry food. They also make a wet Healthy Weight food.

My question I guess is... are we better to switch R's wet food to the Healthy Weight stuff, and leave them both on current dry food... Switch R over to the Authority wet/dry weight food, but also give D the new dry food!? OR just switch the dry food for both, and leave R on his current wet food.

Is there better options for weight wet/dry out there? That was the best budget friendly option we could find. Hills was an option but is on the higher end of budget range.

1,CatAdvice,Recently just rescued an 8 week old kitten. Older cat is NOT HAPPY. help :(,"Hi all. So around two years ago I got my first place and always wanted a cat so I went to the humane society and looked at cats. I fell in love with this black cat and she was the longest resident. She was around a year old and so sweet and crazy. She’s so active and loves climbing and playing and talking lol. Anyway, she’s around 3 years old now and still is so active so I thought we could get another cat. We tried to get a male cat around a year ago and it went after her a few times and stressed her out so we got rid of it. She always grew up with cats and came into the shelter with two other cats. My friend stayed and brought her cats over and my cat was fine. So we thought a female kitten would be perfect. 

I found one and brought it home last night from a friend who found her in a storm drain. She’s been to the vet but still needs fixed. My cat is FREAKING OUT. this kitten is skkkk tiny and probably only around 8/9 weeks old and SO SWEET. my cats hair immediately went up and she started hissing and growing. Never seen her act like that. Have the kitten in the bathroom with litter food bed and toys and my cat is walking slow and low and hiding and freaked out. Will this get better? Did I make a mistake?

1,CatAdvice,Posting here about food opinions - Hill's Prescription Diet vs. Purina Pro-Plan,"**I posted a similar post on** r/AskVet **but haven't received any response. :( I hope this isn't against the rules, as a disclaimer I am open to anecdotal experience &amp; opinions because I haven't been able to get a straight answer from a vet either in-person or online!**

**Tl;dr** is -- has anyone tried switching from **Hill's Prescription diet i/d Digestive Care to Purina Pro-Plan EN Gastoenteric? Canned wet food only.** Purina is $67 for 24 cans online whereas my vet office charges $109 for 24 cans of Hill's Prescription. 

I have called multiple vet offices, and there doesn't seem to be a straight answer anywhere. It's a lot of ''I don't know'', including from my vet who said ''maybe there is a cheaper alternative''. Another vet office thought this would work, but in general there just seems to be a lot of uncertainty. 

Reason cat was put on it - basically, he's an old boi who was having some digestion problems and allergies. He is being given an allergy shot now. The vet wants him to be on ''low residue'' food.

1,CatAdvice,Our oldest resident cat is like Jekyll and Hide with our new kitten,"Hello all, I currently am the mom to 3 wonderful cats! I will be referring to them by number they were adopted so number 1 is the oldest and 3 is the youngest! 

Number 1 came home as a 3.5 month old kitten almost two years ago. When we brought home number 2 a few months later, it was like soulmates meeting for the first time! They loved each other immediately and have been inseparable ever since so I thought a new kitten wouldn’t be much of an issue.

Fast forward to now and I’ve completely fallen in love with a new kitten and have brought him home. We did the slow introduction, scent swapping, feeding together, and playing together (only positive experiences). There were green flags the whole way through. Not a single hiss or swat. Number 1 was playing with the new baby and zooming around like a kitten again. Now I thought they must be ready to sleep all together last night but number one went completely Mr. Hyde, hissing and swatting like he’d never seen this cat before! (Mind you they were snuggling on the couch just an hour before). He even swatted at number 2, something he normally would never do.

I have a strong inkling he’s possessive of our bed, or maybe he’s possessive of snuggling with me? He’s normally the cuddler and number 2 lays by my feet so there’s never been a rift before. Last night he was being insufferable so I put him in our guest room to sleep. And now this morning, him and number 3 are all good once again! 

I guess my big question is what can I do to benefit all parties? I don’t want to sleep without the baby because I don’t want him being alone, and I don’t want to encourage inappropriate urination for number 1 because I’m alienating him.

I feed them around 100g wet food at 6pm already and I'm willing to switch to wet food in full because dry foods usually don't have enough proteins etc. 

Ideally I want to feed them twice a day, can I just take their dry food away and start feeding them wet food in the morning too or would that not work?

1,CatAdvice,Cat has become obsessed with socks,"Hi,

We have two cats. One of them is quite an anxious cat and who we believe to have pica as he has an obsession with trying to eat plastic (spoke to vet about this). In the past few days he has become obsessed with carrying around socks (sometimes bras or underwear!) and will growl at anyone who comes near him. He’s swiped at me once when I’ve gone near him. We are concerned he’s going to become an aggressive cat (he’s really lovely most of the time) and was wondering if there is a way to nip this behaviour in the bud. Tried reducing his access to where he can get the socks but he seems to be able to find them when his mind is set on it 😅",Miserable-Pension-66,2022-11-22,23:47:23,2022,11,22,23,47,Tuesday

1,CatAdvice,Cats not getting along and cat chocolate?,"I'm looking for advice on helping our two cats get along. we have a tabby (7 yo) weve had since a kitten, and a Maine Coon (4 yo) we adopted in August.

We followed the slow introduction advice as best we could. However we have hit an impasse with aggressive chasing. The tabby has always been a bit aggressive with chasing and stalking behaviours.

They've never actually fought outright, but light swatting and growling is common at the end of a chase...

The thing is they can go a day or more getting along and then just start. We have a camera up to record and cannot find a trigger, although the stairs in the house seem to be the area where conflict usually starts.

We are not sure if these are play attempts, something we need to let happen on occasion so they can sort hierarchy, or what to do. FWIW we did just leave it for a weekend and while it did keep happening it didn't escalate.

Note: they are separated at all times if we cannot be there to watch them.

As a side note to this we are really struggling with rewards for the Maine Coon. She has no interest in any sort of cat treats but will absolutely try her luck at stealing chocolate and sweets if they are not watched, so any advice for appropriate sweet treats would be great.

Any advice or help would be great.",Atomicide,2022-11-22,21:16:17,2022,11,22,21,16,Tuesday
1,CatAdvice,Cat meowing loud from 5am to 7am,"My partner and I moved to a new apartment 1month ago.
My cat was a bit confused during the first weeks, but he adapted fairly quick to his new home. 
We decided to get a lot of wardrobes in our hallway. During the first weeks we didn’t have still the doors mounted on them and guess what… our cat found in them the perfect spots to hide and sleep.
Few weeks ago we mounted the doors on the wardrobes and from then the cat every morning at 5am or so, starts to meowing in front of these doors, and beat his paws very loud against that, he is also very stubborn and goes on for hours till we “wake up” at 7.30am. We can’t sleep and I’m also worried that his loud meowing disturbs the neighbours.
My assumptions is that my cat thinks the wardorbe interior is his territory and he needs to have access to it. I really don’t want him to have access or start a new habit and getting up to open the doors at his demand.
Of course he has all the comforts, scratch tree, interactive toys, full access to all the house (except wardrobes’ interior).
He rarely meowd during his whole life (he’s 5yo)

1,CatAdvice,"idk what’s going on with my cat, it’s leading me to think she’s sick or near death","On mobile, sorry for format 

She’s about 3-4 years old. A simple black cat. I had her since i was 19. We had a struggle of life (don’t we all) but we’re making it work as best as we can. her behaviors have been changing recently. i made a post a while ago asking about her eating habits and why they changed. 


She just seems so depressed. My gf suggest my cat is reflecting my mood and energy. Cats are pretty reflective on that. But I don’t know, I don’t believe she is. 


I don’t have any money or transportation to get her to a vet or even have a consistent doctor for her, that makes me feel like shit. I was recently unemployed, but I have an interview set up. I want to give her a good life. I understand my apartment unit is shit and i don’t have an open window or balcony for her. It makes me feel so terrible. I let her roam my apartment hallways when she begs. I let her drink water from the sink. I change and specifically get her turkey pate and wet food. I change my tone when talking to her. I started playing with her more. I don’t even know if she’s gaining or losing weight.  I’m doing the best I can with my deliberating mental/emotional health. 


My perception of all of it really dark and bad. Maybe she’s not dying. Maybe she’s perfectly fine. But to me, I feel as though I’m failing her in every way as a cat father and her best friend. I really don’t know what to do. The other cat I have is doing fine. He eats, plays, and reflective positive energy. He just existing really. 


But Kota? I have no idea what to do, where I went wrong, maybe it my fault for always being broke. I need to do better. I feel like such a failure. I lm fearful of waking up this week and finding her dead. I’m at loss. And I know cats hide themselves when they’re sick or near death, and to me , it seems like she’s hiding or been sleeping in really hidden spots or just on top of this soft blanket I have. 

I wish I can  give kota and I the life we deserve, but I feel as though I’m going to lose her before I have the chance. All i can say to her is that I’m sorry for failing her. I wish i had money.. I wish i had a car…",MartelUnderground,2022-11-22,19:46:20,2022,11,22,19,46,Tuesday

To give a little background, I'm staying with my grandmother, who took in a stray that's most likely a Persian (she lives on a farm, so she often finds strays dumped on or near her property). The cat is a spayed female, at least 2 years old (since that's about how long she's had her). Because of the characteristic pushed-in face and not having much of a neck, the cat can't groom her chest fur very well and ends up with mats there. My grandmother tries to comb them out regularly, but the cat gets squirmy very quickly.

1,CatAdvice,Traveling with a new cat,"Hi all! I’m planning on adopting my first cat soon, a 1 year old female. I live alone in a 1 bedroom apartment. I have plans to visit my father over the holidays for about 4 days, and am hoping to take my new cat along with me (all my friends who could cat sit will also be out of town).

She will only have about 3-4 weeks to get comfortable with me and her new home before I take her on this trip. It’s about a 2 and a half hour drive. There will also be other cats at my dad’s house (my sister is bringing her two cats), but the house is big enough that we can easily keep them separated if they don’t get along.

Is this a bad idea? Is 3 weeks after adoption too soon to give her the stress of traveling to a different location? Wondering if I should just wait until after the holidays to adopt, or if I need to search harder for a cat sitter that’s available.",isaacw97,2022-11-22,05:06:03,2022,11,22,5,6,Tuesday

1,CatAdvice,my cats really lonely when I'm at work but doesn't like other cats,"Sorta as the title says, my cats lonely well I'm at work according to my roommate she walks around the house meowing till I get home. She's groomed the back of her front legs naked, I thought someone shaved the backs of them at first only to learn its from overgrooming.  I would've never guessed she was so lonely well I was gone because she's not any clingier when I'm at home, she's always super excited when I get home almost like a dog but she just kinda comes and goes for attention well I'm home.

I've been told I should get her a friend, but she's not meshed well with other cats. Her old owner rehomed her because she was bullying the new kitten they got and well my grandma was staying with us she and my grandma's cat didn't get along. She wasn't slowly introduced to either of the new cats so I'm wondering if we go slow it'd be different? 

My local shelter will let you ""trail run"" adoptions to see if they get along before finalizing so I'm debating on trying that.

Any tips or ideas appreciated. 


Also;
I've tried giving her cat TV and music to chill her when I'm not home, but seems to have no affect. My roommate doesn't hang out with her and likely won't be interested on doing so. She's a tortie and apparently they're known for their attitude problems? 🤔",Stabbingi,2022-11-22,04:54:54,2022,11,22,4,54,Tuesday

1,CatAdvice,Is gabapentin considered a sedative? Can someone point me to a good resource with solid info? (Cats cannot be flown sedated per AVMA and I can't find good information),"Hi everyone - I do plan on asking the vet this, but since she is the one who prescribed it knowing the intention of use I wanted to see if anyone had additional information. I'm not sure if this is asking for medical advice (sorry if it is), but more-so ""where can I find more information on this to make me feel more confident that I am doing what I am supposed to be doing while not risking my cat's health?""

We are moving across the country and we have a 5.5hr flight coming up. We decided to fly the cats (as carry on, not cargo) over instead of having a 5 day drive dealing with hotels, etc. The vet prescribed them gabapentin to calm them down during travel, but American Airline's policies say the following:

""At the recommendation of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), American Airlines will not accept household dogs and cats that have been sedated or tranquilized. Pets that have been given sedatives or tranquilizers are at a higher risk of respiratory and cardiovascular problems at high altitudes.""

I know it is not a tranquilizer, but is gabapentin a sedative? I absolutely do not want to put my cats at risk. Can anyone help me find a resource that has additional information to clarify if gabapentin is a sedative and/or if it poses these risks?

1,CatAdvice,Can my cat coexist with my parent's cat over the holidays?,"My 6mo old cat (Felix) and I are here at parent's house the week, and I'm wondering what kind of dynamic we should have with their 3yo resident cat (Max). 

We made the mistake of letting them meet right away. While there was no aggression (towards eachother), they were visibly uneasy. 

Both cats are quite docile, although Max is definitely more sensitive and can get stressed by unfamiliar people or change. Felix is very adaptable and easy-going; he's enjoyed socializing with my parents and exploring the house. He was very submissive and hesitant around Max when they met, and just kept his distance.

But to my surprise, Max was aggressive towards ME. Despite how they were only in the same room together for about 10 minutes (with no conflict), when I later tried to talk to/pet him, he growled, hissed, and even swatted at me. He hissed at my parents too when they tried, but he was significantly more aggressive towards me. 

It breaks my heart because he used to LOVE me, and I'm worried  that he might resent me now? We're keeping them separated; with Felix upstairs and Max downstairs (where he spends most of his time anyway.)

I don't let him sleep with me (I tried for a bit, but I was constantly getting woken up), so I keep him out of the bedroom at night. He's quiet during the night, and then around 6am, he starts wailing to be let in. He has a timed feeder that goes off at 7am, so he's not wanting for food; in fact, after the feeder goes off and he eats, he goes right back to screaming outside my bedroom door.

I ignore him and I don't open the bedroom door until I'm actually ready to get up (around 7:30ish), at which point I'll let him in and give him snuggles and pets. But the hour and a half-ish of him just wailing is driving me insane. He's figured out how to put his face right up to the door and scream at me so he'll be even louder. 😭 Is there anything I can do to keep him from screaming in the morning?

1,CatAdvice,Kitten aggressive with foster cat,"Hello!

I have two cats, and recently started fostering a third cat. Our kitten, around 8mo, was rescued from a feral mother. She is very food motivated, which has historically made it super easy to train her to get used to things, but I am having trouble with how she interacts with the foster cat.

Half the time, she will completely ignore him - running past him to get into a room, or sharing a space with general disinterest. She is very treat motivated, and will nearly crawl \_under\_ the foster cat to get treats. She isn't defensive about it or anything, they just happily eat treats next to each other. She doesn't seem very smart.

However, our kitten will also chase him around the house, cornering him under tables, watching him like a hawk. She will hiss and sputter and take swings at him occasionally - it does not seem like play behavior and the foster cat definitely isn't reading it as such.

I'm not sure how to disincentivize her from picking fights. The foster cat is much bigger than her, I'm not worried about his safety that much, but he is also a sweet guy who clearly does not want to fight. He would much rather flee.

How do I keep them behaving when this behavior starts the moment she isn't distracted by treats?",DiceyDragon27,2022-11-22,03:00:46,2022,11,22,3,0,Tuesday

the 70g is with me giving her multiple reminders, to the extent of spoon feeding her the wet food. i’ve tried googling and trying out what google suggests, like heating up the food, changing type of wet food, adding dry to the wet food, adding her favourite treats in it, taking the food away and giving it to her a little later, but she either flat out rejects after a few bites, or just picks out the parts she likes. she leaves usually about half or a quarter of a bowl behind, no matter how much i reduce the food. even the can of food she likes the most, at times she’ll not eat it or she requires me to remind her that there is half left before she’ll eat. 

she is fed at set timings, 2 times kibble and 1 time wet food. the vet has cleared her of any health issues. she doesn’t seem to be losing weight, and is very active.

please help. i love her to bits but it’s been an extremely frustrating nightly affair getting her to finish the wet food. i’m afraid she’ll become underweight or have health problems because she doesn’t seem to be eating enough, based on what’s recommended. any advice would be greatly appreciated.",Natural-Ad9783,2022-11-22,00:12:13,2022,11,22,0,12,Tuesday

hes not allowed in closets, all shoes are put away, and we make any guests w laces take their shoes off at the door and im wary of buying anything electronic that has a string look. i do wanna mention that i make sure to monitor in the case he ingests any string. its like a compulsion he has, thats the best that i can describe it. 

i do play w him regularly, but im not dismissing that this may be a behavior of boredom. ive been considering getting a second cat so he has someone to play w when i cant. do u think this would help phase out this behavior? if anyone has gone thru this, do u have any advice besides what we're already doing?

When we found her she was skin and bones and very weak. But after getting some food in her she started showing her personality. She is 100% cat.

1,CatAdvice,Trouble with cat introduction!,"My boyfriend and I recently adopted a 5 year old cat (Bebe) and have had our resident cat (Bowser) for 2 years. We adopted Bebe almost 2.5 weeks ago and have been working on a gradual introduction. Things have been going mostly really great. We’ve gotten them to the point of eating directly in front of each other through a doo and have let them see each other from a distance. 

We started to move them into the same room a few days ago. We keep them both distracted and Bebe does great at first. Bowser (resident cat) is very perplexed by her and spends most of his time observing her play. He is comfortable enough to be briefly distracted by treats. 

This lasts roughly 15 mins before Bebe decides to randomly hunt Bowser and attack him. Nothing serious, just chasing, hisses, and swats. We separate immediately. My boyfriend has read that we should allow them to set boundaries like this, but I’ve read that we should always leave introductions on a positive note. Does anyone have insight on this or know why Bebe might randomly pouncing? Thanks!!!

1,CatAdvice,My cat will not stop peeing outside of the litter box,"Hi everyone,

I have a one year old cat who occasionally (once or twice a day) will pee outside of her litter box. She is spayed and according to her vet is healthy. She usually pees in front of doors, like the bathroom door if it is closed or my roommate's door or even the front door even though she does not like the outside. I've been trying to combat the issue by making sure to take her with me when I use the bathroom and my roommate is trying to do the same but recently I went on a trip and had to leave my cat with my roommate and the peeing got worse so now I'm looking for a long-term solution. 

The peeing started about a month after I adopted her (which would be march 2022). Around the same time she fell the bathtub while I was taking a bath. I don't know how significant of an incident it was but the peeing started around the same time. She isn't that squeemish of water nowadays so I don't think that is the reason for it. Also, my roommate moved in a little while after that. 

Here are the solutions I already tried:

1- Taking her with me to the bathroom and keeping doors open (which isn't always possible). 

2- Putting her in the litterbox after meals and after she sleeps. Works somewhat well, except for when I am at work or at night (so half of the time).

3- Changing litters. I use a clumping small pellet litter, which is what vets recommend for these kinds of issues. I scoop multiple times every day and change out the litter every month.

4- Changing her food. She gets wet food each morning and dry food throughout the day. Don't know what else I could do about that. 

She is overall a somewhat nervous cat. She will usually meow outside our doors whenever we close them and meow when we come back from the outside. I've also very briefly given Feliway (the spray version) a try and it seemed to work but I've read very mixed reviews and I wanted to ask here before committing to it. 

At this point I'm pretty desparate to solve this issue and would be open to any suggestions. If you have any questions or need more information, please ask. Thank you :)",eva_hrzg,2022-11-21,19:36:13,2022,11,21,19,36,Monday

1,CatAdvice,My girlfriend’s cat hates men?,So I know this sounds funny but my girlfriend has a female cat who is around 2 years old and she really dislikes men. She doesn’t have any problems with being petted by my girlfriend or her mother however whenever she is in the same room with my girlfriend’s father or younger brother she will start hissing and will run away if they try to pet her. She was also scared of me (20M) at first too and was hostile towards me but she got used to me being around (I’m a huge cat person so I was patient with her). However when a female friend of ours was introduced to the cat at the exact same time I was she had no problems cuddling together and showing physical affection.

And my partner doesn't care, does not try to engage with her, all he does is shush her or pspsps at her (which it does feck all).

1,CatAdvice,How to stop plucking,"I have 2 cats who have just turned 1 (they’re brothers from the same litter). 
While both of my cats enjoy plucking, cat A is satisfied with plucking the scratching posts we have around the house, but cat B loves to pluck the carpet, mainly the bottom of the stairs, and outside the ensuite. The plucking usually happens when I’m in the ensuite, early mornings and late at night (both usually when we are in bed). We even bought 2 new scratching posts for those areas. The new posts helped for a little bit, but now it’s worse than ever. I have tried playing with them throughout the day and especially at night to tire them out for bed but nothing is working anymore. I have a spray that stops them but I can’t spray the entire staircase, and it only works for a couple of hours. I am at the point where he gets put in a large dog cage (it has a bed in it) at night or else he keeps me up all night plucking. 

I would love some advice on what to do because I am at my wits end and he is causing damage to the carpet.",FridayJune,2022-11-21,09:34:55,2022,11,21,9,34,Monday

My female cat is 1.5 years old (spayed five months ago) and is very aggressive towards my boyfriend. He has two neutered 2 year old male cats at his house. They were friendly before she was spayed. Now she attacks him sometimes playfully but always aggressively. Scratching, hissing, deep growls. She’ll let him pet her if she’s very sleepy. She’ll let him play with her using a long stick toy. 

She’s quite friendly with everyone else but he spend the most time here. She’s like my shadow so maybe that’s part of it?

1,CatAdvice,Advice for Making Rehoming Easier,"I live in the US. I'm rehoming my 2 y/o, spayed cat tomorrow for many reasons, most importantly for not being able to afford to properly care for her anymore. I've had her since she was 8 months.

I love this cat &amp; it will be incredibly hard to say goodbye to her, but I'm also worried about the transition for her. She's a very anxious cat &amp; her vet said she needs anxiety medication along w home remedies for anxiety. She is a rescue who has been adopted &amp; returned to a shelter by someone before I adopted her. Shelter rescued her &amp; ker kittens living outside. Other history is unknown. I think she has abandonment issues.

I know the new owner somewhat; we are coworkers &amp; I trust he will take good care of her, better than I can, &amp; ik she will end up being happier with him. It's the right thing to do but does anyone have advice for things I can do to make the transition better? 

I'm going to give them all her toys, beds, favorite blankets, litter, food, treats, catnip she's used to, cat carrier, vet info. Anything else I can do?

1,CatAdvice,Renewed maternal instinct?,"My cat is acting weird. 

She gave birth to her first kitten 2 and half months ago. And just like any other mother cats, she was very protective and caring during the first few weeks. Won't let anyone touch/carry her kitten, hide her from us, etc. After 2 months, she's not protective anymore and the kitten is now basically a young cat that is now independent from the mother. 

Of course, these are all very normal but the weird thing is what's happening now. The mother cat gave birth to two new kittens this week. As normal, she's again being very caring and protective of the new kittens. 

But what's weird is that she became over protective again of the first cat. When she's away from her, she would come and pick her up by her neck or ear even though they're almost the same size now and would try to bring her back together with the two new kittens. 

Whenever we try to carry and play with the older kitten, the mother cat would come to us and would try to take her away. It's as if she thinks the older kitten is part of the newborns and her protective maternal instinct for the older cat got renewed? 

Just like other young cats, the first kitten is now very playful and keeps on running around. However, I think this is stressing the mother cat so much as she would always try to bring her back.

I'm thinking of getting the older kitten away from the mother in the meantime while she's still nursing the newborns?

Or maybe this is actually normal for the mother cat and not really concerning?",Elyard02,2022-11-21,07:54:55,2022,11,21,7,54,Monday

1,CatAdvice,Introducing a new kitten and my cat is being...confusing?,"So I rescued a little feral kitten, Basil, when she was 10wks old after she appeared my back deck. It has been about a month now and I've successfully been able to socialize her (although she still is a bit skittish) so now I'm starting the process of introducing her to my resident cat, Peaches.

Peaches is 5yrs old and my most beloved nightmare lol She I describe her as the poster child of ""single kitten syndrome"" and I have barely been able to improve her play aggression for the 4yrs I've had her 🥲 She still has the energy of a kitten, and I was contemplating getting her a kitten next year to maybe reduce the violent attacks on my legs, but hey! That's when Basil showed up!

I'm following Jackson Galaxy's method of introducing cats, but these two have accidentally come face to face before-- when I first trapped the kitten and was clearing a bathroom, I accidentally didn't shut the door right and they briefly sniffed each other's noses before I shooed Peaches away. Note that this is a shockingly good cat interaction for Peaches bc if she faces a cat outdoors through a window she typically screams like she's dying. The 2nd time they interacted was again, bc I'm terrible at shutting doors. I entered my office (where kitten is kept) to find Peaches staring intensely at the kitten like she was shocked that this creature was still here lol This time Peaches did hiss when she was picked up, but I think that's more because she was startled 😅

Now, this is where I am getting mixed signals. Room swapping? Not a problem; Peaches sniffed around at first but then just carried on with life. And it's the same thing with feeding on either side of the door! Peaches has no qualms with eating her food with Basil's bowl right up near her-- Peaches actually eats faster than the kitten, and when she's done eating she just walks away as usual! BUT the kitten recently discovered that she can fit her little paws underneath the door, and if Peaches sees her little paw, it's an immediate big hiss 😭? Idk how she can be okay with all the other steps day one, but a little paw and it's game over??

I feel bad for the kitten, bc she really wants to play with Peaches and will try to door-dash if she notices Peaches (Peaches does not notice her bc she is busy begging for the food I bring the kitten lol). Do I move on to the next step of eating with only a screen (or in this case, through the mesh of Basil's giant play pen) or is this a sign that things are going sour?

I'm super worried bc I'll be visiting my parents in a month and Peaches comes with me for that, but this time kitten will have to come with me too! I was so hoping Peaches would be more accepting of a baby cat but alas she still hates poor lil Basil 😢

1,CatAdvice,I’m moving! (And bringing my cat!),"Hello! I am not looking for any advice in particular, just hoping if anyone has any tips or tricks. My cat has been living with me at my parents house.

1,CatAdvice,Should I get a second cat (for my very adventurous and affectionate cat)?,"For some background: my 1.5 year old male tabby, Ivy, has been with me since I adopted him as a 9 week old kitten. He was the only kitten in the RSPCA enclosure who didn't run when he saw my 43 kg (95 lb) dog Isaac approach, and they were best friends within 10 minutes at home. Ivy goes right up to people when they visit, whether strangers or otherwise, loves pats from everyone. Goes for harnessed walks, even hangs out the car window on trips (harnessed to belt buckle, I promise). So he's a dog cat really. Adventurous, affectionate, smart, curious.

At home, it's been just Ivy and Isaac (who cuddle together all the time and play together occassionally), plus a house rabbit (Ivy would sometimes bully her during play but otherwise they left each other alone), who has since passed of old age. Ivy is an indoor cat but he's allowed access to a cat enclosure thing that allows him to go right to the fence. There, he calls SUPER loudly to the neighbour's cat to play and can often get quite upset when she doesn't show up.

His only semi extended interaction with a cat was when I recently took care of my friend's 1 year old shy female cat named Nyx for a week. Ivy was always very curious, patient, desperate to play but gave Nyx her space. They never quite got to cuddle levels because Nyx was very standoffish, but Ivy came close to winning her over. And Ivy was utterly heartbroken when the week was over and Nyx went back home. He wandered around the apartment looking dejected for a whole day. And he still goes to the fence daily for some cat interaction, which he doesn't always get.

My question is whether these are all signs that I should adopt another cat. I've read a lot of articles and posts warning about the difficulties, but in those cases, it seemed to be with a cat who was being introduced to another cat for the first time. So I was hoping for some tailored advice about my situation. Does the fact that Ivy seems to crave cat interaction mean I'll have a better chance of making a cat pair work? Would it be cruel not to try? (Okay ""cruel"" is a bit dramatic, but you know what I mean.) Even though Ivy is enthusiastic about a new cat friend now, will this fade over time and is there a chance they'll just get into fights later? Is Ivy and Isaac's occasional playtime enough to satisfy him?

For those who vote yes adopt another cat, any advice about age/sex etc? I personally think Ivy is a bit of a ladies' man and would love a female companion around his age, but I'm open to suggestions.

I would honestly prefer not to adopt another cat right now because I live in a small two-bedroom apartment with a giant dog and a cat, so I'd struggle for space. And the idea of adopting a cat only to find that it won't work out is quite stressful. But it also breaks my heart to hear Ivy calling out to the neighbour's cat to play and getting no response.

As a compromise, I was actually thinking of waiting until Isaac passes, since he's quite old, and adopting another cat then, to help both Ivy and myself grieve. This may not happen for several years, however, and I do feel bad for Ivy in the meantime.

Thanks to anyone who read through all that! Would love some advice from experienced cat owners tailored to my situation.",Dismal_Acanthisitta7,2022-11-21,06:48:37,2022,11,21,6,48,Monday

1,CatAdvice,Kitten (5 months) Attacks my 3 and 4 year old cats on sight. I Need help!,"5 months ago we found a kitty(Romeo) all alone on our farm. Decided to take him into our home as we couldn’t bring our selves to just leave him there. Very cute, innocent and tiny. He had fun with my other cats as he was smaller but now its getting out of hand as he is bigger and faster now

My other cats are Rick (4.5yrs old) and Cheeto (3.5yrs old) are very peaceful and sometimes play fight with each other. Now romeo, while he was tiny, would play fight with rick and cheeto as much as he could. Typical fun kitten behavior that was really fun/cute to watch. The problem now is Romeo with his kitten levels of energy is a little too crazy. He sprints full speed and attempts to mount both rick and cheeto on sight every day and every opportunity he gets. Rick is a stronger, more “alpha” cat while cheeto is the definition of a scaredy cat, pretty weak, innocent and affectionate which im totally fine with.

My problem is my other cats are starting to slightly change and I can tell sometimes they are distressed. My main concern is cheeto because romeo can smell the weakness off cheeto and enjoys what id consider bullying cheeto. Sometimes I catch him just growling when romeo is in the vicinity. I understand its the age difference and energy levels which contribute to the incompatibility but my family is starting to get annoyed and although they like romeo, due to his behavior they dont like him as much as the other cats because of his behavior. I can live with them not really playing with romeo as my family doesnt really know what goes into cat owner ship but I play with romeo 2 hours a day and it’s difficult playing with him that much just for his energy levels to be at 90% and launch at my other cats. Cheeto yelps is very vocal as he’s being chased as he runs and Rick play fights with romeo One out of every 10 times Romeo chases him. But when Rick is hissing telling him to f off essentially romeo doesnt stop, same with cheeto. Romeo always tries to bite the back of Rick‘s leg near his butt and it looks like Rick is really bothered by it.

I really need romeo to take it at least one step back and not bully my other cats. I really feel that romeo knows what hes doing is bad but he gets off to it. How do I get him to stop attacking cheeto on sight? I understand kittens are crazy but I think hes taking it too far. I keep cheeto in our big/nice basement with all his necessities with the door to upstairs closed as he spends most of his time down there anyway. 
It’s really difficult doing this on my own and I don’t want my family to continue being annoyed with him. I don’t know where to find a professional behaviourist or at least a reliable one. Will neutering Romeo bring this behaviour down a notch?

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you so much

TLDR: five month old kitten aggresively play attacks other three and four-year-old cats on site and I can tell they’re not enjoying it because they run and hiss and the 5 month old doesnt stop.

1,CatAdvice,Cat won't stop meowing when roaming around place where a kitten has been,"Hi everyone,

My significant other and her sister recently adopted a stray kitten 2 months ago. They've separated the kitten to be downstairs and their 6 year old cat upstairs.

They feel bad their older cat can't explore the house like she used to so they've tried bringing her downstairs (when the kitten isn't around) to explore but she's just constantly meowing. It's sounding like a sad meow too. Is there anything that can be down to help calm down when she's downstairs and explore more?

Any information would be very helpful!

For context the cats don't like each other. Although recently the older cat can be seen tolerating the kitten but will hiss and paw/attack the kitten if he comes too close to her or tries to ""play"".",Battledesert975,2022-11-21,04:52:22,2022,11,21,4,52,Monday

1,CatAdvice,My dad wants to get rid of our cats and I don't know how to feel,"I have 3 cats who have decided to become real bad recently. I make sure they have new litter weekly, and clean the litter they have daily

They would rarely ever use the bathroom outside of the litter box, like once a month max for the last few months, and then this month it started going down hill

They nearly daily use places other than the litter box. Important papers my dad needs, kitchen, living room, almost any piece of paper or plastic that gets left on the floor, no matter if there are things in it or not

He's telling me he's fed up, and I quote, ""I'll take them to the dog pound myself I don't care what anybody thinks I'm sick of it"" around an hour ago

Now I pay for food/litter mostly because he can't work with his disabilities, I work overnights so during the day I am asleep and not around them, he spends at least 5x more time with any of the cats than I do

I see where he's coming from and I know why he's upset and annoyed, I am too, and we don't really have the extra money to take any in to see if it's there's some issue they are having

I don't want to decide anything based on my emotions, so I just wanted to get some feedback on ideas/if he's right and we should re-home them or bring them in somewhere/what else I can do/anything, since I just don't know how to feel",Ya_boi_crispy,2022-11-21,04:18:03,2022,11,21,4,18,Monday

1,CatAdvice,My cat has asthma but the inhaler doesn’t seem to be working as well as I’d hoped. Am I doing something wrong?,"My cat was recently diagnosed with asthma &amp; Iv since had her on an inhaler. I give it to her twice a day (as recommended by the vet) but she still seems to have problems breathing.

Note: I use the adaptor for the inhaler I was provided which goes around her nose/mouth so she can breathe it in properly. 

I don’t use the wall plug ins that people say can cause issues, I do clean/vacuum regularly, have an air purifier - but even with all this &amp; the inhaler sometimes she still sounds like she’s struggling to breathe. 

She still eats / plays / acts fine for the most part. Again it just sounds like she’s struggling.

Is it possible I’m using the inhaler adaptor wrong? Or are there any other things I can do to help her? I read that steroids can cause issues long term but the only time she seemed to be doing the best was when she was first diagnosed &amp; was temporarily on them to help with the severity of her inflammation / lung issues

1,CatAdvice,I wanna get a cat but I've got some questions.,"Okay, so I want cats one day. I can't get them anytime soon, because my mother wouldn't allow it. I've already decided I'd like to get one in the future. I have many questions about this since I'm inexperienced. Also, this doesn't have to be the case, but I'd kinda like to just stay single... Would 3 cats be hard for a single, working person? I could go for 2 instead.

I've looked at some breeds and found some I really like, but would having a Maine Coon, Ragdoll, and a Snowshoe be hard/expensive/bad? Should I just go with less pricey/rare breeds?

Also, since I'll be single and working, I've read maybe 6 months would be the youngest age I could leave them as I work. Is this fine?

Would it be better to just adopt one? Or would it be hard to find?

1,CatAdvice,Reaching the end of my patience,"In short: got new cat, he's fairly young (little less than a year, don't know the exact age) and he's stubbornly getting into everything, and when I stop him he pisses on stuff he shouldn't 

I have a shelf in my room where I grow some plants under a grow light (there is no window!!) and he's become hellbent on getting up there--probably because he knows it gets my attention. I've done everything in my power to block off the shelf, and he still barges through it all, even if he falls or it's nearly impossible to make the jump. When I remove him from successful attempts, he finds something in my room other than the Two Whole Litter Boxes in the room to pee on. 

He's gotten along great with the other three cats, even plays with the younger two regularly. I thought he was doing this because he was restless, so I started playing hard with him before bed. Then I thought he was obsessed with the shelf because I kept the cat food in the cabinet, so I moved it out of the room. Finally  because he ended up getting up earlier than me, I decided to start opening my room door so he could go downstairs with the other cats while I finish sleeping. Nope, he still comes back in and tries to get up there, and once more when I remove him, he guns straight for my closet or chair to piss on something.

I'm at the end of my rope. I'm writing this after being woken up by him jumping up there AGAIN, and I've shut him out before I boot him from here to the moon, but that's not a long term strat either because my other cats favourite litter box is in here. I honestly do not know how to manage this behaviour, and any advice would be great before I wring his skinny little neck (this is hyperbole, I would never harm any of them, but boy does he fucking test me)

Feel free to ask for more details, too. If it's relevant, I suspect he's albino and he certainly seems to have some vision issues. Vet appts are booked to high hell in my area, so while I'm certain it's behavioural his soonest checkup isn't until January so I can't make an easy visit there either.",FatalBlow9,2022-11-20,23:17:20,2022,11,20,23,17,Sunday

1,CatAdvice,HELP! I need advice. New Cat moved in.,"for context if anyone needed: 

Manju (Mauhn-Jew) • Male • 18 months • Feral • had since four months old • adopted Sep. 19. 2021 (First Kitty)

Peanut is Butter • Female • 20 months • Spaded • had since 6 months old • adopted Oct. 11. 2021 (Second Kitty)
 
Fae • Female • 14 months • Spaded • had since 13 months old • adopted Oct. 14. 2022 (Our New Kitty)

Midnight • Neighbors cat who is always at our house, eats &amp; sleeps here most of her time • Female • about 8 months old • Unsure about being Spaded • Neighbor found her at 2 weeks old, been coming here since four months old • (Not ours but came in as Third Kitty) 

So our new kitty, who we had for a little more than a month, keeps being bullied terrorized by our first cat Manju. Manju is usually the most friendliest of all cats, &amp; of all the cats we thought Manju would be the first person to take to her, but he wasn’t. Everytime he sees her, he makes his shoulders big &amp; turn into a gorilla &amp; chases her down looking like he has gorilla shoulders &amp; smacks her, with claws. I’m not joking, he actually resembles a gorilla. i know it’s him showing dominance. My bestfriend says he’s getting “bigger” because she made him feel “small” when he was trying to get to know her.

in reality, i know I made a few mistakes when introducing.

1. Fae was in the house when Manju was outside laying &amp; playing around (gone) with the other cats in the backyard. so he wasn’t home when she arrived.
2. I wasn’t aware of Fae’s personality before I adopted her. now i do see that plays a big major role. (learned alot of lessons this last adoption) her personality is very scary. Like she’s extremely scared of everything. i think before the person she was adopted from. (it was an older lady who had Fae since about 7 months, so she had her for about 6 months before we adopted her, said that Fae is the only cat she was allergic to &amp; had to give her away but didn’t want to surrender her to a shelter. after she gave Fae to us, she got a new cat the following week &amp; says that she’s not allergic to this one.) Fae doesn’t really have any extremely concerning behavior issues, but she is scared of everything. When Manju is out the house, she free roams, smells everyone’s butts weirdly a lot, loves to play, loves to be pet, doesn’t really socialize a lot , very to herself most of the time, all movements &amp; noises scare her. I think before the last woman, she was somewhere where she had to fend for herself &amp; it was dangerous. I would say, most times it’s not dangerous in our house but it does get a little worrysome whenever Manju wants to attack her. This happens about 2-3 a day. 
3. When Manju met Fae, for two days he would go up to her sniff her &amp; always lay by her. Later on the second day, he was smelling her face again, she hissed at him, swatted him &amp; ever since then he’s been going gorrilla mode every single time he sees her.

Peanut Butter doesn’t really care about Fae too much, Manju hates her, Midnight plays with her a lot &amp; Fae plays back but Fae body slams her a lot &amp; Fae plays extremely hard, so I’m always confused if they are playing or it’s serious. 

All of the other cats go outside, lay in the sun, climb the trees, lay on our roofs, play in the grass, &amp; Fae watches them from the window all the time. Fae is too scared to go outside. 

I feel like is Fae wasn’t as scared &amp; more free flowing she would have gotten along well with everyone but She’s extremely scared. Now I feel like she’s found herself in an environment, that she’s not always getting attacked but it does happen. She definitely feels happier when everyone’s outside because she freeroams, She’s free roaming the house when Manju is outside, &amp; the other cats are inside.

But i’m reality, i’m just concerned &amp; dk what to do. I’ve tried to get them both to accept eachother, but Fae will just swat at him when he isn’t doing anything &amp; he’ll turn into a fucking gorilla &amp; swat her when he sees her. 

Honestly i feel like she’ll do better in a home where there’s no other cats. but i also don’t want her to just be passed around because she’s been going home to home but now in my home, she’s not fully safe whenever Manju decides he just wants to go gorilla.

I would love to find a solution to how to make them co-exist but i’m starting to feel like it’ll just be better to give her to someone who can provide a better home for her, a safer home.",TheWallflowerAvatar,2022-11-20,19:50:02,2022,11,20,19,50,Sunday

1,CatAdvice,I'm scared my cat won't recognise me,"For context, one of the requirements for my university degree is to spend a few months (at least three) abroad (which is classicist gatekeeping in the first place imo, but we're not focusing on that right now). 

Anyways, I'm two and half months into my semester abroad, and will be back in the middle of December. My cat has been staying at home with my roommates the entire time, because I couldn't take him with me and also didn't want to put the stress of moving on him. My roommates have been caring for him perfectly and also send me pictures every week or so. I'm not worried at all about him not being cared for. What I *am* worried about is him just completely forgetting about me. 
He's a typical ""covid baby""; he was born during the first year of the pandemic and as a consequence I was stuck at home with him for the first few months, meaning he's very used to me being there for him *all the time*. In the past, my roommates have said that when I leave for my parents' for a weekend or so, he will scream for me for a day before finally calming down. As soon as I came back, he'd be at the front door, screaming for me and checking I'm okay before ignoring me for a day or two (out of spite?

I am scared that he will do this again, but longer, since I've never left for such an extended period of time before. I'm also scared he will have forgotten about me entirely.

1,CatAdvice,Need advice on leaving cats at home with a drop in visitor for a month,"Hello people
I need some advice on how to plan for my 2 cats while I’m away on a month long trip back at my parents’ in India (jan-feb). I currently live in Ontario Canada. I have 2 cats - 2.5 and 1.5 year old male neutered. I am speaking to friends as well but in case they cant watch them i need to plan for a backup option. My brother was supposed to watch them but he may he starting a job in another city. I have a roommate too and she has been good to feed them sometimes but she goes to stay with her bf sometimes and she may not be down to look after them religiously for a month. She also works 12 hours a day on the weekends. 
If boarding them with my friends or my brother doesnt work out, my plan is to get a house visit 1 or twice a day (from Rover) to feed them and pick up their litter. They might get some human interaction n will get to stay in their home instead of being relocated. Is this too less for a month? They dont need a ton of entertainment and I’ll make my peace with it till im back. Price wise this would be expensive, 40-50 bucks a day :( i need some advice on how to proceed with this.

I had a cat that I loved more than anything and whenever I left to go to my Dad's, my mom would always do a shitty job at taking care of him so he would try and run after me and just get lost. Whenever I came back I would find him being taken care of by these 2 kids down the street and bring him home.

One day in the cold of winter  I came back to my Mom's and went down to the kid's house and he wasn't there, I haven't seen him since.

It's been a little over a year now and I've been wanting another cat, I don't want to make the same mistake again--so I thought of just taking them with me.

I live 7 days with my mom and 7 days with my dad,

1,CatAdvice,Is it too soon to take him to the vet?,Short story. A (what my girlfriend and I believe to be) stray cat has been coming around our home for around 2 months on and off. No collar. No neighbors seem to think that he has an owner. We've left food and water for him many times and he eats and drinks very fast like he'd been starving/dehydrated. More recently it has been getting cold where we live. Today around 20F or -6c. He was at our house from when i left at 2pm until I arrived home at 10pm. We decided to try and let him in the house to warm him up and give him some more water. We would absolutely love to adopt him as our 2nd cat. He's very calm and loving once we got him into our home. We're just not sure where to go from here as we've never adopted a stray. Do we try and let him get accustomed to the home and our other cat before doing things like taking him to the vet for shots/checkup/getting him neutered.,reynadsaltynuts,2022-11-20,13:33:24,2022,11,20,13,33,Sunday
1,CatAdvice,"Our 8 and 6 month old strangers got along instantly after being introduced, is this not common?","Hey all. My fiance and I adopted two kittens back in June, one was 8 months old (Brown Tabby), the other (lynx point Siamese domesticated mix), 6 months. I sit here watching our two girls groom each other as inspiration for this post. 

We visited our local shelter back in June and fell in love with these two kittens. While they both came from Texas, they never actually interacted and obviously came from different litters. 

I see people here say that it takes days to weeks to introduce cats. Well...we didn't wait, and did not ease into it at all. We were going to, but just felt as if we didn't need to. 

When we brought them home into our home, we put their cages face to face for about 30 seconds. Then, we let them out of their cages. They sniffed each other, and within, without exaggeration, a minute, they were chasing, tumbling, playing and clearly having a blast and were obviously enjoying socializing. The tabby gave a quick hiss after about 10 minutes...the other kitten respected the boundary, sat for a bit, then they continued playing. They got along so well, that we felt okay leaving them alone in a room together over night! 

We woke up the next morning for work to find them cuddling. Fast forward 5 months, and nothing has changed. They love each other and are the best of friends. They still play and tumble and chase and groom. The tabby will usually give a hiss when she doesn't want to play, and the Siamese mix always respects the boundary and there's never been any hard feelings. 

As I read more about this, I see most people take weeks to introduce their cats. Maybe we weren't wise to introduce them immediately, but I've never seen two cats get along like this. 

Is this uncommon? And if so, why may they be an exception?",Mr_Driver_1992,2022-11-20,13:31:14,2022,11,20,13,31,Sunday

1,CatAdvice,Advice on taking in a cat not using his litter box!,"(posted also in r/cats)

Hi,

A friend of mine has a neighbor with an 8 year old male cat who has not been using his litter box for a few months and has been relieving himself on the sofa, in his cat carrier, etc. instead. He's only recently started doing so for about two months, although he's been house-trained and had been good about using the litter box until then. They took him to the vet to get him checked out health-wise--apparently he's fine, and the vet suggested that there may be an environmental factor. The neighbor is an elderly lady who has some dementia issues, so it's likely that she had been unable to properly take care of him. They've also reached out to the local cat rescue agency, but they want the cat to be chipped and fully vaccinated before taking him in. The elderly lady wasn't sure of how many vaccines the cat had received and likely does not have enough money to pay for getting him chipped, etc.

I'm considering taking in the cat to see if he can fare better in a less chaotic situation, but wanted to ask for advice on how to prepare myself in taking in a likely very stressed out cat with litter box issues (Aka, how to prepare him to get adjusted to the new stressors of moving, what things would be best to entice him to use the litter box, what materials would be best to clean cat waste, etc.). I would also be happy to hear of any other potential avenues forward for this kitty.

Any and all help would be appreciated! Just want to help this little guy out.",Glittering-Peach2333,2022-11-20,10:11:10,2022,11,20,10,11,Sunday

1,CatAdvice,Most affordable and effective way to treat feline asthma?,"I have taken my cat to the vet many times for her asthma and it does not seem like the liquid prednisone she’s taking now is helping. My vet suggested a steroid inhaler but the price tag is a little high ($240) 

I am willing to pay to treat her, but I don’t see much feedback online about this inhaler and I am skeptical about continued use of steroids. She is only 3 and while I want to extend her life with asthma, I don’t want to shorten it with daily steroid use either (especially because they don’t even seem to be working) 

Side note, I initially thought this was all a food allergy as her coughing was coupled with constipation. She was eating nutro at the time. My vet switched her to Royal Canin gastrointestinal high fiber food and said to give her .25 teaspoon miralax daily. Her poops are less flat. I gave her the miralax for a few months and but discontinued, concerned about the side effects of long time use, and there has been no change in her stool or coughing since stopping. I feel like my vet could have put a bandaid on things and that a food allergy could still be an underlying issue. Sharing these details in case anyone here has been through something similar.

I truly hope that’s not true, so I’m coming to Reddit for advice on how to help my cat feel more secure and confident and what steps we can take to help her. 

Now, I don’t know if this is separation anxiety. However, what leads me to believe it is, is that she only howls like that when someone she’s bonded with leaves the apartment.

1,CatAdvice,my kitty is suddenly very distant,"ive been pondering about whether or not this is an actual concern or if I'm just being super sensitive cuz im attached to the cat haha. i have an almost 7 month boy who was an absolute sweetheart from the day i brought him home. he was very clingy, he would always need to be in my vicinity or touching me somehow. if i was sitting on the floor, he would crawl into my lap; if i was laying on the couch, he would be too. he was very vocal and liked to talk/ yell. he also loved to sleep with me, as close to my chest as possible. the last three days, hes been very withdrawn and nothing like himself. very quiet &amp; independent. something to consider is that he was neutered 3-4 weeks ago. 

i know cats can get more independent the older they grow but the change in behavior seems very sudden. he's eating fine and is still the food obsessed guy he's always been. this is my first experience with having a cat and im worried about missing signs that would be obvious to others. anyways, is this change in behavior normal for a kitty that's been recently fixed or am i just being sensitive?

1,CatAdvice,14 y/o diabetic outdoor cat won't go in winter shelter,"Hey,
So I built a shelter for winter out of reflexive styrofoam in a plastic bin with a 6 inches opening. He fits in snuggly but won't go in. I tried putting treats and catnip inside, he still won't. Any tips to get him to use it? 

I'd really like it since he still likes to go outside even though it's freezing and there's a lot of snow. He's good for coming back in time for his insulin shots, but I still would like him to have a shelter outside so he can stay out as long as he would like (and because sometimes he runs out when were not careful, even if it's not the best time for him to be outside).

1,CatAdvice,How to introduce a new cat over the weekend?,"Hi all. I live alone with my cat (3 years old female, scared of everything, even shopping bags) and my girlfriend usually comes to stay the weekend. She lives alone too , and now she wants a cat. 

I've seen some videos on making a cat get used to a new cat. But my girlfriend wants to bring her soon to be new cat in here during the weekend. How would that work in the feline mind? I'm afraid this new friend coming and going routine could be bad for her in terms of stress. If she doesn't get used to the new cat, it will be a huge stress everytime he comes around. If my cat gets attached to her new friend, I think she would suffer from this situation too. I'm afraid the weekend won't be enough for the new cat to be seen as much more than an invader, the presentation process as shown in the videos is longer ...any input on this? 

For additional information, my cat is not social, I rescued her during COVID-19 times, and the only times she interacted with other cats she was really territorial.",mtargab,2022-11-20,03:00:53,2022,11,20,3,0,Sunday

1,CatAdvice,Introducing two cats after an almost fight - help!,"I have a 5 month old kitten named Mo that is extremely high energy and while I play with him all the time, he really needs another outlet. A few days ago, I adopted a 10 month old male cat named Vinny in hopes that I could successfully introduce them. Vinny has lived with both a dog and another cat before without big problems. 

I live in a 1 bedroom apartment and have a door shut that essentially splits the apartment in two to keep them separated. Unfortunately I need to go through the door a lot, and the kitten has been growling and hissing outside the door intermittently. The older cat snuck out behind me today and a fight almost ensued. Luckily I was able to separate them before it came to blows, but now I feel like we’re back to square one. 

Any and all advice would be really helpful! How do I help reset things between the two of them and how long might this take now? I know it could be weeks :/",velodeviation,2022-11-20,01:51:50,2022,11,20,1,51,Sunday

1,CatAdvice,Traveling with cat,"I have been going back and forth on this. I will be traveling for 3 weeks for Christmas and the New Year via a 3-hour flight. I originally planned to bring my cat with, then changed my mind and thought it would be better to get a sitter. Well, a sitter for that long is a big charge and I haven't even been able to find someone willing to watch him during the dates. I am traveling to visit my parents, who have two golden retrievers. I don't think my cat has ever been around dogs before. My plan was to keep him in my room but he would hear the dogs crying from outside the door. I am so torn on what to do. Is it better to board him somewhere near my apartment than to take him on a flight to a new place? Or keep him with me so he has some sense of normalcy? I don't want the poor guy to feel abandoned.

For context-- I got my cat at the end of August, he was very skittish (and still can be). He recently started head butting and asking to be pet which is amazing progress. I'm terrified of bringing him on a plane to a new place for only three weeks and ruining all of the progress we've made.

If anyone has some advice, how to find a sitter from Christmas week to after New Years, etc., please give some insight!!",EPeagles17,2022-11-20,00:26:54,2022,11,20,0,26,Sunday

1,CatAdvice,"Ex's cat loves me, how to separate from kitty?","TLDR: My ex's cat  loves me and is constantly crying for my attention, but my ex is moving out in a few months. I feel terrible ignoring the cat, I love the cat, but I'm worried the cat will be a terror to my ex after he moves out. How do I make this process easier?

Rambling version: My ex and I split after 7 yrs (amicable) and we have 3 cats (all fixed). 

2 (male and female) are mine from before we started dating, 1 (male) is his who we got as a kitten 2 yrs ago. His cat LOVES me. Constantly cries for me to play with him. Gets destructive if I don't. Extremely high energy boy, needs a lot of exercise and play. One of the smartest cats I've had in my life. 

Recently I stopped playing with him, and instead I tell my ex he needs to play with his cat (which he does, but usually distracted by his phone or only for 5 mins at a time, so cat comes to me after). I'm trying to ""wean"" the cat off of me so that he isn't a destructive terror when my ex moves and it's just them. 

I feel absolutely terrible though. I love this kitty and it breaks my heart to hear him crying all the time. I can't tell if I'm doing the right thing or not. Should I be separating myself from the cat, or should I just keep giving him attention as normal? I've heard horror stories about cats missing their owners and becoming destructive and I don't want that to happen.",baerwolf,2022-11-19,23:34:55,2022,11,19,23,34,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,So this is gonna be a long story but please read it all,"     So to begin, I'm in my 3rd home at 17y/o with my truly extraordinary catto named Rocky. Due to some unfortunate circumstances we were forced to leave said 3rd home and in doing so my family had split apart and started doing their own things. From this event I had to move very very suddenly into my new home (of which my room is miniscule and is the only room Rocky can be in, explanation for this further down). Here is some backstory on my new home and the animals that live here. 

     So during Rocky's first 3-4 years of life he was steadily gaining privilege to go outside unsupervised. (I live in coyote and raccoon territory and God knows what else, so I had trained him to come back into my home before dark and to let him out after dawn for his further safety.) Now I will introduce 2 other cats that are a large issue, A older but 1.5x larger cat than Rocky, named Buddy, and another 1.25x larger black cat named Jet (Rocky is about 12.5lbs for reference as to these cats sizes). These 2 would always antagonize Rocky whilst he was outside so they absolutely hate each other.

      Now to where this all comes together, so the home I was forced to move into, the lady/roommate/landlord Kim owns 1 dog and somewhere between 7-9 different cats. 2 of those also happen to be Buddy and Jet. So from this sudden move into a shoebox sized room with my indoor with outdoor privileges cat where I am near forced to contain him solely to my room. He has been neutered as well and so has Jet and Buddy, and he has 24/7 fresh accomodations so he doesnt feel as bad about being stuck in my room. 

     Yet, regardless of this, I can still tell he's depressed and anxious and longs to go outside. I live in a mountainous region where we will likely get snow consistently soon from the winter storms. I was planning on constructing a catio for him and still think that's a good plan, but I want knowledge of every option at my disposal as to, hopefully, help Rocky be happier. I don't think I can leash train him in my room as of the extremely small size but I'm not sure so that's why I'm asking these questions on here. 

     His depression, in turn, makes mine worse in all aspects, as whilst he isn't a registered support animal, he basically is for me and him being in any discomfort or sadness or anything of that sort heightens my problems, whilst also not knowing what to do about it or how to fix it and I need this to stop for both him and me so we both can have a healthy future. Thank you for reading this, please let me know about any and all methods of solving this problem for me.",August6th1945,2022-11-19,21:33:38,2022,11,19,21,33,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,Concerned on if Cat is getting enough hydration,"I'm a bit worried about whether my 1 year old cat is getting enough hydration as I don't see her drink that much. She has a wide water bowl (to avoid her whiskers touching the side) and a pet fountain but I've never seen her drink from the fountain (just try and hit the water with her paws lol). I stayed buying her bottled mineral water and she seems to drink from her bowl a bit more now but not that often, the water level doesn't go down much.

Her diet consists of 1 and a half 100g pouches of wet food a day with some dry food to graze on. She's a very small cat and doesn't eat much but I'm considering upping her pouches to 2 a day with less dry food. Would 1.5 to 2 pouches provide enough hydration that she doesn't need to drink much or is this a problem?

My main questions right now are, is she likely getting enough water with the wet food already or:

1) Should I try adding water to her wet food?

2) Should I add more wet food if she seems to be a healthy weight? She's filled out a little bit but seems to be a good size for her age, I'm worried about her getting chubby

3) Should I keep trying with the fountain or is there no point if she prefers the bowl? I'm considering selling it but not if it's worth it for her.",Sporshicus,2022-11-19,10:57:06,2022,11,19,10,57,Saturday
1,CatAdvice,How should I introduce our cat to these kittens?,"/Putting this under the 'Behavioral' flair but please let me know if I should be using a different one/

So, we have two in-house cats, Beef(female &amp; neutered) and Kathrine(female &amp; unknown)- but Beef originally came to us as practically feral and very young. We got her fixed, medicated, etc.

Another cat(Spicy Chicken) who looks like Beef in coloring and age and we're pretty sure that they're from the same litter- has finally warmed up to us and has given birth in our indoor porch area. We likely won't be able to keep Spicy Chicken as she's our neighbor's cat (though I say screw them for neglecting her yet still claiming ownership of her) but in the meantime we want the kittens to stay with us since it's getting pretty cold out. And this is actually the second time Spicy Chicken has been pregnant but we're pretty sure that none of the kittens from that litter made it as we saw no signs of them. The worry I have is Kathrine, she's lovely and sweet but not great with other cats and has shown some aggression toward Spicy Chicken in the past. I'm worried that she might not be cool with the kittens but it'll be inevitable that they'll meet.

So, are there any tips for introducing them? Or even getting them to get along together? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!&lt;3",applesareokaytbh,2022-11-19,10:57:04,2022,11,19,10,57,Saturday

The first interaction for the most part has gone great as my new cat has no interest in my resident cat beyond just smelling her. My resident cat does hiss or growl if she gets too close but shows no other signs of aggression (swatting, fighting, hair raising, tail getting all poofy, her ears and eyes are calm as well). Will the hissing stop or should I be worried? They've been together for a long time today and no fighting has ensued by either parties.",43pluto,2022-11-19,10:38:26,2022,11,19,10,38,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,Which foster kitten to adopt? I love them all! 😒," So back in July I trapped a litter of 5 kittens. I trapped their mother as well and had her fixed and released her (she was feral). Kittens were about 6 weeks old at the time and feral and oh so spicy! I have 2 cats of my own, so I have been taking care of 7 cats for about 4 months now. I’m 7.5 months pregnant and due in January, so I know I will need to give them up at some point. 
I have been rehabilitating them since July and getting them used to people. These kittens were so skittish and shy and still even after 4 months, really need work. I have come to realize that they need more help than I can provide. I have been working with an amazing organization and regularly attending adoption events to try and get them adopted- I have been consistently giving up my weekends to volunteer at these events. 2/5 have been adopted and returned. So the organization offered to let me move them to the adoption center and have a variety of people come in 2x per day to take care of them in order to socialize them. 
These kittens and I have been through a lot together - so Im really attached to them- all of them not just one in particular. I love them all in different ways. I rescued them, rehabilitated them, been through 2 rounds of ringworm with them, loved them, cared for them, fed them, etc for the last 4 months. So, I would like to keep one of them. There are 2 in particular that I have narrowed it down to. One of them a male tabby that you would never know was ever feral. My kids love him and he is great with them. The other a female gray tabby that loves our family but nobody else, really. 
Which one should I keep? 
With the female, I worry about behavior issues when I leave town or have strangers in the home. But I also worry that the female has only ever bonded with me and will never give anyone else a chance. 
I don’t worry about the male, he will be ok wherever he goes - here or adopted out. 
Do I take the female who I know is bonded with us and will likely have a harder time being adopted out? Or take the easier male that everyone in our home loves? 
Im super hormonal and have been crying over the thought of giving them up, but ultimately, I know that I have taken them as far as I can on my own in their socialization journey. I know giving them up is best. I want to keep one but I’m not sure which one. Please help me decide by Sunday! Thank you",Aromatic-Rate6794,2022-11-19,09:45:45,2022,11,19,9,45,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,Cat Vomits After Eating Weight 8 lbs,"(Already been to the veterinarian for this)

I have a short hair domestic black cat that's 6 yrs old. This issue just started this year. I had my cat checked for intestinal obstruction which everything was fine and no obstruction. I had the cats blood tested for parasites and feline leukemia and both negative. I began giving him this $68 high protein cat food from vets office and he still continued to vomit but not as often. Then he lost 2 lbs. I don't understand what's going on. He has no health problems, an entire 5 years never an issue like this till this year. While losing 2 pounds most his body fat is gone too. 
He drinks plenty of water, uses the bathroom still, plays with the other cat I have and seems to be happy and playful still. What bothers me is the fact he's healthy still while to me seems sickly because of the weightloss. All his shots are up to date as well as the other cats.

1,CatAdvice,need advice on a hard choice for grooming my adopted fam’ adopted cat,"i currently try to use a purple furminator cat brush to take the snags out of his coat/undercoat every day if i can. i try to switch off between a positive interaction with him, like petting him  scratching him letting him smell and bump me, and a negative interaction like the furminator. when i approach with the furminator i try to give a nice scritch with my hand where i want to brush, then show him the furminator, go over it as much as he lets me with the furminator but within a few strokes of the brush he’ll usually start turning to bap or bite at me and i pull away. if he gets upset once but doesn’t seem too terribly offended then i sit for about a minute and then repeat the scritch, show, brush routine. sometimes he’ll let me go at another brushing or two but other times he decides to be done by moving away or instantly reacting every time i bring the brush to his coat.

he is an 18 year old male, domestic-mainecoon mix. he has an average to nice connection to me and is a little closer with my partner and her dad. but he’s only been in the family for two years, i’ve only been around one.  he was adopted from what we’re pretty sure was a bad situation where he was declawed but that could have been done to him at any point we don’t know for sure but the point is he isn’t really fully trustful of any of us in the family. i don’t want to violate his trust and have to restrain while i brush out the matts but i’m worried i’m being selfish by not just crossing his boundary to fix the thing that’s causing him discomfort.",janesayssssss,2022-11-19,08:41:39,2022,11,19,8,41,Saturday
1,CatAdvice,In need of advice: Reactive dog and potential kittens,"I have a reactive dog at home and I need some suggestions for how to quickly make sure that he gets adjusted to kittens. My roommates and I are planning to adopt 2 kittens next year to take care of in our apartment. Two of my three (four including myself) roommates have experience with kittens, so taking care of them shouldn't be a problem. My concern lies back home. My family dog is an anxiety riddled five year old miniature Australian Shepherd. He has always had issues with other animals and people, often barking and growling at any sudden movements, but adjusts relatively quickly. He's never had issues with attacking other animals except for the occasional nip at other dogs at the park when they get too close to me (he's a big barker and chaser as he's a herding dog). Despite this knowledge, I'm unsure how he'd react to a cat, especially kittens. He's never been around one before, the only non-dog interaction was a bunny that he didn't care much about. Ideally I wouldn't take the risk of introducing him to kittens, especially since I intend to get them from a local rescue, but I am obligated to get them registered as Emotional Support Animals. I have depression and have struggled a bit this year without my dog to keep me company. The apartment complex we will be staying in is one of the few locations that we will be allowed to stay in next year, and the only one that doesn't require a subway. They don't allow normal pets, but they do allow ESAs (Emotional Support Animals). I initially intended to get a dog, but my roommates and I agree that cats would likely be easier. Due to them having to be registered as my ESAs, and my roommates being unable to take them home, I have no choice but to taken them home over winter break, and any other long term break.

I've been considering the idea of bringing the kittens home 2 weeks before the semester start date to get them adjusted to my dog. I'm hoping that if they're introduced at a young age, even for a short period of time, that their inevitable reintroduction for winter break will be much less stressful. I'm sure that a longer introduction period would be better but I need to work most of the summer to make enough money to last me through the semester, and support the two new babies! I was wondering if two weeks would be enough, and how to ensure that my dog and kittens meeting goes as seamlessly as possible. I've read quite a bit about slow exposure, so I've been planning to do that. I'm mostly concerned that since he barks quite a lot that they could end up traumatized.

Another concern I have is how to avoid damage to the apartment furniture. Is there a way to keep cats from scratching, and potentially damaging the furniture? I wouldn't normally have an issue (my dog is very destructive) but the apartment comes pre-furnished. Any product recommendations, training, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!

I also want to know how much attention kittens likely will need!! They will be coming from a foster home so I'm not sure if that would make a difference. I will try and make as much time for them as possible, but life gets in the way and my dog is quite needy so there might be times where I have to leave them with a family member or alone for periods of time. I want to ensure that they get as much love as possible :)

I'm not planning to get them until late August, I don't even know what they look like (we do have a vision of two male cats: a black one named Noctis, and a brown one named Leon, but we aren't too picky). I just want to make sure I'm not making any mistakes and that I'm as prepared as possible!! Also! Any product recommendations like litters boxes, carrying cages, and towers would be lovely!! I also will be posting this on a few boards just in case. Thank you so much for taking your time to read this and I hope everyone has a phenomenal day!!",N1K1TA-,2022-11-19,08:37:32,2022,11,19,8,37,Saturday
1,CatAdvice,Litter boxes for cats in a shared house,I have 2 cats and I would like to take both with me when I move out my parents house. And my mom is the getting a new house for me in to live in and she's going to rent out the other rooms. My mom said I can only put litter boxes in my room and my bathroom. My mom says it's not appropriate to put a litter box in the living room or any other public/shared space of the house. She says she can't rent it with a litter box in the living room that's not fair to roommates. But with 2 cats I need at least 3 litter boxes and it's usually better to spread them out it I think.

1,CatAdvice,Newly aggressive cats,"This is a weird story, I think. It started last night. 

I have two cats: Rosie is 5 and my sensitive girl. She's very sweet, but skittish and scares kind of easily, but that's actually been getting better. Then there's Phinley: my sweet, funny boy. He turned 2 in July. He likes to play a little more rough than she does, but they seemed to have figured that out. She actually plays by herself when she's in the mood. He's the same way now. There's never been much strife between them that I could see, except for once when Rosie (I think) came back from a dental cleaning last year and he treated her like a complete stranger for several days. They hissed and growled at each other, and made that weird noise that cats make when they're freaked out; that lar-a-lar-a-lar noise. We also just got back home from 9 months in California. They were fine there, but Rosie wasn't happy. She just slept a lot in her little scratcher bunker. She's been a lot better since we've been home. Happier, more comfortable and content. My girl. 

So last night, I was sitting in bed while she was curled up in my lap asleep. Phinley was in his little cavern bed on the floor, maybe 5 feet from the bed. All of the sudden, Rosie jerked awake and flew up into the air like something scared the hell out of her. Or hurt her. She took off for the living room as soon as she hit the floor, with Phinley right behind her. When I walked out there, I found him half wedged under the chair, and heard growling and hissing, so she was under the chair as well. That's one of her safe spots. So he hears me and crawls back out. I figured she needed a minute (or several), so Phin and I chilled in the bedroom again to give her time. Then I went to check on her. She was in a different spot, and when she saw Phin, she hissed and growled and ran up the cat tree. He took off after her and made that weird warble sound. I hadn't heard that in a while. 

Basically, it's still like this. I kept him in the room with me until about 5am and kept the door closed. She cried all night and they kind of played with each other under the door. It's a weird apartment and the bottom of the door leaves a good sized gap between it and the floor. At 5am, I opened the door to feed them and take my meds. She busted through the opening door and jumped over him, then onto her other perch. He immediately followed her and stared up at her, making that warbling noise again. So I picked her up to get her out safely and when I started to walk out, I felt his claws kinda dig into my legs. Wtf. Like he was trying to get at her. 

Eventually I was able to call the vet and they said to let them figure it out, but to be aware so that I could douse them in water or throw a blanket on them if needed. Ok. I let them see each other. She was in her favorite spot in the back of the apartment. I switched their areas earlier and slept in the living room with him. She's better about being left alone. They've both eaten and done their litter box stuff by this time. Anyways, I open the door and he immediately makes a beeline towards her. She growling, ears down, in the defensive stance on top of the dresser where she loves to sleep. He made that warble noise and is aggressively rubbing all over the spot he's on, occasionally staring her down. Mostly flopping all over and rubbing. Idk if this is a territorial / hierarchy thing, but it was weird. At one point, he did jump up to her spot and they threw paws at each other, spat, hissed, growled. He backed off then; but even now, 7 hours later, he's still trying to approach her and she's clearly not having it. I just picked up two multicat feliway kits and dosed him with gabapentin per the vet instructions. I can't get her to take it and she's under the bed. But wtf? 
Cats are weirdos. Loveable, funny, charming weirdos.

1,CatAdvice,Tips on trapping a stray in my cat trap for vet visit.,"I've been leaving the trap latched open and moved her regular feeding spot to the entrance of the trap. I tried moving the food bowls back a little everyday but today i guess they were too far back and she wouldn't eat or go in any further than half her body. She has a snipped ear so has been trapped before is my guess and is weary of them. 

I'm wondering if my trap is too small. I will admit money is tight so i got the cheap one from tractor supply that is big enough for her but its not super roomy. If i were to get a larger sized trap would the chances of her going in enough to trigger it go up with the additional space or would it be a waste of money?

Additional info: I have a motion camera on the trap so ill know if she triggers it so she wont be out there long in the elements. I've read that covering the trap with a towel might help but i tried that one day and it didnt seem to do any good.",Lumpy_Sheepherder732,2022-11-19,03:17:56,2022,11,19,3,17,Saturday

She's fixed, no changes to her environment, the vet has ruled out health causes, and the only other animal in the house is my Chihuahua who she's known her whole life. 

We have tried over cleaning her cat box, changing litters, changing foods, changing the location of the box. Nothing has worked.

She does 1 &amp; 2 in her cat box usually but is seemingly spite peeing on soft surfaces. She peed on the couch last night which I cleaned thoroughly with enzymatic cleaner. This morning she peed on the blanket at the other end of the couch. Both times staring me dead in the eyes. She has peed on our bed and spare blankets in the past. She goes a month or two without issues then does this a couple times a day for about a week straight. 

I read somewhere to put treats on frequent urination places to associate food with places she shouldn't pee and have tried that as well. It works for a little while then she's right back to it, treats or no treats.

The drive would only be an hour and she's comfortable back home (she lived there for almost 5 years) but for thanksgiving, I'm not sure if the driving + only being home for a week would be too stressful for her. For winter break I'm definitely going to bring her back.

I'm either going to have a friend look after her over thanksgiving and bring her back for winter break, or I'll bring her back for thanksgiving and keep her back home until after winter break. Any other college students facing this dilemma? I love having my cat here but it's stressful trying to plan through all the breaks, especially since they're pretty long and my cat tends to take a while to acclimate to things.",CamRa201,2022-11-19,02:17:43,2022,11,19,2,17,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,Please help! My cat is obsessed with me.,"My cat is obsessed with me

I need help! 
Okay so I am a senior in college and I do in and out of depressive states a lot.. medication isn’t my favorite thing ever and my therapist and my doctor recommended I get an emotional support animal. I’ve already wanted a cat anyways, so I went ahead and looked for a cat! I knew I wanted an older cat because kittens are just too much. But I met a cat named Telly, a 1.5 year old half Persian half whatever neighborhood cat. I met him and his owner and then we set up an arrangement for me to adopt him! A week went by and I picked him up and brought him to my place (I live in a dorm but it’s a studio apartment dorm… kinda big). He was obviously scared at first but within one day he was out and about and demanding pets. He’s picky, only eats turkey flavored food. So he didn’t eat at first because I mistakenly gotten chicken lol. Anyways, it’s been a week. He weaves in and out of my feet whenever I walk.. so I’m constantly tripping over him. If I don’t play with him for like 2 hours.. he isn’t tired and keeps me up all night meowing. And not just meowing, howling. And he stops if I pet him. Whenever I walk to the kitchen he runs after me and gets in my way when I’m trying to get his food, or make my own food… he just wants to be pet! I can’t sit at my desk because he repeatedly jumps onto my lap. If he’s not being pet, he stares at me. Like STARES AT ME. I like to take bubble baths, they are very relaxing. I can’t do that anymore because when I do he scratches at the door, and if I let him in he just stares at me and meows very loudly. Basically howling. I’m trying to ignore it, because if I get mad he doesn’t care because he likes any attention. He literally purrs if I get raise my voice. So yeah I’m trying to ignore him but it’s so hard. What do I do?!",Mediocre-Lettuce5846,2022-11-19,01:17:56,2022,11,19,1,17,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,cat no longer enjoys being held,"Hi all!! I have had my cat since she was 1, she is 13 now. I'm not sure if this is just her personality changing over time or something else, but around the age of 10 she stopped wanting to be held. She used to beg to be picked up, she loved rubbing her cheeks against my ears for some reason lol. She is not aggressive or irritated when I do need to pick her up, she has no issue letting me get her down from high places or pick her up and put her in the carrier etc, but she definitely doesn't want to snuggle up in my arms like she used to.

It's not a huge deal, as she still maintains a strict pet tax collection schedule every day, I'm mostly curious and maybe just a lil sad that my baby doesn't snuggle my ears anymore 😭",308590033,2022-11-18,22:54:17,2022,11,18,22,54,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Giving cats away,"My partner and I moved to a new country last year. We're only in the third year of our marriage and we were very optimistic about settling down here. So we got one trauma baby and a few months later, another beautiful boy so that she can be happier. It worked out really well until our financial situation got worse because I'm not getting jobs here (racism is prevalant) and my partner's company is not paying us enough or covering some expenses they said they would.


Cherry on top, I caught my partner sexting someone and my life fell apart. I ran back to my country, set up my cats to be more independent (trained them with feeders and whatnot) and ensured that they were well taken care of by my partner. He did a wonderful job with them and they're more happy and healthy brats. I came back to figure out the next steps for us and my future in general. Also, came back because I have no money left. But I'm not coping well here. I wasn't coping well with the move to begin with but now I'm very suicidal and I'm battling severw depression.

I cannot imagine a life without my cats but we are planning to pack up and head back because this whole experience has only depleted our resources and ruined our lives. I come from India and for some reason they have this funny rule about pet transportation.  It states that I have to be in a country for at least two years to be able to take my pets back with me. I don't think I have the mental stamina to do this. Plus, it costs a LOT to take them back. 

Is there a workaround or any suggestions for agencies who can help us? Also, people around me, including my therapist, are suggesting that we give them away because we have so much to deal with already.

I feel shittier when I think about this and really my pets have been my only friends here. Seeking advice from reddit.",Toph28,2022-11-18,22:46:34,2022,11,18,22,46,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Harness training/walking outside an adult cat,"Hello!
Me and my partner adopted a cat from the shelter about a month ago. She was found on the streets back in August and came to the shelter with a broken leg (which is now healed) and seems to have been a house cat but noone came to claim her. She's two years old and looks to be a British Shorthair (she's not a fan of being picked up for long) and she seems to be used to us and comfortable with us.
Now she's quite active (I do try to play with her daily) and she loves birdwatching from the window, so I think she'd love the outside. We have a harness that she seems mostly okay with, we've put it on her  many times to get her accustomed to it. I know you're supposed to go slow and step by step. We live in a small apartment building, on the first floor and it has a tall fenced in yard, which is where I'd like to take her, going outside would mean going through the hall and down one set of stairs.
So far we've tried to go outside twice, once she wriggled out of the harness while we were putting on shoes by the door. I've adjusted the harness since then. The second time we got her to the door and to go a step into the hall by using a laser pointer and treats but she retreated back into the apartment.
So far Ive been thinking to get her used to going into the hall and exploring there and then moving outside when she gets more comfortable, but maybe I should put her in her carrier and go outside and let her come out and explore then (on a leash ofc)? Just because going into the hall first might take very long and she doesn't know that after that she'll get to go outside. Any advice how to go about it or tips from your experience?
I'm just very anxious to get her outside because I think she'd really enjoy it and it'd be good for her, since our apartment is quite small.",Spaceyss,2022-11-18,21:28:25,2022,11,18,21,28,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Upcoming house move,"I was wondering if anyone has any tips or tricks that have worked from personal expertise or any general advice for an upcoming house move. 

Background: we have two indoor cats which are sisters and are just over 2 years old, the new house is about 40-50 minutes drive away. 

So far we have already started to use a calming diffuser in our current property and have one ready to put in the new house to hopefully help calm and also we’re trying to keep smells more familiar. We have put their cat carriers in their room so they get used to it. When we move they’ll go into one room in the new house and be kept there until they acclimatise (with all of their toys and things they recognise). We plan to move in a way which hopefully provides as little disruption as possible (we’ll be moving them and their things last and hopefully get everything out of the rest of the house first). 


Anything else we could do/anything we’ve missed? And does anyone have any ideas about if we are best making the 1 hour trip with them in the 1 larger carrier together or separating them into two carriers so they have their own space?",Cyclingnightmare,2022-11-18,18:29:16,2022,11,18,18,29,Friday
1,CatAdvice,Help! My cat is peeing on my bed and sofa.. don’t know what to do :(,"My cat is constantly peeing on my bed and sofa and I’m starting to feel so hopeless.
A little bit of backstory:
My grandmother found her just a few months old outside and took her in. Since she could not keep her at that time, I took her in. At around 8-9 months, she started peeing on my bed and sofa and I figured that it’s due to hormones and got her spayed. The peeing stopped!
Fast forward, this summer I brought her to my grandmother’s place, since she was living in the countryside and I thought that she would like to run around outside instead of always being in my flat. She spent there 2 months and then my grandmother had to move, so I took her back. I was temporarily staying at my boyfriends place, which was a very small studio. She started to constantly pee everywhere. I thought maybe it was due to a medical issue and took her to the vet, but that was not it. Then I realised that maybe she just does not like the new space since it was so small. So I asked my grandmother to look after her for a bit until I get my place back. By that time, my grandmother had already moved to another place and is living in a flat, so my cat did not spend any time outside when she was with her. She did not pee once, until after a month, when my mom came for the weekend and she peed on my mom’s bed. My mom then brought her back to me since I moved back to my place. And ever since then (about a month) she’s peeing either on my sofa or my bed. She has 3 litter boxes, I clean them everyday. The are all located in private areas, easily accesible though. I thought, maybe she is jealous of my boyfriend (although they always play together, he feeds her sometimes and seem to be vibing well), so asked him to stay at his place for a week and see if that might be the issue. For a few days it was fine, but then the peeing started again. I read that someone had the same issue, so started feeding the cat on the sofa, since cat’s don’t do their business where they eat, however, today while I was on the sofa, she peed on me. The thing is, she is so playful and friendly and does not look anxious or stressing, but of course, I can’t know for sure how she’s feeling. I just don’t know what else to do..",DetectiveRealistic73,2022-11-18,18:13:13,2022,11,18,18,13,Friday
1,CatAdvice,Cat has cravings for all types of food,"My gf rescued a baby stray kitten from the street when he was about 1 month old. We took them to the vet, and checked for everything, and all indicated that he is perfectly ok, health wise.

He is now around 5-6 months old, and has been castrated in the meanwhile. He was always very **very** needy, mewoing **a lot** (like - a lot) and asking for attention - which I can't really understand, because we really give him a lot of attention, play with him a lot, and has lots of toys he plays with. 

For the last couple months, he just decided that he would eat everything at sight. All our food (one time he peeled a boiled egg to reach the yolk) isn't safe, and we can't be distracted for 30 seconds, that he'll be having a go at it. He is also incredibly stubborn - we push him away from the food, take him off the table, and he'll repeat it over and over again, instantly, like nothing ever happened. If we leave him alone for a few hours, he'll even try to raid the garbage can! Even as I writing this, he was trying to go for my cereals. Yesterday, we were distracted for 5 minutes, and then noticed we was eating a pepperoni pizza - of course, later on, he would be puking. 

I really don't know what else to do. It can be extremely tiring, and it demands constant attention.

Could it be something wrong with him? Something with his food? Just his personality? What can we do?

1,CatAdvice,Cat’s behavior drastically changed in past 6 months,"I have owned cats my entire life and normally don’t post stuff like this. But this is a desperate cry for help at this point. My husband and I rescued a cat after a friend of his found him abandoned in a condo.  We planned to get his medical stuff out of the way before introducing my husbands two cats. They had met through the basement door and were curious about each other. The vet figured he was just around a year old and we got all his shots and neutering out of the way. After his recovery we started slowly introducing the other two face to face and was able to move them into the basement with us. Our most recent addition had discovered climbing on bookshelves, knocking everything off tables and any surface he could. I spend plenty of time playing with them and they have a fairly large box of toys so I didn’t think much of the behavior as it’s a cat.  However the past two or three months it’s been unbearable to live with… Nothing is safe. He won’t come near me, destruction is at an all time high, knocking picture frames he can reach off the wall, scratching the walls all the time despite the cat tree, biting me, my husband, and any guests who are over on the ankles followed by my frantic apologies as he truly “didn’t use to act this way”  My husband and I are firm believers of never giving up on an animal and even we are wondering if we’ve done something wrong and if this cat is even happy here.

1,CatAdvice,Struggling to give my cat pills. Absolute nightmare.,"I’ve tried several ways from videos on YouTube and nothing seems to work. The pills have to be broken in half and are bitter and as soon as they go in his mouth, they start to dissolve, and he immediately starts to salivate and drool everywhere and spits the pill out. He Scratches us. The pill is for chest congestion and inflammation so squeezing him in a burrito doesn’t work only makes it worse. His throat is being pressed on by something growing inside of him so he cannot eat dry food anymore, only wet food. 

Why did the vet give us pills that need to be split making them sharp? Even I would have trouble swallowing that without water. 

The two time we got him to take the pill it worked amazing and he was able to rest and act like a normal cat.


Also need a good recommendation for a quality wet food for him to gain weight.",TaylorSwift427,2022-11-18,10:06:48,2022,11,18,10,6,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Meowing and hot ears?,"Looking for advice as whenever my cat’s behaviour is even slightly out of character, I go into panic, worst case scenario mode. 

My cat is 6 years old and isn’t the most cuddly, but can be when it’s on her terms. She is always waking me up to let me know it’s time for breakfast, and she’s always sitting in the kitchen sink for flowing water (despite her clean, fresh bowl of water - typical kitty). She is only chatty when she wants water or food, and occasionally tells me about her day when she comes to snuggle before bed. 

Today and yesterday she hasn’t been herself. She has been hiding under a chair in the office. She isn’t waking me up for breakfast, but still runs over when she hears me fill it but she barely touches it. She has not been in the sink. She has been walking around my apartment non-stop and has been meowing more than I’ve ever heard her. Also, her ears are very hot (which in itself isn’t super concerning but mixed with the other behaviours it raised some concern). Her tummy and armpits are not noticeably warmer than usual. 

My apartment building has been testing the fire alarms for the last three days, and I am hoping that this has just stressed her out. 

She has food, water, toys, lots of comfy places to snooze. Should I be concerned? Or give a few more days to see if she calms down?",ggriffiths13,2022-11-18,09:27:03,2022,11,18,9,27,Friday
1,CatAdvice,"8 month kitten stealing and eating tissue, growling when we try confiscate",Hi everyone. Our 8 month old has always had a naughty streak. We put everything away where he can't reach because he will break his way into anything and will try eat anything that fits in his mouth..including tissues. Today I had to take some out to blow my nose and as soon as I put it down on the table he jumped up and stole it! Then made a run for it. Once he gets tissues or his favourite ball in his mouth he tends to growl and not let go. For tissues we usually just waft a scent he hates around his nose so he drops it. This time he just withstood it and would not let go. He even had his claws out and almost scratched me while I was waving the smell around his nose. And he hissed as well! He never hisses usually. I had to get the oven mitts out to get it out of his mouth because he can eat a whole sheet of tissue. Any advice on how to correct this behaviour? For context we do have another kitten who is younger by 3 months who is more timid and docile. Thanks!,Ohana18,2022-11-18,09:26:17,2022,11,18,9,26,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Help managing single kitten syndrome in my young adult cat?,"I had heard of single kitten syndrome when I adopted my (at the time) 2 month old kitten from a local shelter. I asked the people working if she was old enough to be adopted alone, asked if I should be concerned about single kitten syndrome, and they assured me that it was totally fine as long as I played with her a lot.

Welllll fast forward a year later and I’ve got a fully grown best buddy with a LOT of attitude. At times, she’s very sweet and loves to cuddle and always welcomes me home with a “?” shaped tail and rubbing her head on my legs. She’s also very funny to play with if she has the right toys.

The problem is I can’t keep up with her. She either destroys her favorite toys (realistic looking bird/rat/bee/moth string toys) within days, or she get’s bored of solo play toys too quickly—even when I hide them for part of the day to try to retain novelty. I feel guilty for getting frustrated when I can’t keep her entertained, and she lashes out at me. Her biting has been getting a lot worse (doesn’t draw blood or anything, but these are definitely not love bites). She’s not interested in being diverted to a toy, so sometimes I resort to giving her a (gentle!) defensive bop and walking away, or blow on her face, neither of which feel super effective either but I don’t know what else to do when she’s hurting me. She also swats and sneak attacks at the guy I’ve been dating, and I can tell it’s really starting to bug him that she’s not warming up with time, even after giving her new toys and treats every time he comes over.

I recently started working a lot more and am now gone at least 6 hours a day, occasionally overnight, and rarely for a couple of days at a time. I got her a cat tree as an attempt to “enrich her environment” but cannot afford to buy her new toys every single week. Any ideas how I can keep her happy affordably and sustainably? I live alone in a small studio apartment, and at this point she’s not well socialized so I don’t think adopting a buddy for her is a viable option.",bastard_unicorn,2022-11-18,06:47:43,2022,11,18,6,47,Friday

for more context: my cat easily gets along with other cats, as i already had another cat (2 years) when i brought him home. the two times my cat has been around dogs was once carrying him to the basement at my moms house (who i was staying with for a couple days) in his crate. he didn’t even interact with my moms dogs, just smelt them and was hissing. the other time my friend came over with her dog and just let him run around my apartment without asking or telling me first. my cat got all puffy and freaked out. tried to attack the dog.",Wonderful_Jaguar_978,2022-11-18,04:51:50,2022,11,18,4,51,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Need help convincing to get a cat,"Hello, I have a moral dilemma that I don't know if I am overthinking about. I have loved cats ever since I was a child and never got a chance to own one. Now as an adult, I have that opportunity. 

The only thing that keeps me away from getting a cat is the idea of owning an animal and not giving it a family. I want to raise a cat, give it a mate, let them have their litter and be together. Thinking of neutering an animal or having to separate a mother from its litter leaves me feeling troubled.

I know this is unrealistic and a lot of space and money is required for this dream. But the idea of keeping an animal to myself and cutting of that future which I feel is a natural part of life keeps me away from getting one. Having a pet and just it being there for my own comfort and pleasure doesn't sit right with me.

I want to know if this is an overreaction. Am I thinking too deeply? Do cats maybe not feel this sense of connection? I would appreciate if I could get some options from cat owners.",Accomplished_Ball779,2022-11-18,04:09:21,2022,11,18,4,9,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Would it be a bad idea to try and socialize my cat?,"A little background before I get into my question: I (18m) have had my cat Zuzu (7-8 y/o) since she was around 1 year old. My family and I adopted her from a local shelter as a Christmas present for me in 2016, and we really don't know anything about her past. She was kind of getting bullied by this fat tabby, which is one of the reasons I chose to adopt her. She can be a bit temperamental, but she's an amazing addition to our family.

Now, getting into my question. I've been wanting to get another cat for a while, as I'm a cat person, and since the passing of my dog a few years ago I've missed having several pets in the house. My cat, however, I don't think would be very thrilled at the idea. She's had some issues with both cats and dogs in the past- she'll hiss at neighborhood cats she can see from the window, and if my sister or family friends ever bring their dog over she'll smack and hiss at them. The dog I had mentioned before was a teenage chocolate lab that we had before we brought Zuzu home. Although she was wary and a bit aggressive at first, she did warm up to him a lot, and they became good friends (never any aggressive behavior, cuddling together, etc). He was a big pushover, and never barked, snapped, or even paid any attention to her when she would hiss at or smack him. This probably played a role in how well she liked him, as any dog with especially high energy or interest in her she absolutely despised. I should also mention that about a year ago, she had gotten a stressed induced UTI after we babysat a friend's dog for two weeks, and we have since refused to have any dog over for more than a few hours.

So what I'm getting at is, would it be a bad idea to see if she would open up to another animal in the house? I know she has the capacity to be chill with other animals, as she was with my lab, but I also worry about causing her any sort of significant stress and getting another UTI. I thought maybe if the cat had a very chill temperament like my past dog that it would be easier, but I just don't know. My desire for another cat aside, I also ask because my mom's boyfriend may be moving in with us soon, and he would likely bring his 14-year-old dog. The two have had a few interactions, and my cat wasn't as aggressive or defensive as she has been with other dogs, but I'm still concerned about it. Any advice or anecdotes would be greatly appreciated.",mothmansforest,2022-11-18,02:59:40,2022,11,18,2,59,Friday
1,CatAdvice,Take my cat with me abroad?,"Earlier this year (feb) my friend asked me to take in her cat for 2 weeks. However, she never picked her up her cat, and when I asked her about it, she told me she cannot keep her anymore and will have to drop her off to the shelter. Long story short I decided to keep her as I’ve grown to love her and couldn’t imagine sending her to a shelter when she could have a loving home with me. 

Now the issues is I’ve had some health issues come up and will have to move move from Canada to Jordan for at least the next 4 months. I want to take the cat with me. It’s a really long flight - about 15-18 hours. Is it okay to put the cat through that? She is used to us being alone at home but when I go back to Jordan there will be more people at home and I am worried about how she will adapt to the new setting. Also, the house is much bigger than my current apartment. 

I just can’t imagine leaving her whole i go away for several months. No one i know can take her in. And my only option is to send her to a shelter which I will absolutely not do. Am I making the right decision to take her with me although I know she might face some difficulties while adjusting to a new home and a long flight?

1,CatAdvice,Help with picky cat,"My cat had a really rocky start to life. We found out she had trichomoniasis after months of vomiting, loose stools, and initial diagnosis of failure to thrive. She initially was obsessed with wet food but was prescribed Hills prescription biome food. Well we could not find the canned food anywhere due to the pandemic shortage so we switched her to the kibble version as that was the only food she tolerated. After putting her on rinadazole, we were able to wean off the prescription food. Since then, wet food has been very rocky and she is extremely picky. One day she will eat it, another day she absolutely refuses to touch it. We eventually caved and got her Tiki carnivore kibble which she absolutely loves, however, it made her litter box smell horrendous the minute she goes in it. We ended up eventually switching to fresh pet Vital cat food and she loved it at first for about a year and the litter box issue disappeared. Now she’s refusing to eat it and will only eat the kibble. We tried introducing wet food again and she wasn’t into it. She’s a very happy cat and loves her freeze dried chicken treats and will eat the kibble so it’s not like she’s refusing to eat all together. I’m just not sure if we should give up on the wet food and the fresh pet all together? Is there a kibble that doesn’t make the litter box smell like death?

1,CatAdvice,Should I let my cat back outside?,"I'll try to be as succinct as possible. My 15 yo cat is recovering from a nasty URI that I suspect she got from one of the cats that frequents our yard. She was my landlord's cat that they left at the house when they moved to be cared for by tenants (weird I know). She needed some expensive medical care for her URI that I ended up paying for, resulting in my landlords handing over ownership.

The issue is that she is indoor/outdoor and has been for her entire life. I would personally prefer to have my cats remain indoors, and if she was indoor only she likely would not have contracted a URI. She doesn't stray from the yard so my concern is the cats that come in from other houses. She has started begging to go back out and I just feel so bad, because I know she loves to bask in the sun and watch the neighborhood through the fence. I do play with her when she's around and would be willing to do that more to keep her entertained indoors...

The other issue is I have 3 roommates and I anticipate her getting out again just by their lack of observation or care. One of them often has a dog visitor that goes in and out so I would need to ask that the sliding door remains closed at all times. I'm considering just blocking any entry/exit points in the yard that I can find to prevent other cats coming around, but I would be risking another expensive health scare.

Thoughts? Is it cruel to make her stay indoors when she's had outdoor freedom for 15 years? Has anyone experienced something similar? Thanks!",ku1per,2022-11-18,01:45:09,2022,11,18,1,45,Friday

My question is whether there’s a book like On the Other End of the Leash but for cats. I can tell broad things like when they want to play, are relaxed, want me to leave them alone. But there’s a lot of behavior that I don’t understand because I just don’t know cats. Like who knew there are affectionate eaters?! I have to sit with one of them or he won’t eat much at all.

1,CatAdvice,I'm a new cat dad and I am overwhelmed/feel guilty for adopting.,"Pretty much the title, but me and my boyfriend adopted a cat about a month ago.

He's really really good with cats and has had cats before, but this is my first run having a cat.  

The cat is a wonderful cat.  She's a little over a year old and very friendly, although she is pretty timid and still adjusting to her new home.

At first, I was really excited!  But over the past week or so, I've been feeling this overwhelming guilt that I am just not doing enough for her and I can't shake it.  It's making me regret adopting a cat and its making it really hard for me to bond with her.

I did read that new cat/dog parents can go through "" kitten blues"" or ""puppy blues"", but I don't really know if thats whats going on or if I am just not cut out to be a cat dad.

Thankfully, my boyfriend isnt going through this and has been beyond helpful in taking care of the cat and playing with her so she's not neglected.

I really have no intentions of surrendering the cat because of my feelings, especially seeing how happy she makes my boyfriend.

I guess I'm just wondering if these feelings will pass?  I hate thinking that I'm wasting time feeling guilty when I could be trying to bond with her...

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  I want to be a good cat dad, but I don't have the slightest idea what to do or how to do it.",Wheres-my-cucumbers,2022-11-17,21:30:30,2022,11,17,21,30,Thursday
1,CatAdvice,How to get my cat to stop scratching my bed for food,"Hi,

My cat is two years old. He’s always been somewhat troublesome, but he was abused and rescued, what can I expect?  Every single morning between 5-7am, he will begin trying to wake me up for food. His way of doing this? Scratching the base of my bed. I just bought a brand new bed and base this past year and it already looks like it’s been around for years. He doesn’t stop no matter what I do. I’ve read so many posts on what to do in this situation. “Ignoring the behavior” doesn’t help, as he just continues to do it in different spots to get my attention. I’ve tried redirecting him to where he can scratch, giving him treats when he scratches his post or mat. It is to the point where it is driving me insane. Waking up before my alarm, listening to him destroy my bed is beyond infuriating. Not to mention, he only does it to me, on my side of the bed. Completely leaving my wife’s side alone. Any help or suggestions will be appreciated 🙏🏼",mikaladon1,2022-11-17,20:57:33,2022,11,17,20,57,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,My indoor cat’s behaviour and personality has changed after an adventure outdoors,"Hi team! A bit of background on our cat: she is a two year old rescue cat who was found hiding inside an industrial ac unit with her four kittens. She has been with us for about 8-9 months. She is normally a super sweet and affectionate gal but is not a fan of being picked up but loves a cuddle on her terms.

Anyways back to the current situation: 

Our lil gal escaped from the house recently after our door to our backyard wasn’t closed properly (we moved into a new place 4 weeks ago and we’re still getting used to the funky latches - totally my fault 😭) she proceeded to spend the day harassing and beating up every other cat on our street. There’s one really sweet kitty who has been coming into our yard and peeking through the glass door checking our cat out. And our cat totally beat this poor thing up under the floor boards of our house making some awful sounds but we couldn’t get to her to break up the fight.

She proceeded to keep running away from us and harassing other cats on our street until we finally were able to catch her and bring her home. She didn’t have a single scratch on her either which was very lucky- I hope the other cats are okay too. As she is normally the sweetest thing I felt like one of those parents getting brought into the school and being told that our sweet precious child is actually the BULLY. 

It’s been a couple of days and she has been pretty shitty with us. She still wants to be near us and be given affection but she is also much quicker to get angry and will bite and hiss which she would normally never do. Maybe I’m projecting but she just looks furious at us all the time. 

Is she just pissy that she had a taste of freedom and we took it from her furry little grasp? Is she just going through a comedown from being so overstimulated? Or is she feeling the guilt of bullying every other sweet cat on our street and just taking it out on us?

It’s pretty early days since her grand adventure terrorising our neighbourhood so she probably just needs some time to chill out. But just curious if anyone knows why exactly she’s become so moody or if there’s anything I should be doing to make her feel relaxed and comfy again?

1,CatAdvice,Introducing a mean cat to a shy cat,"Hi everyone, my boyfriend just moved in with me yesterday. He brought his 8 year old female cat and we’re currently isolating her in a bedroom. She’s gotten used to me; but she’s very territorial and aggressive to strangers. She’s never been around any cats before. (Besides her litter mates of course).

I have a very sweet one year old neutered male. He fell in love with me but he’s still very skittish around anyone but me. His old owner said he’s used to being around other cats, though. 

I’ve read up on how to introduce cats and I’m going to try and follow that, but I’m still very worried because they have complete opposite personalities. I don’t want the female to fight him right when they meet, and I’ll lose all the progress of trying to get my cat out of his shell.

While getting Dumpling's nails done at the vet is an option, it's not my favorite. Car rides really stress her out. I just really want it to be as unstressful of an experience as possible.

I adopted my cat a month ago, he's an 8yo very polite and mellow cat, doesn't seem to like climbing. however I thought he'd at least sit on the lower/floor parts of the tree, but he won't touch it with a 10 foot pole.

I'm thinking I didn't clean it properly, it probably still has lingering cat smell, so could use some deep cleaning advice. or, he could just be a cat who prefers his cardboard box, as cats do. I've put the tree next to my bed cause he likes sleeping in bed with me, I'm hoping that might entice him as well.

1,CatAdvice,"3 years, shelter cat still afraid of people.","My boy Morey has been living with me for over 3 years now. He was born and raised in a shelter and I am his first owner.i got him when he was already 4 so he's probably 7 now. 

I tried every trick to get him comfortable with people. The first few months he was under the bed all the time. I'd feed him and keep him in my bed room and would play with him and give him treats.  And besides being too skiddish to let me leave the bed he would be calm around me so I started letting him go out at night. 

He still wouldn't come out under the bed unless I was laying in it. That never changed. Over a year passed and covid hit so I moved my bedroom and made that room my office. I kept a bed and cat tree in there for him and let him get familiar with the room like before. Still working on giving him space and privacy. He was fine there but hid under the cat tree whenever I was in the room. Again if I was seated he would come out but only if I stayed seated. 

After a while in that room I kept the door ajar with a door jam so he could slip in and out as he wanted. But he eventually snuck back under my bed and now won't leave my bedroom. So I tried to accommodate him again. But since then he's been less social and even avoids being social with me. Won't come to me to pet him and hides if I call his name. 

I've tried just leaving him alone but it's been over a year now and nothing has changed. What can I do to get my cat back? Is he just never going to like people? It really breaks my heart that he acts like I'm a threat when all I do is talk in soft voices and offer treats. He will NOT let you pick him up and acts like his life is in danger if you do but he's never hissed when trying to pick him up (you have to corner him fyi) like when I take him to the vet but he does cry and yowl like you're killing him lol.  Vets say he's healthy so idk what else to do.  Any suggestions or questions I'm happy to discuss I just want to make sure he's happy..",HKJGN,2022-11-17,14:54:41,2022,11,17,14,54,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,My cat won’t use the litter box,"So we took my male cat to the vet and they gave me medicine to give him to see if it would help him urinate better. 
Basically he was yowling and licking himself a lot down below, so I took him to the vet. He would still pee in the litter box but we wanted to figure out why he peed on furniture and why he was acting that way.

The Vet gave me two medicines to give him, Gabapentin liquid medicine and Onsior (robenacoxib) pills. He took them for three days and he’s had a milliliter of the liquid medicine per day according to the Vets instructions.

The problem is he hasn’t peed in the litter box in two days. The Vet needs a urine sample so we put him in my sisters room with food and water so we could try to get it.

Instead he slept all day and didn’t use it, so we moved him into the bathroom with a cat bed to see if that would help. He pooped in the litter box but still hasn’t peed. If he doesn’t use it by tomorrow, we’re going to take him to the local vet hospital.

1,CatAdvice,Bored cat? Tips on getting a 2nd cat for 7mo(f),"Before I became a first time cat owner in July, I had rarely spent time around cats. I don’t have any friends or family that have cats, so I’m in unchartered territory here! Any advice you have would be so appreciated.

Rescued my girl from cat rescue (essentially just a room of 50+ cats!) when she was 3mo; now she is 7mo. Toileting and eating routines were healthy and normal from the moment she came home. We could tell early on she was chatty, chirping and trilling when she played with toys. But over the last few months, vocalization has increased excessively—especially at night.

She’ll spend a portion of the night playing independently (lots of chatter there) and looking out the window. But from 3-7am, she’ll start of cycle of going through all the rooms and bedrooms with her toys, trying to get humans to play with her. We used to keep the bedroom doors open, but she’d wake us up bringing her toys into the bed and walking on us. She won’t lay or rest in bed, she just seems to want to play. Now, we keep the bedroom doors closed, but she’ll cry in the doorway until we let her in. No amount of play time before my bedtime (around 10p) pacifies her til morning. All other behaviors are normal, she doesn’t act up, she doesn’t seem unhappy. She just seems… bored.

Which leads me to wonder: does she need a buddy? Would you recommend male or female? Her age or older? What steps can I take to ensure their personalities are compatible? I’m so nervous to bring another cat into the mix, and make everyone’s lives worse. Please help!",TheLadyG-23,2022-11-17,13:44:11,2022,11,17,13,44,Thursday
1,CatAdvice,sudden aggression,"so, long story. 
my male cat, 10 years, recently had a urinary blockage. he spent some time in hospital and came home and has been on gabapentin and a couple other meds since then. when he came home i kept him isolated from my other 3 cats, so i knew when he was using the litterbox and to keep an eye on him. after he got back on his feet i let him go back out in the rest of the house with the others. around this time he became territorial of one of the litterboxes and would attack or corner one of the other cats if they tried using it. then he started stalking them when they were just minding their own business. then he started doing it with the other two cats as well. he has had a history of sexual aggression but never anything like this. it's to the point i have to keep them apart because they can't go 5 minutes without fighting. 
i had originally thought the problem was the feliway diffusers i was using, because his aggression started up when i plugged them in,  but they're gone now and he's still being crazy.

1,CatAdvice,Saw my cat taste her new litter,"Cat - Jak, female, spayed, approx 2 yrs 3 months old. 

So I am in the process of switching my cats litter, I have her regular box set up with 75% old litter and 25% new litter. I have a second box set up with just the new litter in a different spot about 2’ away. (This was my mistake I poured the new litter out first and then forgot I needed to mix my old litter and needed to go buy more, so it’s just two litter boxes for now).

My plan WAS to clean her litter box on this weekend and do it 50-50 but I just need a reality check. 

I had JUST cleaned her litter boxes maybe 15 min before and saw her sniffing around her the box with only the new litter. But she seemed to be tasting it!? I stopped her twice before she left it alone. She did the cat chewing jaw so I think she tasted it, but I couldn’t see from my angle. 

Her old litter is Arm&amp;Hammer Scoop and I am switching to Worlds Best. 

I know Worlds best is corn based but obviously I don’t want her to eat it, and i know eating litter can be a sign of stress or health problems. 

I am now all sorts of worried I am stressing my cat out because I am giving her new wet food (dry food is same) and realize I may have made too many changes and she’s stressed and I feel like such an awful pet parent! 

I am switching her litter because I think her and I have sensitivity to the fragrance, and I wanted to try a lighter weight formula.",chiquitabrilliant,2022-11-17,13:09:11,2022,11,17,13,9,Thursday
1,CatAdvice,Some questions about my recently spayed 4 month kitten,"My kitten was spayed 5 days ago and i am in newish territory. I've had a cat spayed before at a much older age but it was so long ago I honestly don't remember much of the aftercare. So my first question is the 10 to 14 days that seems to be the most common recommendation for the recovery period. It's frustrating because i don't know that means is 10 days okay or do i need to wait the entire 14 days it makes no sense to me. I don't have a primary vet at the moment so it's not something i can ask them. As for my second question after these 10 to 14 days can my kitten resume normal activity. One thing that concerns me is that i have another cat that is about 6 months old and they love to play and sometimes that can be somewhat aggressive with each other. Is there risk of injury past that grace period? lastly would it be considered safe to leave her alone after the 14 days?. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance to those who can offer some.",johnsmithx0,2022-11-17,12:41:44,2022,11,17,12,41,Thursday
1,CatAdvice,advice for traveling,"hi all! just looking for any general tips for traveling for the holiday season with a new cat. he is ~2 years old and a loving kitty with no behavioral issues so far. 

for thanksgiving he will stay with my cat knowledgeable friends he has already met for the week (they have a female cat but plan to keep them separated). when i adopted him he only was shy/hid for the first day so i imagine it will be similar, but any advice appreciated!

for xmas, i want to take him home with me (5 hour drive), and i’ve got two small dogs at home. i plan to just keep him in my room but he does love to explore. there’s so much advice about introducing cats and dogs who will live together but what about when it’s only for a week or two?
and then the family will be traveling for a few days during this break (the 2 dogs will be boarded) so he is going to be at the house with family watching him, so it’s just going to be a LOT for him!

i know as long as i am there he will be okay but i don’t want him to be too stressed out with all of this going on close together!! any car, new place/people/animal intro advice welcomed, thanks all!!!",Affectionate_Year444,2022-11-17,12:34:40,2022,11,17,12,34,Thursday
1,CatAdvice,Just got a kitten - I’m worried I need to get another?,"I got my little boy at 2months and we’ve had him for a month now, so he is 3months. He is adjusting great! He has a whole house to explore and plenty of toys/scratchers/mental stimulation.

I’ve been reading a lot on how many cats prefer to have another cat around as a companion and playmate. Since my kitten is still young, it would be a good time to introduce another, but he seemingly does well by himself when left alone for a few hours. 

He honestly just sleeps and seems to eat and drink water when we are gone. 

Am I overthinking this? Or should I really consider getting him a buddy? 

I work from home, but sometimes my bf and I take weekend trips (we haven’t obviously since the kitten is still young), but I’m thinking about the future and I want to set my kitty up for success.",k4swap,2022-11-17,12:27:17,2022,11,17,12,27,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,2year old vs kitten,"Hi everyone, 

Me and my boyfriend we have a 2year old cat that was found on the street but he was already quite used to humans. 
Yesterday a friend of ours called us to say he had a cat living inside his walls for the last 2 weeks and he finally manage to get him out. It's a baby cat no more than 2 months old. 
I couldn't in good consicous leave the kitten outside in the street with the cold temperatures, wind and rain that we've been having. So we took the stray cat in tonight. 
He's terrified and dehydrated. I'm taking him/her to the vet tomorrow to do a full check up. 

Now my question, how do I get a stray kitten used to humans and to another cat? How do j get my other cat used to the kitten? I wanna do this properly to have a chance of keeping the kitten (if last case scenario they really sont get along I already have a friend that will take the kitten in). 

I've currently closed the kitten in a division with water, food, bed, litter, and I'm giving him space but my older cat is curious and goes to put his paw under the door to check on the kitten.

Also, my cat his a scared cat, afraid of his own shadow. 

Thank you for all the advices",Mnemosine778,2022-11-17,12:03:29,2022,11,17,12,3,Thursday
1,CatAdvice,"How do I ""wear out"" my cat?","My cat, 2yo tortie, has more energy than both my husband and I combined. We both play with her but she has gotten bored with the toys we have already. The red dot of doom is only fun for about 10 minutes, then she just lays down slightly defeated since she can't catch it. When she wants our attention she goes to knocking things off of surfaces - including houseplants, glass jars, anything that might get our attention quickly.

Toys we have:

* laser (red dot of doom)
* several balls (squishy golf balls, glow in the dark table tennis balls)
* 2 catnip fish tacos
* 1 catnip bird with feather tail (that I'm worried about giving to her because she chews on the feather tails and I don't know if it's ok for her to swallow)
* octopus crinkle toy
* several scratch pads
* feather on string at end of stick
* ball in plastic donut (the one that spins)

Looking for toy suggestions. We live in an apartment, so unfortunately another cat isn't an option.

1,CatAdvice,CBD Cat Treat Recommendations,"Hi there! My almost 15 year old cat has glaucoma. A side effect of the eye drops I give him for the glaucoma is burning eyes (which lines up with his reaction when I administer them—sorry buddy, burning eyes is probably better than no eyesight). I also suspect he’s developed some arthritis as his gait seems stiff when he walks and he doesn’t go upstairs much anymore to a favorite sunny spot. I’ve been wondering if a cat CBD treat may ease some of the pain he might be in. I would love any brand recommendations you have!

1,CatAdvice,Why is my cat acting weird?,"My bf and I adopted a stray male kitten a couple of months ago. He was 6 months at the time, now he's almost 9. When we first got him he played normally, but for the past month and a half he sometimes will growl after catching the toy and tries to go hide it (usually under the bed). He's even done this while we weren't playing w him - he'll sometimes see one of his stick toys and will grab it and start taking it to hide, but he'll pass the doorway into the bedroom, which has a hanging mouse toy, and try to grab that at the same time. He will then hold onto both toys and try to drag them under the bed, but since the hanging mouse toy is connected to the door, it will put up resistence and he'll growl at it.

He's also become much more destructive of his toys. We can't buy him plush toys anymore cause he'll absolutely decimate them within the first hour.

Is this something that can happen as he reaches puberty? We haven't neutered him yet, though we plan to at the end of the month. He hasn't been spraying at all so we're a bit confused. Does anyone have any tips?",SoakedSun,2022-11-17,11:23:04,2022,11,17,11,23,Thursday
1,CatAdvice,Do some cats never bond?,"I have a mother son cat duo, the mother was originally a pregnant stray and we adopted out all her kittens but one, they’re about 2 and 3 years old now both neutered. she’s a pretty timid squirreley cat, occasionally affectionate but usually very independent, the son is more social, loud and clingy. They’ve never been particularly aggressive toward one another besides some territorial growling over cardboard boxes, they don’t mind eating in the same room, they’re civil, but they’ve never bonded. They don’t groom each other, sleep, or play together, sometimes the son tries to initiate play but she starts growling and her body language implies she’s irritated so I separate them. I understand some cats just have conflicting personalities and will never be affectionate to one another, but since the aggression seems pretty situational and one sided on the mothers end I’m wondering if there’s something I can do to help them get along better, or at least help her feel less anxious and defensive about him. 
Some other random context;
-The growling and helicopter ears from mom only seems to happen when she is in my room with me, and the son enters
-she’s more defensive than aggressive, like she’s afraid of him but I have no idea why since in two years I’ve never seen him attack/bother her, he just seems confused by her reaction
-I give both of them catnip, I know it makes them behave strangely but not sure if aggression is a side affect
-she was neutered first, but we had to wait until he was about a year old to neuter the son because appointments were impossible during covid
Id appreciate any insight, regardless of their ability to bond neither of them will ever be abandoned by me, just putting that out there.",grapesouda,2022-11-17,11:18:17,2022,11,17,11,18,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,How many calories should a 7 month old indoor neutered male kitten (3.5kg) have?,"I have 2 kittens, both coming up to 7 months old, one male one female. Both neutered and indoor only. They've got some ragdoll blood in them, if that info is important.

The female is 3kg and male is 3.5, weighed this morning before breakfast.

The female kitten has shown me she can self regulate, very occasionally leave a bit of food. The male one will clean his bowl to the point it looks washed and then go on to clean hers. Also meows for food when he sees me getting their bowl. 

I'm currently feeding them 300 calories give or take. 3 main meals of wet food, 1-2 snacks of wet food pouches shared between them, and dry food as treats before bed (5-6 varying meals a day). When they split food I gave the male one a bit more. 

I have conflicting info... The pouches say ~3-3.5 pouches for their age, which is ~240-280 kcals. But other websites (untamed list of kcal for kitten weight, not age) say ~400 kcal for 3.5kg. 

So I've got one source saying less than 300kcal for their AGE, another saying 400 for their WEIGHT...

I unfortunately don't trust my vet on this. I was feeding them 3 pouches a day with dry food when they were 6 months old and vet said my male kitten is on the heavier end of healthy. I trusted him and reduced dry food but he meowed more and was lethargic. So I did more research and based on the ""what does his waist look like"" diagram he's either underweight or lower end of health (could feel his ribs and spine easily, his shoulder blade was very obvious). So I feel I did him injustice and slowly went up to 300 kcal. But I'm not sure where to go from here... Do I stay 300 or go up to 350 gradually to 400?

1,CatAdvice,My cat won't leave girlfriend's office after moving,"Hi all,

We just recently moved and my cat will not leave my girlfriend's office. We set it up as his home base, he's got a tree, a litter box, food and water. He's still eating and using the litter normally, and he's still playful and affectionate if you're in the room with him.

He doesn't seem to like the long hallway that connects to the room. I've tried putting another tree and a tunnel he loves in the hallway to give him some places to hide and make it smell familiar. Nothing seems to work. We've lived here since the 8th of October.

Any advice?

1,CatAdvice,Taking back sick cat to shelter,"I adopted my cat about 6 months ago from the shelter. When I got her, she was healthy and the shelter said she didn't have any health issues, besides a small cold which I was able to treat through some oral medicine. Since then though, I've had to take her to the vet multiple times for multiple different reasons. 

The most recent and severe vet visit was this week. Long story short, she was throwing up dozens of times (clear/foamy liquid). I've taken her to the vet 3 times this week. She was diagnosed with IBS/IBD/acute pancreatitis. She's currently at the vet as I am typing this, getting her iv fluids, medication, and steroids. 

I am currently struggling financially. I got in a car accident, have to find a new job due to being laid off, currently a college student, etc. 

I put away a few thousands of dollars incase my cat needed it for any emergencies or vet visits. But I've already spent it all within the past 6 months for her frequent vet visits. This week especially was a big dent as I got her an ultrasound, fluids, medication, shots, special food, all the vet fees, etc.

I don't know what to do. I am seriously thinking about surrendering her back to the shelter but I don't know. I live in Austin, Texas right now. I am feeling so guilty and stressed. My heart hurts thinking about surrendering her, especially with her condition at the moment...  What can I really do right now though?",No_Lake101,2022-11-17,04:41:35,2022,11,17,4,41,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,Introducing my cat and dog,"In about a month, my cat and I will be moving into my parents house (who has a dog) for a few months. I would like some advise on how to introduce them. I know to start off with keeping them in separate rooms so they can get each others scent before actually meeting. But after that, I am not sure how to safely have them in the same room. 

For some background on my dog: she gets along with other dogs, she had been to pet hotels and is always fine being in the room with the dogs, but I am not sure how she is with cats. I know she can be territorial because we have seen her get aggressive toward humans (like my dog is very protective of me. If I am laying with my dog and my mom comes toward us, the dog will growl at my mom) So I am not sure if she will bring this side of her out on the cat, and if so, how do I prevent it?

And some background on the cat: she had been around other cats, and loves them. She is young and very playful, but she has never been around a dog before. My cat has never shown any signs of aggression. 

The house that we will be in is quite small, it has two bedrooms with an open kitchen/living room area. There is also a screened in porch. (I mention this because I am wondering if it would be a good idea to have one pet outside and one pet inside so they can see each other without being able to harm each other. But again, my dog is territorial, so I am not sure if that would make it even worse) Also, I think my cat might be a little bigger than my dog (my dog is a small white dog and my cat is a big black cat) 

Any advise or stories from experience would be of great help!! I just want them to get along and I feel like if the first interaction is bad, it could set it up to be bad overall and I don't want to have to keep my cat in a single room the whole time I am there.",Quick-Writer-4757,2022-11-17,04:05:19,2022,11,17,4,5,Thursday
1,CatAdvice,Cat prefers dry food,"He used to eat the wet food we give him in the morning real quick, we get those variety packs from the store (I wish we could afford better but we’re a bit strapped for cash rn). But lately I’ve been cutting back on serving sizes in the morning because he just stopped eating it as much, and now today not at all. And he’s had days where he doesn’t eat it at all before.

We would him dry food in the evening, so he was getting two decent meals a day. But lately I’ve been giving in and getting his dry food down earlier because he just cries and begs for it, started getting into trouble for attention until he gets it.

I keep his water clean and topped off (when he’s not pulling it off his food tray to make an annoying mess lol) and he loves his ‘sippies’ from the bathroom sink. But I’m really worried he’s not going to get all the nutrients he needs if he will just stubbornly go hungry until he gets his dry food.

1,CatAdvice,Cat aggression towards friend,"So I have six cats in my household and aside from the initial interaction upon introducing them, there has been no serious aggression for two years.

Previously they were best friends play fighting occasionally and cuddling but now I can’t have them in the same room without her trying to start something with him. She’s fine with the other 5 but it’s just him, not scent or food based as she has no problem with anyone else eating out of her bowl or anything that smells like him so aside from taking her to the vet I’ve tried everything.

1,CatAdvice,tips for giving pills to my cat without any appetite,"Today my 2 yr old cat was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect. So now i have to give him a bunch of pills everyday.
But the problem is he has barely been eating in the past few days (why i had him checked in the first place).
The doctor said that he would probably start eating again once he feels a bit better but for that i have to make him take his medicine somehow.
He isn't into treats at all and i cannot find a way to make him take his pills for the life of me.
If anyone has a good idea for something that can hide a pill well and would be easy to eat for a sick cat, that would be great.
Thank you",taveren_ann,2022-11-16,23:44:33,2022,11,16,23,44,Wednesday
1,CatAdvice,Cat Likes Being Bathed,"Wondering if anyone else out there has a cat who is similar…

My partner and I have two brothers, born in our home in May 2020. They’re super sweet and well behaved. One is super fluffy and the other, the runt of the litter, has a short sleek coat. 

The runt has some personality quirks, and his most recent is kind of strange. He likes to hold “hands”, for one! He had always been better with water than his brother, licking the inside of the tub, and just general curiosity with the bath. 

Now, every time I take a shower, he sits next to the shower and meows. It started where I would pet him and he seemed to like the water, he would lick my hands and purrs like crazy. So I tried a warm washcloth. This cat LOVES this, he lets me wipe down almost his whole body, purrs like it’s the best thing ever, and then waits until I am done and even lets me towel dry him. 

I know this isn’t necessarily normal, but I just hope it isn’t bad for him or indicative of any health issues.",ballingfrfr,2022-11-16,23:43:50,2022,11,16,23,43,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,Restarting Cat Introductions with my cat and my roommate's cat but their cat is continually aggressive/hunter mode,"My cat (F, 3 yrs old) and I moved in with a roommate and their cat (F, 3yrs old) back in July 2022 and the introductions were rushed, causing my cat anxiety and his cat to be very aggressive. For example, I bought a baby gate between my cat's safe space (my office) and the rest of the apartment so that way when we moved onto the next step of them visually seeing each other (again but in a controlled environment) there would be a barrier. 

The problem is that my roommates cat keeps charging the gate whenever I try to get out, trying to push it open, scratching the gate, and swipes at my cat in the space under the door when it's closed. I told my roommate he needs to spend more time with his cat, to exhaust her or find ways to distract his cat so that way the door isn't the most interesting thing. He bought a toy that pops out treats but other than that hasn't done much. His cat continues to wait right outside the door for any chance to run up and attack my cat. 

My cat is ready to explore the rest of the apartment confidently but then get's immediately scared when attacked by my roommate's cat.

1,CatAdvice,How to deal with cat being not affectionate?,"Hi everyone!

I’m coming to the wonderful Reddit community today as I fear I’m going slightly insane and I could really do with some advice. Details below:

I grew up with cats, all of them with different personalities (as they tend to have) and I really missed having that fun feline companionship once I moved out almost 9 years ago. For years all I wanted was to have my own cat again and two months ago that dream finally became reality when my new landlord agreed that we (me and my partner of many years) could have one in our house. 

I immediately contacted our local shelter and told them that we would be more than happy to take on a more senior cat that might have been overlooked due to their age or looks before because none of that mattered very much to me, all I wanted was a little cuddle bug that would enjoy hanging out with me. Don’t get me wrong, cats are still cats and having grown up around them I am well aware that they don’t always want to be loved on and sometimes just wanna be left alone which, again, completely fine I just wanted a somewhat healthy, mostly affectionate little cat to call my own.

They were incredibly lovely and informed me that they had a great fit for us, an almost 10 year old little lady, that they told us whilst very shy at first, was also very affectionate. I was incredibly happy and a few days later we went to pick her up. Staff warned us that she wasn’t having a good day and was hiding in her igloo, but since we were warned that she was a timid cat ahead of time I didn’t let it bother me, I knew that she was just very scared. They told us that she came from a multi pet plus kids household where she hid for most of the day and would barely come out because she was very unsettled by all the goings on, hence why she was rehomed. We took her home that same day still.

She’s a very cute cat and after hiding for most of the day for the first few weeks she’s started to come out of her shell and will now sleep on the sofa or the bed instead of hiding somewhere in the house out of sight. She’s even super playful still and its very cute to watch.

Now my (would like to make it very clear that this is indeed a me problem, the cat is a cat and has obviously not done anything wrong) problem: 
She doesn’t like to be touched much or hang out with me. She will meow for attention in the mornings and evenings when she wants to be fed or wants someone to throw her toy around for her but won’t like it if you try and stroke her and evade. When trying to pet her when she’s sitting down she will gently swat at you or get up and leave so she clearly doesn’t enjoy it. She will also spend her time in a different room than me if she can and never really seeks company other than for meal times.

I’m really sad about it. The rational side of me knows that she’s just a cat and she doesn’t know any better but I just feel so heartbroken every time I look at her. I just want her to enjoy being with me, even if she never wants to be held or doted on loads I could live with that as long as she still at least enjoys being around me. But it doesn’t seem like she does, if anything she avoids me most of the time. I’ve tried being the one who feeds her, bonding over treats and playing. But she just doesn’t seem to have an much of an interest in interacting with me.

I feel like a horrible person because of how selfish I am being about this. I’ve been crying a lot because I feel like a terrible cat owner that can’t just accept that they have an independent cat and move on. My partner is getting frustrated with me being so upset about this as well and has told me that I need to stop being this emotional and that she’ll get around to liking me more eventually, but I feel like I’m getting nowhere. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? Has anyone experienced something similar before and if so how did you make yourself get over yourself? How do I stop being so sad about not having the cuddly loving pet I wanted?

Again I know im being ridiculous and acting like a sensitive child, I just don’t know how to stop so any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Note: I would never bring her back to the shelter regardless of my feelings. I made a commitment when I picked her that I would give her the best possible rest of her life I can and that commitment is unconditional.

tldr: Adopted cat described as affectionate, cat isn’t affectionate with me and I don’t know how to deal with it.",throwmeawaymeow2022,2022-11-16,22:32:43,2022,11,16,22,32,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,My cat won’t let me sleep and I’m losing my mind.,"Hi all!

I have two cats. One is nearly two years, one is 3 months. 

The two year old has always had a problem waking me up excessively early. Honestly it’s on &amp; off. Over the past few months though (even before we got the little one) it has been excruciatingly bad. 

I make sure to play with them both before bed. They also get a small treat before bed, and throughout the day they are played with (we literally walk them) by us and each other. They are also very well fed. 

However, right around 4-5 am (our wake up time is 7) the older one starts. Meowing loudly, scratching at my face to wake my up, walking on my body, jumping on and off the bed. Now she’s teaching the little one this habit as well. 

I thought she needed more play time so I play with her even later. Nope, doesn’t work. I had hoped having the little one around would keep her occupied/distracted, but not really. 

We live in a studio-style apartment so there’s not really “another room” I can put her in. 

I have tried feeding her dinner later and later but that doesn’t seem to have any effect. 

I have tried just waiting up for 2-3 hours or holding off on feeding them for as long as I can, but I’m exhausted. I have a hard job &amp; a long commute and I haven’t had one night of solid sleep in so long. 

I don’t feed them dry food &amp; I worry about the logistics of a wet automatic feeder. 

Does anyone have any experience here? I would really appreciate the help.",lawschoolwannabe123,2022-11-16,21:11:39,2022,11,16,21,11,Wednesday

The kitten is not even sleeping or chilling on this chair, maybe once or twice. I tried companying Mala to make her feel empowered, or to put hairs of her on the chair to make it smell more like her but nothing seems to help. This has been going on for like 6 weeks now.

1,CatAdvice,Can I take a 2.5 month old kitten on a train?,"
My parents have asked me to come stay with them this Christmas but I am a little worried about bringing my kitten on the train. 

She will have only had her 1st set of vaccinations at this point (due her booster on December 28th). The journey is 3 hours long and usually is a quiet journey. 

Also my parents have a cat but he is old and blind and does not go outside of there house (don’t think he’s been in contact with another cat for 2-4 years) and is also fully vaccinated. Their house is also big enough to keep the kitten and my parents cat completely separated if need be. 

Do you think this will be safe for the kitten as most advice I find says that as long as the kitten isn’t in contact with another unvaccinated cat it would be fine. 

I’m happy to stay in my own home this Christmas however my grandma is becoming quite unwell so I want to make the journey if I can. 

I do have a good carry case for the kitten and will be travelling with a friend also. 

Any advice would be appreciated!

Thanks and hope you all have a lovely day :)!!",emotionaladvertisem,2022-11-16,17:26:20,2022,11,16,17,26,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,"In a major dilemma about adopting a cat, need serious advice guys &lt;3","Some context, last year, I was cat-sitting for a friend, it was my first long time exposure to a cat. I absolutely fell in love with cats after that experience. Someone like me who gets drained of energy around people quickly, I would love to have a purry companion to go back to. I feel it like it would be great for my mental health too since I live alone.

TLDR: I know for a fact I will be a cat dad one day however my dilemma is whether I should get a cat now and perhaps later in life when I am much more stable and settled. 

My arguments AGAINST getting a cat now:
- I might be moving states or countries in the next year for better work opportunities, should I wait a few more years and settle down and then get a cat?
- I do not have my own car yet, I am worried that regular vet checkups might be a hassle without my own car, ofc I would not want to compromise on my cat’s health.

My arguments FOR getting a cat now:
- It would be awesome to have my own little goofball, I feel like it would be great for my mental health too, I often work remotely and it can get lonely at times.

Sorry for the long post but this is something that has been on my mind for a while now, I just wanted someone to reason with me on this and fellow cat mom/dads please feel free to drop advice on whether those challenges can be overlooked while adopting a cat.  
Please feel free to ask questions and share any similar experiences and what did you do?

1,CatAdvice,my cat’s tail is always down,"i have 2 cats who are only a couple months apart from one another. one is named jet (black cat) and the other is liam (tabby). they’re both a bit over 1 year old. 

jet was raised around different cats for a couple months, because i would always foster 1 additional kitten around his age. eventually, i stopped fostering for a bit and went back to it later (we were fostering liam and ended up adopting him).

initially, they didn’t like each other, but after slow introductions they have grown to be a bonded pair. they play together, groom one another, cuddle together, etc. 

liam is very affectionate. he follows me around, needs constant attention from me, won’t let me use the bathroom alone. yk, typical clingy cat stuff.

jet USED to be very affectionate, as a kitten. i know it’s typical for them to become less affectionate during adolescence and adulthood, but i think this is different. 

jet has grown to run away whenever he sees me step in his direction. his tail is always low- not between his legs, but low. it is either like “ / “ or it is slightly curled at the base of his tail, angled downward with a hook at the tip of his tail. he walks around the house with his tail in this position all the time. i would insert a picture but i rarely use reddit and don’t know how to do that lol. he isn’t scared to be in my vicinity, but he does not like me approaching him, even if i do so slowly. he sleeps on my bed occasionally, and lets me scratch his chin every once and a while. he rarely lays with his stomach exposed and loafs a LOT.

he generally doesn’t like being touched, but i am the one who typically has to chase him around cut his nails, give him eyedrops (he has issues with his left eye), and sometimes have to pull him out from under something to do so. and i obviously have to hold him which he doesn’t enjoy. 

he used to petting him and holding him, but he’s taken a complete 180 and i don’t know if i’ve traumatized him or what. he doesn’t mind playing with me today

i don’t mind if he turns out to be a less affectionate cat with age, but i wish he would stop running from me and such. i don’t know if i did something wrong or if maybe having another cat may be upsetting to him for some reason even though they get along really well?

anything would help, i just want him to feel safe at home :(",pixiepipit,2022-11-16,12:55:54,2022,11,16,12,55,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,Navigating a new home with a VERY anxious cat,"I’ve had a lovely 5-6 year old girl for about 2 years from the shelter and appears to have come from a bad, neglected home so she is the most anxious cat I’ve ever owned in a shy, timid, hiding way. 

Over 2 years, I’ve managed with getting her to show herself during the daytime now and she will cuddle with me sleeping at night. Huge accomplishments.

But, I moved out of my tiny apartment in with my boyfriend into a fairly large house. I’ve been keeping her in a spare bedroom for now, with everything she needs, until she feels more relaxed to explore the house. However I anticipate she will just freak out, and search for obscure places to hide which is what she does best.

I’m wondering how long it will take her to adjust, how long I should keep her confined to one room, and anything else I can do to get her to be less scared.

I got Prozac from the Vet but the first few times of administering were traumatizing for her in itself that I stopped.

1,CatAdvice,Nail clipping without treats,"I adopted my sweet girl about two months ago and she is a wonderful cat! However, she hates being picked up and I can’t hold her long enough to even cut one nail. 
I’ve been working on practicing the kitty burrito and touching her paws during playtime but she is still very hesitant. I try to reward her with praise but there isn’t much else I can give her. She has hyperthyroidism and is on a strict diet, so high value treats are totally out of the question. 
Any advice? She has scratching posts and doesn’t really damage my furniture but I know her nails will need to be cut so they don’t snag on things.",p1231w,2022-11-16,10:40:11,2022,11,16,10,40,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,Having 2 litter boxes for our newly adopted cat (F4Years),"We live in a small town home that’s 2 stories. We have slowly progressed to moving her litter box downstairs which she is now using. She is shy and will only come downstairs when no other company is around. We would really prefer her use this litter box 99% of the time and it’s not a problem currently. We would like to have a spare litter box upstairs for when we have company over for her to use it and not have to come downstairs. How can we promote this behavior and make sure she does not use 2nd litter box all the time? If we leave the door closed to the room with the 2nd box, will she know it’s there when we open it?",tsladew12,2022-11-16,10:16:01,2022,11,16,10,16,Wednesday
1,CatAdvice,Advice on if I should adopt a kitten or not,"Hi I’ve been wanting to adopt a kitten but I’m not sure if I should. I live in a house where I have two rooms to myself. There’s a 1yr old cat and a 10month old corgi living in the house as well. I’m a college student so I’m out 2 out of the 7 days of the week the whole day. 
I’m just curious what I need to do to take care of cats and what I should prepare for. (My roommate doesn’t really take her cat to the vets and stuff like that) I’m just worried that once I get this kitten, they get too attached to the cat and I’m moving out in about half a year to a year so I’m not sure. 
Should I adopt a kitten or a young cat? All my friends who adopted cats got kittens and was able to train them to handle cuddles and nail trims without trouble (which would be awesome if I can find a very cuddly cat)",immaninjanow,2022-11-16,09:50:41,2022,11,16,9,50,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,Kitty on the shoulders?,"Ok so I haven’t really owned a cat since my early 20’s…..I’m now in my 40’s. In the last couple years I had a “porch kitty” that came up during winter and it broke my heart how cold it was so I fed it, gave a warm house. When I moved about 8 months ago, I made sure to find my porch kitty a good home so she didn’t feel abandoned. Since moving, I found a kitten in the bushes crying for it’s mama. (I can’t help myself, if it needs help…..I’ll help) Since then, this cat has been to the vet multiple times for shots, etc and my kids love her, so we adopted her. Gorgeous female orange which we now call Nala. Ok so she was supposed to be the kids pets, buuut I can’t help myself, I love animals so I tend to play, and give her snacks, and cuddle her and give her the attention my kids do not give her. And now, she’s a happy, energetic, playful, suuuper sweet kitty. BUT, recently she has started jumping on my shoulders. I can tell when she’s about to jump, so I brace myself, there’s never been a minute where I’m startled…..but I’m curious why she does this? Is this affection? Just height preference? And it’s only me she does this with. She’ll come when I use her name, and when my husband calls her, she’ll come so I think she prefers us compared to the kids, but she seems to get along with everyone in the house. I just don’t know why she is only jumping on me? Is this a bad thing?",hsayab,2022-11-16,06:06:28,2022,11,16,6,6,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,"Can't find wet food for kittens, are the adult versions okay?","I have two 5-month old kittens. It has been a struggle finding food they like, they are both very picky even though they were strays living by a dumpster until I took them in. 

One of them seems to love a specific brand of kitten dry food, which is great. The other one doesn't mind it, but he seems to grow bored after a while and won't continue eating it later in the day. He has reacted like this to every dry food I have tried, so I think he's just not a fan of dry food in general.  

I recently discovered that he loves wet pate food. The only problem is I can't find any wet food for kittens, even the non-pate kind. I have checked every single supermarket and pet store in the city. 

I have looked online, and there's some (but not much), and the prices are double and triple what the prices are for adult food in the local stores. Also, there's no Amazon here so the shipping prices are pretty bad. 

Right now I have been giving both of them the dry kitten food and the adult mousse food, but my one cat doesn't eat as much as the dry food and so I give him a larger portion of the wet food. 

I have an appointment with the vet for their next vaccine dose, but it's not for two weeks. Do you think it's alright to keep giving them the adult wet food until then?",MissTzatziki,2022-11-16,04:09:07,2022,11,16,4,9,Wednesday

I work from home so I am around but am working, so I can let her out on the porch once a day and throw her a toy here and there.

Is there anything I can do to keep her busy or get her energy out enough that she’ll chill when I’m working?

1,CatAdvice,Cat diet?,"I have two cats, one aged 11 (Max) who is very long and slim and looks healthy (12lbs), and one aged 9 (Oreo) who has always been small but chunky. Recently Oreo has been gaining weight and is now an astonishing 16lbs. I feel awful that I let it go on that long but we were going through an incredibly stressful time and just didn't notice because she often hides. She seems otherwise healthy. We've always been able to leave out the food and the cats have regulated how much they need to eat, but over time we've realized that Oreo is a snacker and she keeps coming back for more food. We're trying to figure out how to help her lose weight, and how to set out the food so both cats are eating an appropriate amount. We've tried 2x/day feedings by separating the cats and by putting one dish up high where the other can't reach. Neither of those options have worked- maybe they are just so used to having access to food all day and are confused. I thought Oreo would come running every morning when I fill the dish but she doesn't come until close to the time I have to leave for work, so she doesn't eat much.

Any similar experiences? Advice on how to find a balance for both cats?

1,CatAdvice,doubtful about my parents’ arrangement for our cats while we’re away,"sorry for the long read. there’s nothing i can do now so it’s more of a rant. 

we are being forced to leave the country due to some immigration issues - i won’t go into it but it’ll be 2 to 3 months depending on if our visa renewal is approved quick. 

i’ve already been stressing out on missing months of school and life in general, but now, the night before we leave, i’m starting to worry about our 2 cats. 

our only real choice is to keep them in this house. all the airlines to our destination will only ship the cats as cargo (not even necessarily on the same plane). nearby boarding facilities have come back to us saying they can’t keep them for such a long time. my parents told me to find one of my friends to catsit for us, and there was literally only one that was willing to do it.

the problem is, she’s really busy and it wouldn’t be fair for her to come out to the middle of nowhere (we live in the middle of nowhere) every day, so my parents told her every other day. i’m scared this isn’t often enough. 

the plan is my friend will come every other day and refill food bowls that we’ve put all over the house, and change the water too. 

only one of the cats is fond of playing, and my friend is free to use any of the cat toys lying around (we also have some toys that the cats can play with without assistance). 

the cats have already met her and though they aren’t in love, they don’t mind her. they’re good with rationing food and aren’t big drinkers. 

i still think it’s concerning to only have a person come once every two days - i have been bringing up the option of finding someone else to fill the gaps, but my mother shut me down and said it was fine and the cats would be okay. we also have the common problem of money (plane tickets are very expensive). 

i’m just so scared, but now it’s just too late to do anything. i have other friends that can maybe come visit every so often, but this is the only person who lives close enough to come on a regular basis, my other friends all live 2 hours away with public transport. 

i really hope nothing goes wrong and we can come back sooner than expected.",DragonWelfareNRights,2022-11-16,01:46:14,2022,11,16,1,46,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,I want to get rid of my 5 month old kitten because of his constant attacks on me and I’m worried my gf will dump me if I do,"Every night my cat is attacking and clawing at my sheets hard, I have scratches all over my body, he curls around my head and rabbit kicks me and bites my hair.  If my hands lay outside the covers he will attack my arms and draw blood frequently.

During the day he is fine, enjoyable sometimes even and I always make sure to play with him as much as possible, but I just can’t take the nights anymore.  If I do so much as sit down on my bed he will eventually start attacking me.

He wakes me up multiple times through the night with his attacks, and I know cats do this when they want to play, but it’s past the point of “play fighting.”  I play with him to the point of his exhaustion every night before bed and he still does this.

I live in an apartment with two roommates, I leave my door open so the cat can go outside of my room but he would rather stay and bite me all night.

I can’t live like this anymore, I don’t know what to do about his behavior and feel like giving him away is the only choice I have.  I’d love to hear any advice that isn’t “play with him” because I seriously play with him all the time and this isn’t play aggression this is just plain aggressive behavior every night.  I feel bad because me and my gf found him together in a parking lot, and he we took him to the vet and everything, but I just can’t take him anymore and it’s to the point where I avoid coming back to my own apartment some days just to avoid my cat.",BagsofBees,2022-11-15,23:08:09,2022,11,15,23,8,Tuesday

1,CatAdvice,Kitten meows but wife refuses to get a playmate,"Hi, my wife and I recently got a kitten at 14 weeks old, the kitten is gentle with our hands when playing, very good natured so far, love him so much already! We're only on week 2 with him so early days.

&amp;#x200B;

My concern comes in with his meowing. He only aims these meows at me, he doesn't go to or meow at my wife even though she plays with him and feeds him too, I think its because the kitten knows she won't respond. We are both at home 24/7, I tend to respond because I'm worried that he's bored.

&amp;#x200B;

We're trying to set a routine of playing with him at set times, roughly 5 times a day for 15 mins - 45 depending on how free we are. Is this enough?

I would be very happy to get a second kitten but I've nagged my wife about it to the point where she just gets mad if I even mention it, she outright refuses to talk about it now.

1,CatAdvice,how much work can a second cat take?,"it's been a long time and many stupid obstacles, but my partner and i can finally get a second cat

our assumption is that it will be time consuming and stressful, and considering this affects when we will actually adopt one - end of this month or February.

i want to hear about how easy/stressful/time consuming you found it?

we're going to personality match as best we can, and get a younger cat hopefully less formed in their personality (like a teen),  and do the proper separated introduction method, but yeah... i feel like i am bracing for the worst?

not because our existing cat seems like he would be hostile to it or anything, but just because getting him was such a MASSIVE learning curve and he completely consumed our time and attention when we first got him",we_all_poo_question,2022-11-15,16:54:41,2022,11,15,16,54,Tuesday

1,CatAdvice,"My Cat is Suddenly Aggressive, what do I do?","We have 4 cats (2 female 2 male, the males are siblings, though potentially different fathers) and our fourth, Ollie, has become aggressive whenever he comes home. We used to have only three cats, Ollie, his brother, and another cat. he was nice and enjoyed cuddles and would sit wit us on beds and couches. A while (maybe a few months) he started leaving home and coming back later each time. Apparently other houses were feeding him ham or something I don't really know the full details.  
Out in the neighbourhood when I see him he is nice and lets me pat him but as soon as he comes home, which is usually around once a month, he hisses and growls and looks for a way out of the house.  


He has always been good at escaping and we've had to put a wooden board to stop him escaping the cat flap. I'm unsure wether this issue is to do with the kitten or maybe if he has another house that he likes more, but this has been going on for around 2 years now and it's really disheartening to see your cat annoyed at you all the time.

1,CatAdvice,"My disabled cat loves crawling under my blanket, is this a problem?","My cat has osteopetrosis and because of this his blood circulation (among many other things) is out of whack. He gets colder than my other animals every fall/winter so I have multiple heating pads laid out in his favorite spots, including my bed. But sometimes he just likes a good cuddle against my core under the blankets at night. And so do I! But, because of his condition, I worry about his actual limitations versus most cats limitations. I have a relatively light, fluffy blanket at the moment but as we get deeper into the winter I will be incorporating something thicker (or doubling up). I'm an experienced cat owner and I know that many bed worries about cats are solved by the cats themselves (i.e. what if I roll over onto them? what if they get too hot/cold? Etc) but I'm concerned that my cat's disability could somehow limit his oxygen under any blanket but especially a good winter one. He often completely submerges himself, head and all, under the blanket and he has gotten up and wobbled himself out once he seemed to feel warm enough. But is CO2 poisoning something I need to be aware of for him? Are most cats aware of risks like that? I'm trying to imagine a cat getting dizzy from breathing too much CO2 and getting away from the source, but I imagine that's a rare occurrence at best.

1,CatAdvice,Cat throwing up but acting normal otherwise,"I have a 3 1/2 year old cat who I raised primarily through quarantine (got him only a couple months before COVID hit). He's lived the majority of his life so far with me and my 3 other roommates while I was in school. In June of this year I graduated and moved back home with him and a couple weeks after the move he started vomiting a lot. During this period of about 2 weeks he vomited almost once a day if not more and couldn't really keep any food down. Took him to the vet and he had a small fever and they kept him overnight on an IV, gave him antibiotics, blood tests, and x-rays. While there he had no problems keeping food down and nothing was found on the blood tests or x-rays. The fever went away after his stay overnight and I was able to take him home with some medicine to sprinkle on his food for the following 2 weeks. 

Flash forward about 2 and a half months later and he starts vomiting again. Not nearly as much or intensely as the first time but still regularly enough for it to cause concern. I take him back to the vet and they say everything about him is healthy other than that he is a bit underweight ( He's been sitting at 8 lbs ever since July and he's usually 10). They give me deworming meds just in case + some probiotic powder for his food and sent him home. After that he doesn't vomit for about a month and a half but isn't really gaining back any weight. Then about a week ago he began vomiting again about every other day. 

During this time my family and I have tried wet food, single ingredient foods, expensive kibble, kibble for sensitive cats, grain-free kibble, and nothing has been able to stop him from vomiting. He really misses kibble even though most of the time that seems to trigger the vomit and he won't eat that much of his wet food. I've scheduled another vet appointment but I'm honestly so confused on what's been happening to him. 

Some other key things:

\- He never had anything like this happen in the 3 years I've had him BEFORE we moved this summer

\- Throughout all of this I haven't found any blood in any of his pee, poop, or vomit

\- He has the same levels of energy and acts completely normal after/between vomiting. Whenever he gets his daily zoomies he literally runs laps around the house

But yeah not sure if its a psychological thing, like the move stressed him out and now he has a really sensitive stomach? Or if it's something way more serious. Any advice is appreciated!",Advanced-Grape22,2022-11-15,14:01:04,2022,11,15,14,1,Tuesday

1,CatAdvice,Sweet kitty has accident while I had company,"I have 2 sibling cats. A very outgoing male and a shy calico. The calico is very cuddly and a tad possessive with me though. I just went through a very rough period with her, where she would tinkle in the bed, sometimes even straight on me while I was sleeping.  

I tried the scientific approach: changing each variable in isolation. Needless to say, I did A LOT of laundry over the last couple of weeks.

Steps:
(1) Checked for medical problems.
(2) Then I thought she was hungry at night and was trying to wake me up for food. So I bought automatic feeders.
(3) Took the roof of the litter boxes
(4) Put additional litter boxes
(5) changed the location of the litter boxes

All of this was to no avail until:

(6) I changed the (expensive) litter with cheap ass litter and the problem disappeared just like that. Problem solved...

Last weekend I had some company overnight. My love life is such that this is a very rare occasion, so the cats are not used to that 😄 We were sitting on the sofa and calico looked desperate to be involved: she saw me, my companion and her brother all sitting together, but was too scared and shy to come closer. You could see the panic in her face. She was finally brave enough to come stand on the sofa with us, where she quietly tinkled and left. We didn't even notice until half hour later.

When I found out, I gave her extra attention and treats and reassured her it's ok to have an accident. You can't imagine the purrs she gave me. I'd like to think I reassured her that she is still my number 1 girl :) Luckily this was a one-off and she resumed standard litter box duties right away.

In the interest of my love life, any further tips you can give me to prevent such accidents when I have company, would be most welcome :)",flieterke,2022-11-15,12:22:36,2022,11,15,12,22,Tuesday

Of course, my cat immediately peed on the futon to mark her territory. We replaced the futon with a brand new couch, but my cat continued to pee on it. We have tried EVERYTHING to get her to stop. Over the course of the last few months, we have:

\- taken her to the vet (she has a clean bill of health)

\- moved the new couch

\- put a tarp over the new couch (she finds a way under the tarp)

\- gotten new litter

\- she has 2 large litter boxes

\- switched her food

\- tried Feliway

\- tried spraying the couch with the spray that kills the cat's pheromones or whatever attracts the cat back to that spot

How can I get her to use a heated bed/box? I tried spraying volatized catnip in it and that worked last night but not today. I also took the food away so that it doesn't attract the racoons. I tried snacks but she wasn't interested. Instead she curls up on the porch sofa and looks very cold and pathetic. How cold is too cold for cats to be outdoors and healthy?

1,CatAdvice,Newly Adopted Cat Only Comes Out at Night...?,"Help! On October 28th, I adopted a one-year-old female cat. The foster parents (that she spent about 9 months with in their apartment with three other cats) said she's a very chill and friendly. After taking her home to my apartment (keeping her in the bedroom), she would NOT come out from under the bed. It took her three days to start eating and drinking and using the litter box. We are now nearing the end of week 3, and her behavior is so interesting to me. She only comes out at night (unless I'm not home - I have cameras set up to watch her) and she lets me pet her while I'm laying in bed. She uses the cat tree I got her, sits in the window, and even plays with some toys; however, as soon as the sun rises or if she notices I'm awake, she goes RIGHT back underneath the bed and will not come out. It's like she's totally afraid of me and I can't get near her during the day, even though she lets me pet her and lay with her at night. Almost as if she thinks I'm a completely different entity during the day. I've tried playing with her, laying on the floor and talking to her, blocking off the bed (but she keeps finding ways under there), giving her treats - nothing. She's deathly afraid of me during the day. What should I do???? I'm not new to cats (I grew up with them) but this is my first time adopting &amp; introducing an ""older"" cat to a new home.

I have posted here before and got lots of good advice. My cats, Lola and Linus, are very settled in here and are fitting in great. I was wondering though...

I live in an apartment complex and the cats HATE their carriers (we are working on that). But, I am scared if the fire alarm ever goes out, we may need to get them out ASAP and other tenants have dogs etc. I want to harness train them and get them to where they LOVE their harnesses and we can slip them on no issue. Their stats are: CAT 1, female, 6-6.5 lbs, domestic medium hair, very dainty with a teeney neck and chest. CAT 2, male, domestic medium hair maine coon mix, definitely at least 13 lbs and growing, beefy chest and is heavy like an anvil.

1,CatAdvice,"My cat is behaving differently, and lunges at us and bites really hard, how do I stop it?","The reason might be obvious, he was home alone for two weeks and my cousin would feed him and clean his litter everyday, would play too but rarely. So he probably has a lot of energy that he hasn’t used. We are back now for good and his behaviour has changed. 
Before this he used to come sleep next to me on his own and sometimes at night he would bite my arm but kinda gently. But now he yowls in the middle of the night and I have to come get him to bed. And then he lunges and attacks to “capture my arm” to bite  (really hard). (All while purring) He did it several times and I had to put him out of the room. 
I’ve been playing with him more to fix this but it doesn’t seem to work. He also attacks the stick of the cat toy than the toy itself. (That is he jumps up and tries to catch the stick) He never used to do that either. Also getting another cat to keep him company is not possible due to budget issues.

The most I’ve ever let him “go hungry” to encourage eating something other than plain dry food was one meal because I’m worried about him getting fatty liver. He’s good about drinking water from his fountain a few times daily, but I’m worried the dry food isn’t good for him in the long run. 

Is there anything I’m missing here or am I just stuck with my stubborn dry food boy?",DefiantHyena5633,2022-11-15,07:03:59,2022,11,15,7,3,Tuesday

1,CatAdvice,Cat nonstop meowing (not for medical reasons),"My 3-year-old tortoiseshell cat, Ginger, is meowing nonstop lately, and I’m really becoming bothered by it.

My boyfriend and I live in an apartment with her. 
She experiences what seems in my opinion to be severe boredom.

She is spayed. She is up to date with the vet and no medical concerns.

We have several toys for her, but she just stares at them when I try to play with her. However, if I do nothing, she also just meows repeatedly for attention.

This is combined with her meowing because my boyfriend is about to be home and she’s excited. Unfortunately, I work from home and this is making things frustrating.

Finally, she begs for food and meows around her dinner time. After her dinner, my boyfriend is about to arrive home. So for about two hours straight every afternoon I am tortured. 
She also does it early in the morning when she’s awake and excited, and so unfortunately I don’t sleep very well.

Oh and we tried to get another cat. She hated the kitten and was territorial. So that’s out too.

Sorry if I seem frustrated and cold. I love her more than life and she is my baby. Just so tired of it.

1,CatAdvice,Mixed signs from cat,"I have this cat that I found meowing on the streets for attention, i believe she is only a couple of months old. She drinks and eats just fine. Sleeps a lot and its difficult to engage her in play. However, whenever I enter a room she is in she lowers her body, head to the ground and such and its my belief that she feels anxious and scared of me. She never scratched or bit me when I approach her in that state and I pet her to make sure its all fine. Whats weird too is that when I sit down on the couch she comes up to me and sits on my lap, even if i remove her she comes back on it again, so i don't understand why she is anxious in other situations. What sorta hurt me the most is whenever I go outside with her to let her play around she reacts to other peoples ""pspsps"" but never to mine, whenever I do it she just looks at me and stays still.

1,CatAdvice,New cat (2.5F) swiping/hissing/biting. Shelter knew about behaviours but did not tell us.,"5 weeks ago we adopted a 2.5 year old female who when we got her home, was INCREDIBLY stressed. She wouldn’t sleep, wouldn’t stop pacing, had blood in her stool from stress. Eventually she was put on 100mg of gabapentin daily which helped but now she’s settling in, she’s becoming aggressive with my partner and I.

When we met her in the shelter, they told us she was shy at first but loves people and is happy around other cats. That was it. Yesterday we emailed the shelter who advised they knew about these behaviours and actually had her on 200mg of gabapentin a day to keep her relaxed. We weren’t told any of this, we weren’t even sent home with any medications for her. They then told us that we are unable to return her if it’s not a good fit and it’ll be classified as a surrender which we will have to pay for. I was furious and distraught that this information was withheld from us.

We’re relatively new cat parents and we don’t have the experience to modify these behaviours, let alone try to do so without being told the extent of it from the beginning. We don’t want to give up on her and we’re taking her to our own vet tomorrow morning to see what they say but I feel AWFUL. She deserves a home that can give her the time and patience she deserves. 

We also told the shelter with Christmas coming up we will have family around (including young kids) and their solution was ‘put her in a room’. Which granted, we would likely have to do anyway because she cannot be around new people in a scenario like that but they felt so unsupportive.

I’m so heartbroken, I want what’s best for this cat but it feels like we were set to fail from the very beginning.",tronksy,2022-11-15,05:14:36,2022,11,15,5,14,Tuesday

1,CatAdvice,New cat suddenly hissing,"I started fostering my first cat on Friday. She's incredibly shy and spent the first 9 hrs in her crate. She didnt respond to petting but did let me pet her without aggression. During the night of the Friday I got her she decided to place herself behind the toilet of my only bathroom and has decided thats her safe space. Her litter box and food bowl are now in there although she barely eats. I'm nervous about her being in there because she gets visibly scared when I flush the toilet and use the shower. I've been reading and hearing conflicting things about whether I should pet and talk to her or just leave her alone. Today I've mostly left her alone but have obviously had to use the bathroom to shower and use the toilet and sink. About two hours after the shower I went to visit her and stuck my hand out and she hissed at me. This is the first time she has hissed. Is it something I did? Is it the noise of the shower? Its unfortunate because she has parked herself behind the toilet and refuses to move. I obviously need to shower so theres nothing I can do there...

TLDR: new shy foster cat thst has been hiding behind the toilet and has left me pet her but didnt respond suddenly hissed when I got near her today.",sammyyam22,2022-11-15,04:33:20,2022,11,15,4,33,Tuesday

1,CatAdvice,Help with biting cat: playing doesn’t work!,"Hello everyone! First time poster here, apologies if I need to edit this in any way

I adopted a 6 (now 7 month) kitten about a month ago. She is adorable, but she seems to be bored no matter what I do. She’s started displaying behavioral issues like biting hands/feet and biting and scratching furniture. We have many scratching posts, but I think she’s learned that scratching and biting furniture=someone is going to pull her away and give her attention, so she continues to bite and scratch them. I’m going to try double sided tape to get her to stop that. But the bigger issue is her biting. I know that when a kitten bites it means they are bored, so whenever she does that I try to play with her, but she often times ignores the toys I try to use and keeps going for hands and feet! I have multiple dangly toys (stuffed things attached to a stick with a string, unsure what the correct name is) a few catnip filled stuff toys that I throw for her to chase, as well as a motion activated toy and some noisy balls on a track that she likes to bat around. Sometimes dangling or throwing something works, but a lot of times she seems barely interested in it, she’ll lay on her back and bat it around a little and then get bored and try to attack our hands and feet again. I know she likes these toys, because sometimes we get a great session in and she really leaps for it and wears herself out, but a lot of time nothing I do gets her interested in playing with anything but our flesh. 

I’m really not sure what I’m doing wrong here. I had a cat my entire childhood but she was a lazy rag doll, I’m clearly a bit out of my depth with a tortie kitten. It’s started to become a genuine issue, potentially damaging my nice furniture is bad enough, but I don’t know how to work from home when she demands constant attention yet doesn’t care for playing with anything but my hands and feet!

1,CatAdvice,HELP! Cat peeing everywhere around the house,"First things first, she's 7 months old and yes she hasn't been spayed yet. Her spay appointment was on 8th November but it was postponed to 6th December. She is currently on her second heat and literally peeing on everything that's made of fabric. Not spraying, just urinating normally by squatting. I have tried my best to clean up after her using enzyme cleaners but she just keeps peeing anyway. She does pee in the litter box when I put her manually and I do keep the litter box clean.

She actually had that habit of peeing outside her litter box since I adopted her at 3 months old but it wasn't as frequent. Anytime she saw any clothing on the bed(even a blanket) or on the floor, she'd pee on it. We managed to get it under control by moving the blankets and clothes from the bed immediately after we're done though she still peed on the couch sometimes. She also has a habit of holding her pee in as long as she can. I heard UTIs could also be the cause and talked to the vet about it but she ruled it out.

So now on top of her constant yowling and screaming combined with the frequent peeing habit is driving everyone nuts. I love her to death but I cannot keep cleaning after her multiple times every single day. 

Will spaying get rid of this peeing problem? I heard the longer a cat is allowed to pee like that during heat, the harder it is to get rid of this habit even after spaying. Her appointment is still 3 weeks away and that means there'll be another heat after the current one which means more peeing if she hasn't developed the habit already. I'm so stressed out. Has anyone experienced this before? Any advice is appreciated.",Illustrious_Yak_1074,2022-11-15,02:24:26,2022,11,15,2,24,Tuesday

He used to go outside with my mom a lot, typically supervised but either way my mom has always had in/out door cats because there is not a lot of traffic nearby. Some neighbors of ours have very big dogs (akitas I believe) that came into our garage (they were unleashed and not supposed to be on our property but that's another story). They were about 3 seconds away from eating the cat before my mom got them to leave.  Long story short now we have a fence for protection and the dog situation is handled. However her cat is very nervous of any noise and going outside. It definitely seems trauma related. Does this go away with time or is there other steps we can take to make our cat feel more normal?

1,CatAdvice,Leaving cats while on vacation,"these types of questions have been asked her previously and I always read the posts and comments as I like seeking advice on the matter too but thought I’d offer my own story

I live in a small one bed apartment - I have a single cat, she’s about 2 years old. She’s friendly and quite attached to me but she’s equally friendly and curious when people come over. 

I’ve been on vacations since I got her, and so far my bf crashes at mine to look after her which means she’s had no changes to her routine. Recently I’ve been sleeping over at my bfs from time to time but still making sure her feeding schedule is undisturbed (to get her used to spending nights alone). She’s been fine with that too

My question is, I’m comfortable leaving her with drop in visits from a sitter (once or twice a day) if I go away for 2-4 days. But have you guys left your cat at home with only drop in visits for about 30 min for 2 weeks at a time? I could also drop her off at boarders I’ve found on Rover but idk what the better option is since I’ve heard cats prefer to stay in their space. But I’m worried that she’ll get lonely all by herself for that long. 

Also do you guys get one drop in visit per day or two? My cats fed wet food twice a day which is the issue if I go away— I’ll have to get someone to drop in twice a day",saiclops_,2022-11-14,23:21:01,2022,11,14,23,21,Monday

1,CatAdvice,Cat will stay over with friend during vacation. Any tips for making it as smooth and stress-free possible?,"Hi everyone!

My BF and I have a cat together and we will be going on a two-week vacation overseas soon. It will be the first time he will be away from home for so long and consequently the first time the cat will be staying at a friend’s flat.

Besides the basics (litter box, litter, and food) this is what we are planning on taking with her to our friend’s flat:
- her blanket
- one blanket we have on the sofa that has our smell
- one of my t-shirts and one of my bf’s T-Shirt
- two of her favourite toys
- treats
- her cat grass
- the basket she sleeps in during the day
- a scratching post

Is there anything else we could take with her that would make her stay more comfortable?

I’m also worried about the timing of taking her over to our friend’s flat. My instinct is to have her as long as possible with us and only take her there as the last thing. But I think it might end up being too stressful for everyone involved. My BF is of the same opinion and suggested taking her there ca. 48h before our flight, so we can even stay there a bit for her to settle in. What would be best?

1,CatAdvice,advice for leaving pet cats while on vacation? pls!,"I have two cats. One is 2.8yo and the other is 1.7yo. My family has been thinking of going on a vacay that’s about 10-15 days long. The issue is that we don’t know what to do with our cats. 

My older one is a very anxious cat and we don’t think we can leave it at a pet hotel safely. My second one is a bit more calm and can be trusted if left alone at someone’s place but I don’t wanna separate them.

1,CatAdvice,"(UK) Moved house with cat, usual routine is he wakes me up at the crack of dawn to go outside. Obviously I won’t be letting him outside for another month or so.. any advice on what to do about the wake up calls appreciated.","6 year old cat. He is used to waking up around 3-5am, being let outside and when we wake up for work a few hours later I bring him in for breakfast before he’s out again for a little while, and then bring him back in before I go to work. 

It’s our second night and he’s now settled in a bit more - he’s kept me awake for a couple of hours meowing to go out. He’ll try to nibble me if I ignore him for too long. I’ve been playing with him but I can’t be doing that every morning at 3am. 
He’s usually in for most of the day when I am at work, there is someone at home but they can’t always let him in or out so I like him to have those few hours in the morning.
What do I do for the next few weeks? I need my sleep and I don’t want him to be bored or stressed. I’m going to get some more interactive toys, I guess he’s used to using more energy running outside and is now getting frustrated.",SunnyRoseGlitter,2022-11-14,14:24:38,2022,11,14,14,24,Monday
1,CatAdvice,Cats Fighting After I'm Away,"I have two cats, a first for me, I've always had only one. They are roughly a year apart and have been together since I adopted the youngest at eight weeks. They sleep together, groom each other, eat side by side, and other than one particular spot on the cat tower aren't territorial.

I went away this weekend, from Friday to Sunday. They had automatic feeders and my sister checked on them Saturday (I've since checked, she said they were behaving normally). I got home this evening, they didn't come greet me at the door. First I found the older one, then the younger one came in the room but they started hissing at each other. The younger one was also soaking wet (I think they fought near the water bowl as there was a huge puddle), had scratches and was acting terrified while the older one was puffing up and acting like he'd never seen the younger one in his life.

I know this can happen when cats are separated, say a vet visit or something but it has never happened with them after a vet visit or in the rate occasion the older one gets out the house. There was nothing that would have changed how they smelled or seemed to each other. Just my absence and I've left for the weekend before. 

They've been separated since I've been home, the baby mostly with me since he was the most shaken up, though he seems much calmer now. They ate on each a side of a door for dinner. But the older one saw me moving the baby (we were rotating rooms so everyone was set up for the night but isolated rather than their usual run of the house) and he puffed up and started hissing again.

I'm just so confused about what could have happened. Any ideas on how to avoid this in the future and any advice other than/on top of reintroduction which is the current plan, is appreciated.",anurbannomad,2022-11-14,13:11:56,2022,11,14,13,11,Monday

1,CatAdvice,I think my roommate is neglecting her cat and I don't know what to do,"Hi everyone, I hope this type of post is allowed. I'm not asking for medical advice or anything, I am just frustrated and need advice from other cat owners. My roommate has a cat and she is the sweetest cat ever. This past summer we moved into an apartment and the cat began peeing all over the stairs. This was extremely abnormal since she never did this in our old apartment and is often well behaved and relaxed. I know the peeing outside of the litter box can be caused by stress from the new environment, plus my roommate has been extremely inconsistent with cleaning the litter box. I made it very clear that I am worried about the cat, the unclean litter box's impact on the cat, the damages to the stairs, and that the cat pee smell is completely unbearable. Everyone that I bring over makes comments about the smell and my friends who are cat owners tell me that the smell will most likely never come out. Due to this, we had to get the carpet torn out of the stairs. The peeing stopped for a bit but then started again, except this time on the wood that was under the carpet. I begged my roommate to take her to the vet or find remedies to help the cat to stop peeing on the stairs. My roommate then buys some UTI medicine online and says that's the most she can do. Also, I forgot to mention that we have tried every form of cleaner to get the cat pee out. It doesn't get rid of the smell, but it does conceal it for a day or two. With all of this being said, I am so stressed. I have tried everything to make it clear to my roommate that this cat needs medical attention and the cat pee smell is spreading all over the apartment. She responds by saying that she's doing everything she can and she is already dealing with too much in regards to schoolwork. I am so tired of worrying about this. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you.",nicole890,2022-11-14,12:34:29,2022,11,14,12,34,Monday

1,CatAdvice,5 month old male cat constantly crying at front door.,"So my fiancé &amp; I live in a small one bedroom apartment and we recently got a kitten whom we love absolutely dearly. The entrance to our unit has a tiny hallway that leads to the other three units on our floor. We opened up our front door to get some mail one day, and he curiously wandered out into the hallway. The hallway is closed off by doors and theres no way for him to escape so we let him sniff around and explore for a couple minutes then brought him back inside in our unit. Ever since then, he will sit at the front door and cry and meow and it seems as though he wants to go back out to the hallway. I try to distract him with toys, treats, anything. But after a couple minutes he’ll just go back to crying at the door. It gets quite frustrating hearing him yell at us for hours on end. I’m nervous if I let him back out there, i’m encouraging the behavior that crying at door=getting what he wants. I don’t know if that makes me sound like a bad cat mom but I am just not a fan of him being out in that hallway in case another tenant walks in and they get upset or my cat runs out the building once they open the outside door. We have been kind of ignoring the cries/distracting him with other things currently and was kind of hoping after some time he’d lose interest and forget about it but its been a couple weeks and it’s still a daily occurrence. Is he bored? Any advice appreciated, thank you!",lunarconcept,2022-11-14,11:20:42,2022,11,14,11,20,Monday

1,CatAdvice,Adopted two ‘bonded’ cats,"We adopted two bonded cats last week and we are worried they aren’t bonded at all. The humane society (Toronto based shelter rescue) assessed these two cats and concluded that they are bonded so we were excited to take both home. 

One is female, 3 years old. Spayed. The other is a boy, 2 years old and neutered recently. 

They seem fine on their own, super affectionate with us, playful, not stressed at all. Eating well, drinking lots of water. Beyond that though, they seem to avoid each other. He’s fairly indifferent to her but she actively dislikes him any time he’s near her. She will growl, hiss and swat at him if he gets close. Him being younger and full of bouncy energy, and our place being a condo, this causes issues. 

We don’t have any experience with bonded cats so we don’t know if this is going to change as they get more comfortable. We also don’t know if we should trust the assessment of the place we got them from. They’ve been radio silent on the concerns we have posed to them and are not calling us back.

My biggest concern is we live in a 700sq foot condo in the city. There is enough room here for them to avoid each other and have their space but keeping two unbonded cats in a space this small for the next decade or more seems unfair to them. Like I said though, I’m not a cat expert, I just trusted the assessment the humane society gave us. 

Any help here is super appreciated. We already love these little guys so much, we just want them to be as comfortable as possible.",voidpush,2022-11-14,11:16:59,2022,11,14,11,16,Monday

1,CatAdvice,Thinking about getting a kitten and keeping it in my bedroom! (PC in room as well 😭),"Hey!

So the tittle is pretty self-explanatory but I have a dog and some other family members in my house, we’re still sorting out the finer details of me getting my own kitten to take care of but I was wondering if I should be worried about protecting my pc cables since I’ve heard kittens will chew through cords especially but wasn’t too sure on how to protect cords/wiring!

I’ve done a lot of research otherwise and I volunteer at a shelter which I’ve done work with cats/kittens so I’m pretty well versed with all types of animals in general and behaviours etc so I’m not too worried about that, in case anyone was wondering :)


Another thing that I’d like to ask about with a litter box, if I’m keeping the litter box in my room for bare minimum a few weeks or even months depending on how the kitten adjusts to the change, is there anyway to make sure the litter doesn’t totally stink up my room? 

I’ve heard good things about pine pellets and a sifter litter but wasn’t too sure if a basic clay clump based litter would do the trick for a relatively small bedroom!

(I also plan on putting in a cat tree as well as using some kind of ikea shelves dyi type of setup to add some verticality as steps to give the kitten some more room!)",Whole-Cheesecake7758,2022-11-14,10:06:05,2022,11,14,10,6,Monday

1,CatAdvice,cat gets aggressive when I'm trying to give her treats,"I have a 3 year old female cat that I adopted a few months ago. she's super sweet and affectionate until I try to give her any kind of treat. I want to be able to use treats as positive enforcement for when she does things I like, but it's too scary right now! 

when she sees that I have treats, she begins huffing and hissing and her eyes get huge and she lunges at me whenever I get my hand close enough to give her a treat. she often bites my hand as I try to offer her a treat. what's weird about this is that she does not exhibit this behavior with her regular food (which she does seem to love since she's very prompt about demanding her food and gets very excited when I'm filling her bowl) to the point where I can take food out of the bowl while she's eating and she doesn't even blink.

she was a stray and I imagine that that's why she has some food aggression - I just can't tell how to solve this. if I withhold a treat because she bit me she gets really agitated, but hardly any less agitated as she is after she eats one treat and expects another. honestly it scares me to give her treats because of how aggressive she can get.

do y'all have any advice for how I can get her to cool down a little when I'm trying to reward her?",Unusual_Duck6444,2022-11-14,10:00:32,2022,11,14,10,0,Monday

But basically I had two cats since kittens I didn't really want but took them on and started  to tolerate them as qthey grew older. I was dating someone that suddenly passed away with two mature cats.. They were barely warming up to me while I was there. She didn't have many friends and the ones that were there didn't want them, her parents were talking about euthanasia. I didn't want them separated and I decided to take them on because they were her life and I wanted her to live on with them and be taken care of. Only issue is I live in a small 1 bedroom 667sqft condo. They get along with my cats, not so much me. I'm trying to comfort them as much as I can at a distance with food and treats at every corner. My two cats have been overly energetic running around, eating their food so I can't make sure how much her cats getting. My cats have been extra cuddly and snuggly especially at bed I guess to protect me. But also when I scold my cats they'll run behind hers for protection as ill probably get swatted. I'm trying to at least get them all in the same littler box and food but hers are mature. Her cats were on some low grade frisskies with food like mine but they can't tolerate it anymore. I've just been giving it to them as comfort and make sure they eat. They were on friskie kibble while mine are on a grain free salmon diet. Is there any way I can transition them to eating the same thing? What kind of feeders or litter boxes would you suggest? I'm thinking of self feeders and a self cleaner.

1,CatAdvice,8mo kitten attacking 2yo cat,"We have two cats: Trisk (2 years, former stray adopted at 1 year) and Banshee (8mo, adopted from my partner's boss because she wasn't working for their home). Both are spayed. We took Banshee in because Trisk seems like she would benefit from some feline company, and Banshee was causing some behavioral problems when left alone during the day. We had hoped that Banshee would be a good playmate for Trisk, and Trisk would keep Banshee company when there weren't any humans in the house.

We brought her home about 3 weeks ago, and we have our house partitioned off into two sides using baby gates with a thick blanket draped over them. We unfortunately don't have any doors, as we live in a trailer. Trisk and Banshee have had minimal contact through the baby gate, and Trisk seems fine with Banshee, but Banshee is showing a lot of aggression towards Trisk. We regularly have to redirect her from trying to claw and growl at the baby gate, and over the past few days she's learned how to knock it over. Every time she does, she goes for Trisk, hissing and snarling. Trisk seems more confused than anything, and just runs to a safer spot and stares at her instead of trying to fight back. We always separate them as soon as we can when this happens, but Banshee has mauled my hand a few times now for that, and I don't know how to get her to understand that Trisk isn't a threat and leave her alone.

Trisk has met plenty of other cats from her time before we adopted her, as she was part of the local cat colony. She also adored our 18yo cat that we no longer have. Banshee, as far as I know, hasn't met any other cats besides her parents/siblings, but she loves dogs and people, and actively enjoys being picked up except when she's being aggressive towards Trisk. I've seen a lot of people recommend food rewards for being calm towards the other cat, but we haven't found any treats that Banshee is interested in. Neither cat is food aggressive, and they're fed on opposite sides of the house.

At this point, my partner and I plan on building a temporary door so that Banshee can no longer knock over the baby gates. However, that doesn't help the fact that she still seems to hate Trisk. Is there anything we can do to calm her down?

1,CatAdvice,How to Stop One Cat from Hunting the other,"Hi guys,

So I have two cats (1 year old M and 10 month old F). They have been living together for almost a year now. We did slow and proper introductions and they were great together (still are, for the most part). My male cat has always been super playful and rambunctious, my female cat is more chill and quiet. Over the past 2 months, my male cat has been playing rough with my female cat, he's been hunting her and chasing her to the point where she will hiss and hide. However, they share food and cuddle and lick each other all the time too, so it's pretty confusing.

They have never gotten into a full on fight (i.e. no blood drawn and my male cat will usually back away) BUT over the past 2 weeks my female cat has pooped 3 times under the couch/my bed, depending. I think it's related to this hunting behaviour my male cat has been doing (maybe she is afraid to use the box?) This has never ever been an issue before and i'm just not sure what to do. For context, the litter boxes are covered and they have never been an issue. I have two litter boxes and they are far apart in my apartment in quiet areas. I am taking my female cat to the vet to rule out medical issues, but I'm just wondering if anyone has any tips (I rent an apartment, so I can't unfortunately add too many options for climbing/more levels, but they have two cat trees).

If you've experienced this and figured out a good solution, please let me know! I don't know what to do but I just want to make sure they are both happy and I would love not to clean my carpets anymore!",justabitanxious,2022-11-14,06:07:36,2022,11,14,6,7,Monday

1,CatAdvice,Should a comfortably solo adult cat get a playmate?,"I was seeing lots about how kittens in particular should always be adopted in twos in order for them to help each other learn manners like not biting and to help tire each other out and give each other some mental stimulation during the day while the humans are out. My question has to do whether or not this advice of getting two cats also is a good choice for if you have adopted an adult cat, particularly if the adult cat seems content being solo? 

During the summer I had the pleasure of bringing home a wonderful cat who, to my knowledge, is perfectly happy being the solo cat of the house. I was originally worried because I knew she was coming from a house that had many cats, but she hasn't had any destructive behaviours or other signs that she is feeling sad or under-stimulated during the day. She has some zoomies every once in a while and she likes to stay in the same room as her people when we are home, but this doesn't seem needy, just pleasantly affectionate. My partner has intimated that they would love to adopt a second cat, and I'm sure I would love a second one as well, but am worried that adding a new cat might disrupt the routine and balance that my current cat now has. I was told my cat has acted 'sassy' before towards new cats before she got to know them. Any advice is appreciated!",Hufflepunk36,2022-11-14,05:22:24,2022,11,14,5,22,Monday

1,CatAdvice,My cat’s fur actin weird,So I know that when cats get scares they puff of their fur and tails and sometimes even hiss. I notice that on random occasion my cat will sort of puff up all the hair around his body but he never is scared or uncomfortable. He did it randomly today while in my lap and later while sitting on the counter. He’s done it before today too. Is he cold?

1,CatAdvice,"Cat aggressive to older cats. I want to rehome, husband does not. Any advice?","**DIsclaimer: I am not looking for medical advice. We have a vet to discuss medications with, who has given an accurate diagnosis.**

---

My heart breaks writing this.

I have three cats, all indoors only. In 2018, when two of the cats were 8(Female) and 7(Male), we adopted an 8 week old kitten(Male). No one at the adoption agency consulted us about the age gap between our cats potentially causing aggression and issues (We later learned from a vet that the recommended age gap for cats is only 2 years).

After a three week isolation period, the cats met face to face, and aside from typical kitten energy occasionally spooking the older cats, they seemed to get along well.

When the kitten turned 1 year old, we moved to a home, doubling our square footage. Overtime, the kitten seemed to become more aggressive to the older cats.

It is now to the point where the other cats will hiss and run away from the kitten, as he will attack them randomly, and we're not talking a play fight, we're talking a fight fight. It's very clear that he may need to be a solo cat, as he has become very territorial.

We have tried bumping up play time, adding more places for the cats to get off the ground, and now he's been isolated into an office space for about 6 weeks, to attempt ""reintroduction"", at the advice of our vet.

Out vet also recently prescribed liquid alprazolam for him to go on, and after watching videos of cats on this medicine, I do NOT feel comfortable with him on this for an extended period of time.

I am at the point where I would like to rehome him. The adoption agency said they will rehome him no problem, and list that he needs to be a single cat.

My husband is overwhelmingly against this. He does not want to give him up, as he has dealt with a lot of pet loss in his life. I am terrified he will resent me if we decide to rehome the younger cat.

Does anyone have any other suggestions we can try to help keep the younger cat entertained, and keep the peace among our cats? We have two cat trees, tables under windows so they can look out, several toys, treats, and occasional catnip playtime.",Fluffy_Way3457,2022-11-14,04:34:35,2022,11,14,4,34,Monday
1,CatAdvice,cat won’t stop scratching and I’ve tried everything,"I adopted a cat about two months ago, and she’s nearly perfect. She’s never had an issue with her litter box, pretty good temperament, and after a vet appointment, is known to be in perfect health. I posted on here when I first got her to ask for general advice, and I’ve followed it. The only problem is that she will not stop tearing up the carpet.

I grew up in a house with carpet with three cats, two of which came to us declawed, one of which we got as a kitten and were able to keep her claws. In all the years I had them, they never had issues with clawing up the carpet. Ever since I adopted my new cat, the carpet on the inside of my bedroom door has been torn up day and night. She’s kept inside my room when I sleep, or when no one else is home, but aside from that, usually has free roam of the house.

At first, I thought it was the scratching post. Bought her a new post that she took to immediately, and loves to scratch. 

She kept scratching the carpet, so I got a horizontal scratching post that I fixed to the door. Came home to the post ripped off of the door and the carpet torn up to the floorboards. 

Sprayed a dose of feliway before I left, and came back to more shredded carpet. Sprayed about three doses, and still, more carpet that she’s torn up.

I caved and got one of the plastic mats that fix to the carpet, and it worked for about a week before she started tearing up the carpet around the border of the mat.

I’m sitting with her right now in my room, in front of my door, and she keeps hopping around my legs to tear at the carpet as if I’m not here.

I’m at my breaking point with her. I can’t leave her alone to go to class without worrying about how much carpet she’s ripping up while I’m gone. Her litter box is always clean before I leave, her water filled up, and her food fresh. I trim her nails on schedule so they don’t get too long. She has toys around my room to play with, and a nice scratching post I know she likes the feel of. 

I can’t cover my rental house in plastic, and I don’t know what else I can do.",beesbuzzingintensely,2022-11-14,03:51:35,2022,11,14,3,51,Monday

1,CatAdvice,Advice/Recommendations for Automatic Feeders?,"Hey everyone, 

I have one 4-year-old female cat. I have been looking into automatic feeders because of upcoming travel, and so I can establish a set routine for her. I feed her a small amount at a time, but more frequently because she has a problem with eating too fast, so I am hoping to find a feeder with small portions but more meal times to help with that. 

She has a more independent personality, so feeding and playtime are when I feel that I actually bond with her. The only thing I'm worried about with the automatic feeder is that she will lose that bond with me because I will no longer be the direct food source. 

I have researched a little about automatic, microchip, and smart feeders, and found some pretty good brands like PetLibro and Dogness. I am currently looking for something reliable, reasonably priced, and has a way of tracking meal times (like a log) so I can refer to them later. Any recommendations or advice for feeders, and your experience with them, would be helpful.

1,CatAdvice,"2yo cat seems to get sick of 6mo kitten, what do?","I am once again asking for your advice-shaped support!

Backstory: 

About a month ago I adopted Cookie Dough, a rescue kitten who is about 6 months old according to the vets. I already have a cat called Milkyway who is 2 years old. They're both female and spayed.

It took about a week for them to warm up to each other and Milky seemed to really enjoy Cookie's presence. I've had Milky since she was a few weeks old and safe for some visits elsewhere she has been an only child so far. So having a little playmate to actually play catch with was great for her. It was clearly playful, since they reversed roles a lot and never gave any signs of distress.

Cookie is clearly traumatized from her time as a stray and took (and is still taking) time to warm up to me. By now Cookie clearly adores both of us - she wants to be around us every waking and sleeping minute, napping on my legs and always coming over to see what Milky is up to.

Problem:

Milky seems to be starting to have regrets. She's withdrawing more from us, spending more time in my roommate's room (when she rarely left my side before). It doesn't help that when she comes over to ask for play or snuggles, Cookie wants to know what's up and engage with her. I see Milky rejecting Cookie more, smacking her away when she comes close and yesterday we even had a brief, tense staredown. I broke it up by redirecting their attention, but that spooked me.

I assume that the novelty has worn off and Milkyway wishes she could return to her old routine by now. I notice this in how she has picked some old behavior back up, like begging me for play even when Cookie is zooming in the background. Sometimes she approaches me and looks downright disappointed to see Cookie around.

Is this something I need to worry about? How can I make this easier for her? Do any of you have experience with this kind of reaction and can tell me how long it might last?

I miss my Milkybaby, especially when she stays away almost all day.

What I'm already trying:

I gently ward Cookie off when Milkyway comes to cuddle with me. It does not give her enough calm to continue for long though.

I check up on Milky sometimes, just seeking her out and asking her if she's okay. Petting her a little if she seems fine with it.

I try to engage both of them in play at the same time. For example, I throw something for Milkyway, then practice a trick with Cookie. When Milky comes back, I throw something for her again.

I try to make sure they never have to compete for resources, especially food and snacks. Both of them are pretty foodmotivated, so I do my best to always provide enough and distribute it enough that no tension arises.

And I've bought a pheromone diffuser that should be effective on the whole apartment. I already used those pheromones for the introduction and that seemed to help them.",Broeckchen89,2022-11-14,02:21:17,2022,11,14,2,21,Monday

1,CatAdvice,"Anxious new kitten owner, thinking about temporarily rehoming?","Hello! I’m 22F, and recently became the owner of a 12-week-old ragdoll kitten. 

I am not a first-time cat owner but technically I am since living on my own away from home! I live with my friend who also has some experience owning cats with her family. 

I did some research into the best cat breeds to keep indoors as we live in a city on a busy street, and recently purchased a 12-week-old rag doll girl kitten, she’s very well-behaved, purrs constantly and sleeps all day pretty much - but I worry that being indoors won’t be enough for her! She has bursts of energy where she tries to nibble plants and wires and scratch things but so far I have been around to redirect and distract her with toys - I just worry about when I’m not. I also worry the location of my flat is too noisy for her, although she seems ok. I live above a busy, noisy shop also, which might not be ideal. 

Our flat isn’t tiny but we don’t have a garden and will have to keep all the windows closed at all times in case she gets out. I’m not sure if it’s normal to feel this way but I’m incredibly anxious about leaving her alone, and just owning a cat in general.  

I work part-time, around 3-4 8-hour shifts a week and am also a student as is my flatmate. I did consider this before getting her but my flatmate and I both concluded there is almost always one of us at home within a 4-hour window at the very least. 

It is only day 3 now and I’ve only left her alone once for just under an hour - she seemed ok, but she was asleep. when she’s awake and I leave the room she cries, which worries me even more about leaving her alone! I’ve cat-proofed the flat as much as possible but I’m worried about things falling on her etc if she plays with them. I also plan on getting netting for the windows just in case. 

She has food and water out in the rooms she has access to (currently only my room and the living room/kitchen area), and a cat tree in the living room. When I go out I shut my bedroom door just to confine her to one area and minimise any potential damage! I hope this is ok? I’m not sure if this is irrational but we have one of those induction hob things that stays hot for a while after you use it and I’m worried about her jumping on it (she hasn’t yet even jumped on the counter), also jumping around and getting stuck somewhere she can’t get out and consuming plants she’s not supposed to, I’ve put them all up high and out of reach but I’m still paranoid. This was never a problem with my other cats so I’m not sure if I’m overthinking things! 

I’m not sure if I’ve taken on more than I can cope with or if these anxieties will ease over time. I’m terrified to actually go to work and leave her alone properly, I couldn’t relax at all just going to the shops! 

I do also feel slightly guilty about her having no access to the outside and no other cats to play with. The only reason I was able to purchase such a lovely cat was that I inherited just enough money from my grandmother passing away to invest in a cat, which I’ve wanted for a while, and she loved cats so it just felt right. However, I am stressing about not being a good enough home for her. I know it’s only been a few days but I haven’t really been able to relax, the first night I had her I didn’t really sleep because every time she would get up and walk around I’d bolt up to check on her. I’m being hyper-vigilant but I’m paranoid about accidentally leaving a window open, the stove on, a door open, a knife or something she shouldn’t eat on the counter etc. is this normal and if so, does the constant pet paranoia go away? 

I am fortunate enough to have the safety net of my mum, who is desperate to have her, we have had some pet and human losses over the past year that has affected us all, but especially my mum and she misses a small fluffy thing to cuddle, in her words. The cat they have now is much more aloof whereas this kitten never leaves my side and is much more of a lap cat, I know they’d love and mutually benefit from each other’s company. However, my dad isn’t so keen. They live somewhat near me but in a much safer area where she would have another cat to play with, access to the outside and a much larger indoor area too. My parents are also almost always home as they WFH, unlike me. My mum is ready to take her in a heartbeat but I would almost feel embarrassed and ashamed about taking on such a responsibility and not being able to handle it, but I also just want what’s best for the cat - which is what’s giving me such anxiety! In theory, I would plan to take her back when I am no longer a student and/or move to somewhere with a garden. 

I just worry I’ve bitten off more than I can chew. When I think about my parents temporarily (when I say temporary I mean a over a year, so she won’t be going back and forth much) adopting her it brings me a great sense of relief if I’m honest, and I’d see her frequently. I might be overthinking it all as it is early days and she is only 12 weeks so she’s bound to calm down a bit and it should get easier, but since I’ve had her in my care I have an almost constant sense of anxiety. Also just as a side note, another reason why I am even considering giving her to my parents is that my having a cat is that it pretty much eliminates the possibility of my boyfriend having his dog over to the flat that he shares with an ex, which is a shame. 
 
If you think this is a better alternative for her please let me know or if you have any kind words and advice it would be appreciated.",Whattheeffami,2022-11-14,01:35:25,2022,11,14,1,35,Monday

1,CatAdvice,How long does the weaning process usually last?,"My kitten is now 5-weeks old and I've taken her under my care ever since she was a newborn (her mother basically just abandoned her). Since last week (November 8), I started bottle-feeding her with both gruel and formula milk. I've tried training her to jump on her plate (hopefully to atleast smell the food) but she would just run around it. I also tried putting some of the wet food directly to her mouth to which she would try to taste and munch, but never on her own volition. Since it's been 5 days since her first taste of gruel, I tried putting the mix again on the plate in small amounts. She started licking some of it on her own, but not all. I tried placing the leftovers on her spoon and she would sloppily lick it, but then again, not all. So I guess, my question is, is our pacing normal? Or are we doing the weaning process too slowly? I'm scared of forcing her to feed because she might develop some aversion to her wet food if I do. Also, do you have other ideas or techniques that you could share to us?

As for the gruel mixture (the one on her bottle), I usually just mix 1/2 tbsp of her milk to 2 1/2 tbsp of water, then to 1 1/2 tbsp of wet food (Royal Canin Mother and Baby Cat starter food). As for the one on her plate, I usually mix 1.5L of her gruel and a small amount of wet food for thicker consistency (when I relied solely on her pre-made gruel mixture, she almost inhaled the milk so I was afraid to make the consistency thinner because she might aspirate).",perdufleur,2022-11-13,23:37:03,2022,11,13,23,37,Sunday
1,CatAdvice,My cat wont allow the new cat to use the litter box.,"Me and my partner recently got another cat a few weeks ago, the transition was actually good as it could be. We had another cat already a year old tabby male, ill refer to him as A who actually loves other cats and has his whole life. At his Foster moms house he has house mates he got along with. When i first got him, my roommate had a cat which he saw as his friend. When I got a new job in my home town and we had to move into my parents house he got along really well with my brothers cat. 

Now the same night we moved into our own place, we got out new kitty, she about 10 months old, ill refer to her and they transitioned well enough together. We have noticed at night that A likes to mess with P at night he might be older but in reality  he acts like a baby. Early this morning we heard P cry, she never cries and so my partner got up and we noticed A was hovering over P . Upon further inspection we noticed that P had used the floor instead of the litter box. My partner said that He had noticed even earlier that On top of the little box, but he didn’t see Her in it. Now we know she was and he was bugging her which led her to using the floor. We put A in one of the crates we have while my partner got ready for work and P was able to use the little box free of intrusion. 
We are unsure of what to do, they eat and drink out of the same bowls even at the same time and during the day.  He doesn’t bug her when she goes to use the little box during the day either but we don’t know how to stop it at night when we aren’t awake.

- any tips for resettling an indoor cat? (I know about creating a scent, bringing familiar smells inside and outside areas, keeping him in for a good few weeks to rehome)

- there is one other neutered male cat on the land (very nice boy but hasn’t met jetpack), how can I respect his home whilst integrating jetpack, or is it not my business?

I currently have one cat and one cat-friendly dog, and I’m making preparations to adopt another cat. I’m considering adopting from a Kuwaiti or Egyptian rescue, because the situation for cats is really bad in both places. I like the idea of meeting a cat before making the decision to adopt, but that’s not possible when adopting from oversees. My question is, how do you choose a cat to adopt when going off of limited information (a brief description and picture)? Is this all just too risky, and I should just stick with adopting a local cat? Personal experience welcome!",swamp_sparrow,2022-11-13,22:45:00,2022,11,13,22,45,Sunday

An elderly friend of mine moved to a new house a few years ago. In that time span, she started feeding the neighborhood cats. Long story short, there's a LOT of cats now (&gt;10) that she feeds and it's getting overwhelming. 

She loves the cats dearly and she wishes she could get them all spayed/neutered, but there's no way she could afford it for all of them. 

What are her options? Are there any low/no cost options to spay/neuter? Please be kind, we're both inexperienced with cats and pet care. Thanks.",jabby95,2022-11-13,22:40:28,2022,11,13,22,40,Sunday

1,CatAdvice,Black stuff on cat's tail...what could it be?,"Hi everyone,

My kitty is a white male domestic shorthair that I picked up from the shelter a few days ago. As we were cuddling today, I noticed some flecks of brown/black stuff on his tail (see photo [here](https://imgur.com/a/Ld1nWMx)) that looked sorta like dandruff. I did some googling but I'm having trouble identifying what it could be (all results point to stud tail, but I wanted to get some advice before taking action). He is an indoor cat and was told by the rescue that he didn't have any prior medical conditions. If anyone could lend a professional eye that would be really helpful. I am also yet to bathe him, so if anyone has any advice on recommended products, I would love to hear about them! Thanks so much :)",penguinmallow,2022-11-13,22:14:59,2022,11,13,22,14,Sunday
1,CatAdvice,adding a 3rd cat,My partner and I each have our own cat and the 2 cats haven’t gotten along since we’ve moved in together over a year ago. His cat is very energetic and will play nonstop and my cat only likes to nap and so any time they’re in the same room together all he wants to do is stalk and play fight her while she scurries away. They both do decently well with other animals I just think their personalities and energy levels don’t mesh well. Recently we’ve been considering getting another cat and our thought process is that if we get an energetic cat that can keep up with his cat they’ll play and leave my lazy cat alone.

I also read on the Internet several opinions on when it’s the best time to spay cats and I just need help. I don’t want them to make other kittens but also don’t want to harm them.

1,CatAdvice,My cat scratches the walls to the point that it's keeping us from sleeping,"When we got our 8 month old, spayed cat from a rescue about 4 months ago, she would cover up her food with her old kennel towel that we brought home for her. Eventually, that developed into a few scratches in the air over each side of her dish, eventually turning to one or two scratches on the rim of the bowl or nearby desk. We talked to one of the women from the rescue and she said that her cat did it too and that she was just being dramatic. We did a little search online and found that cats from shelters could have that behavior from having to share food. We thought it would eventually go away, and it wasn't hurting anything, so we let it go. Now it's gotten to the point where any time she eats or uses the bathroom, she sits on her back feet and uses both front paws to quickly and loudly scratch on any nearby walls nonstop for minutes on end. I'm not sure why she does it; it doesn't seem like the point is really to cover anything anymore. It feels like a compulsion. She does it and she does it until she feels like she's done it enough. But she does it very often and it's gotten so bad that it wakes us up every time and tends to keep us awake until she's finished, to the point where we often have a hard time finally going to sleep once she has finished. It's starting to really effect our sleep. We have one other cat, but he's not very competitive about food. In fact, he often steps back and waits for her to finish eating if she comes to eat while he's at the bowl. They get along very well. We have a new cat tree thing near their food that has scratching posts as every post, but they don't use it at all. She does have other things that she sharpens her claws on though, so I don't think that's the issue here. I'm not sure how to stop this behavior, largely because I don't know why she's doing it. I tried putting  wash cloths near the food dish in hopes that she would cover her food with them and be satisfied, but she hasn't touched them. Any ideas what this is about or how I can help her need to scratch this much?",KajeEmpowered,2022-11-13,17:05:47,2022,11,13,17,5,Sunday

1,CatAdvice,New cats keeps yowling,"I got a new cat today. She’s locked in my bathroom right now because I have other cats so I have to introduce slowly and all that jazz. Anyways, she is yowling when I leave the room, and I know it’s because she’s scared, but I’m not entirely sure what to do. I can’t keep her in my room for the night because my other cats like my room and when I did put her in my room, she kept growling and hissing. Also, my other cats just sit at my bedroom door when it’s closed, which stresses all the cats out.
Any and all advice welcome. Also, sorry if this isn’t written super well, it’s the middle of the night for me. I’ve been sitting with her but I can’t stay in the bathroom forever.
I feel like she probably is yowling because she wants out? But obviously I can’t let her out because my other cats would flip and I can’t lock my other cats up for the night.
Also, she’s 4 years old, if that matters. Family friend couldn’t keep her so I offered to take her in. My other 2 cats are both a year old.

1,CatAdvice,What else can I do for my cat to give her a better life?,"Lately, I feel like my cat has been bored. She kind of just wanders around aimlessly or sleeps more than usual. I do work nightshift 12 hour shifts so I am gone an extended period of time, and when I get home, I sleep an extended period of time. 

She has her own bedroom with:

• a TV (i play birds or a string game she likes on it) 

• 3 cat towers (one infront of a window)
• a puzzle toy

• scattered small toys

• a door hanging mouse on a string she can jump and play with

• a crinkle tunnel 

• a ripple rug she can jump in and out of and play in

• a 3 tier corrugated cardboard house 

• one of those 3 tier ball towers they hit the ball around 

In my room she has: 

• an old iPad that plays little games on it 24/7 she can play with

• a cat tower infront of another window

•little small mouse toys and ball toys

• an interactive toy that’s like a whack a mole kind of thing 

In the living room she has a scratcher toy, another 3 tier ball tower toy and another cat tree in front of a big bay window. 

And in the kitchen she has another cat tree in front of another big window. 

But she still seems to be bored and most of the time just lays on the floor. She has been wanting to outside and meows at the door but I do not want to go out there with her because she refuses to let me put on her harness. I do have a pet stroller for her we can take a walk in, so we did that tonight. But then we get inside and it’s the same thing. 

Does anyone have any more tips of what I could do to help make her life better or her not be so bored?? Everything I’ve found on Google to do she either already has or is not interested in. 

Also, she does not like other animals and is a very high strung cat so I don’t think getting her a friend would help.",njb6126,2022-11-13,14:47:18,2022,11,13,14,47,Sunday
1,CatAdvice,Cat stressed/angry/hates new puppy,"I am feeling pretty down. We got a new puppy 7 weeks ago. We have 3 cats and 2 other dogs. My one cat (Scratch), who is my favorite just absolutely hates the puppy. It has gotten worse over time, not better but the puppy has gotten more confident and rowdy. She is still learning to respect the cats. The other 2 cats are fairly tolerant of her, one sets good boundaries, the other is a marshmallow.  I am trying to give my cat treats when the puppy is around to have positive associations and he is very food motivated. Scratch is very smart and I think is probably creating more anxiety because of it. Now my cat has started hating me as well. I haven't changed anything and have been giving him special treats but he is running behind the furnace and hiding. He will come out to eat from my hand and run straight back to hide. He growled and hissed at me. The puppy was not around or even making noise in the house. He also pretty much has the basement as a safe space away from the puppy. I am wondering if I need to force him to spend more time in the same room as the puppy. This is really getting to me and I need solutions. I have started Scratch on CBD but I honestly think he is worse. I wouldn't have gotten a puppy if I knew it would be this bad but we have her now.

1,CatAdvice,Cats disturb neighbors ar night by litter box scratching,"Hey guys, 
I could really use some advice from you since I am at my wits' end.

I have two female cats (both 12 years old) and have been living in the same ground floor apartment for 3 years. For about two months or so though, I've noticed that my neighbors next door have  been complaining to each other (not to me yet) about the cats scratching around in the litter box at night.

The walls are paper-thin; I can hear my upstairs neighbors coughing, walking, when they talk in a normal voice etc. and hear the elevator going up and down outside my apartment door for reference.

Since they have an open tray, I've tried switching to a closed box with a swinging door three weeks ago, but they haven't used it yet, even with the door and lid removed. I put a rug underneath the tray and put some fabric on the sides to try and reduce the noise, but the changes are minimal because the cats usually don't scratch the edge but the actual litter.
I empty the clumps at least twice a day and always before night and regularly change the litter, so it shouldn't be due to an unclean litter box.

Unfortunately, I am a heavy sleeper and oftentimes (if even) only wake up right after they finished or when I hear my neighbors complain. The times I do notice them scratching (my guess is it's about 1-2 mins at a time, around twice a night), I call the cats so that they come to me and pet them to try and reinforce a shorter scratching time, but the damage is usually already done. I'm also worried that they will get the wrong idea and stop using the tray.

The litter tray is in the bathroom and the door is unlocked but not open so that the cats can go in and out. Obviously, I can't block access to the tray at night as they need to use it, but I also don't want to be evicted from the apartment due to noise pollution, as there is a ""quiet time"" from 10pm to 6pm. 

I have tried to eliminate all other noise sources and started covering the scratching posts at night and leave out food for the night so that they don't meow. They are seniors and almost never run around at night. But I just don't know how to combat this problem and the neighbors seem to get more and more agitated and I am really sceade that they will complain to the landlord if they haven't already. I understand my neighbors, but I haven't found a way to fix this yet.

1,CatAdvice,Cat Resource Guarding Anything Soft,"Archer (1 y/o neutered male) has recently (within the past few months) started resource guarding anything soft or fluffy - this includes cat toys, dog toys, socks, underwear, etc. We have 3 small dogs and another cat (1 y/o spayed female), and none of them have ever exhibited any resource guarding behaviors; and this is the first time I’ve ever seen a cat do it at all. 

He crouches over the object and growls and hisses even if no one else is near him. With some difficulty, my husband and I immediately take the items away from him so no one else gets hurt. To make matters worse, he has started to dip the items in water until they’re soaking wet - almost as if he is trying to drown it? Archer and Hazel are my first two cats as an adult, and I’m not sure what to do about his behavior. He’s a perfect cat otherwise and is very loving and smart. I do my best to hide objects he may do it with, but it is extremely difficult with the dogs since I don’t want to take away all their toys.

1,CatAdvice,Where do I leave my cat?,"So next year I’m going on a trip for almost 4 weeks. I currently live with my parents but I do my thing, they do theirs. They tolerate my cat and when I’m not around I have to lock him in my room (I’m rarely gone long hours as I work and study from home so it’s never been an issue).

So, if I go on this trip, I can either:
A) Leave my cat at home, where he is familiar, and my parents are willing to feed him/clean his litter box but he stays in my room most time and isolated :(

B) Leave him with a friend in an environment he has never been in, possibly with other pets but has more freedom to roam and potentially play (he hates other cats though)

C) Leave him in a boarding house/pet hotel (which I find very sketchy honestly, I’m not into this option at all and I assume ya’ll wont too).

I can’t bring him with me because it’s a backpacking trip. We’ll be constantly moving. Any advice and ideas would be appreciated. I’m just thinking ahead this trip is more than a whole year away.",need2feelbetter,2022-11-13,10:45:09,2022,11,13,10,45,Sunday

1,CatAdvice,What do I do about my overly energetic cat who is bullying the others?,"I live in a house with 3 cats (Olivia, Bobbit and Dale) and Bobbit is causing a lot of trouble and stress for the other cats and me. He is very pushy when demanding attention and often scares off Olivia when I give her attention. He has always been quite friendly and fine with people but is often quite aggressive when ""playing"" with Olivia. She has no interest in playing with him and, since she is quite small, has no real way to defend herself. Every now and then he will chase her and pounce. She really hates this, screaming and scaring everyone. It sounds awful but I don't think that he has ever actually hurt her, no blood or anything.

I am always on edge when he starts following her or I hear him running. We moved house a few months ago and I was hoping the more busy living arrangements would mellow him out a bit but he hasn't changed and even started bullying Dale, who is about 50% bigger but a huge softy. I don't know if it is under-stimulation but he gets more attention than the others so I'm not sure.

Feel free to ask for clarification, I'm not great at explaining these things.

The cats don't play together, that's a time Bandit will bully her out of playing. I have figured out how Bandit loves to play.

Feathers and tissue paper will get her going but she stops after about a minute and seems uninterested, not even looking at the toy.

1,CatAdvice,How do I get my cat use to being alone while I am at work?,"So, two years ago at the start of the pandemic - I adopted a cat from an animal shelter. Since the last two years, my cat has been so use to having both my mom and myself in the house and working from home. Now both our jobs wants us back physically next week. I am not sure how to get my cat use to be alone as when either of us going out (shopping, visiting, etc.,) from my pet surveillance camera I've seen my cat having tantrums - he will let out this LOUD crying-like meow for hours until we come home. And if one of us leaves while the other stays home with him, he will still get very upset and will not calm down until we come home.",zingular1232,2022-11-13,08:50:46,2022,11,13,8,50,Sunday
1,CatAdvice,My cat has now developed this habit where eating his snackies (and only those) has now become a two person activity. Which is essentially a problem of my own creation,"So this is really, really ridiculous, but now that I’ve gotten him into this, I don’t know how to get him out of it. He, like most cats, really likes his snackies. However, him eating them and getting his full enjoyment out of it started as him liking it when I watch him eat. His name is ButtButt, he’s 8 years old,  I’ve had him for 7 years, and he likes me to tell him what a good EaterButt he is when he’s eating. 

However, this has now evolved to him only eating his snackies while I’m bent way over, reaching under his undercarriage and rubbing his front armpits/chest and upper tummy while I both talk to him the entire time and/or sing to him while I do said undercarriage rubbing. 

As soon as I stop and start walking away then he’ll stop eating and wander away. So just to be clear, it’s only with his snackies, my participation is not necessary during him eating anything else and he’s definitely not underfed, he’s got a little bit of chonk on him. 

How do I break it to my cat that him eating and enjoying his snackies does not need to be a two person event? Or should I just resign myself to my fate that from here on out I’m going to have to rub my cats armpits and sing to him in order for him to get his full enjoyment out of his snackies?",Majestic_Jazz_Hands,2022-11-13,08:50:09,2022,11,13,8,50,Sunday
1,CatAdvice,How to play better with my cat?,"I adopted my cat about a year and a half ago. I'm not sure of her exact age but the vet estimated around 8. She is beautiful, sweet and affectionate a lot of the time but she is also a bit aggressive. If I walk past her too often when she is in the hallway or on the couch she will swipe at me. She also occasionally chases me around the house and playfully bites and swipes my legs. I don't think either of these things are actual aggression, I suspect she may need more play. The trouble I'm having is that she seems to get bored quickly when I play with her. I use a laser toy to get her very excited then I switch to a piece of string on a stick which she loves. I try to make her run as much as possible and climb as much as possible during the play sessions but she gets bored quite quickly. I have tried to use different toys with her but she is only interested in the laser and the string. I tried to tie a bird toy to the string but she wasn't interested. I would like for her to be able to properly bite and kick and ""kill"" what she ""hunts"" when we play but she can't do that with the laser or the string really. We also sometimes play hide and seek where I hide and poke my head out to let her see me then she runs to me and catches me (doesnt swipe or bite me during this). She enjoys this but my house is small so she gets bored quickly with this too. 


She's an indoor only cat, she can look out windows all day and I leave the back door open so she can look into the garden while I'm home, when I go to work and when I sleep I leave puzzle feeders out for her. I'm not sure what else I can do to give her more stimulation and play with her better to hopefully reduce her swiping and chasing me.

1,CatAdvice,cat meows less after i got a kitten?,"hi! so i have a 2.5 year old neutered male cat named kiwi who i’ve had for 1.5 years now. he came from a not so nice home and has a lot of anxiety around strangers but once he warms up, is very sweet and loves pets. he also is notoriously SUPER vocal, meowing all the time and having whole conversations with me especially in the morning (nothing concerning just talks a lot).

i recently (3 weeks ago) made the decision to get a kitten for a variety of reasons, two of them being so that kiwi can have a playmate and some company since he’s very playful, and also in the hopes that having a more sociable cat around might help his anxiety a bit in the long run.

new kitten’s name is fig, also male and about 12 weeks old now. it’s actually been going really well between them, they play all the time, sleep near each other (haven’t cuddled yet but i think that’s not necessarily a red flag), kiwi will also groom fig which usually turns into more playing. basically it feels like things are going great!

the only thing is that kiwi is wayyy less vocal with me than he used to be. he still meows at me from time to time and makes a lot of smaller meows and trilling noises with fig but it’s nowhere near as much as it was before. i’m not really seeing any other behavioral changes and he seems to enjoy fig’s presence and i show him plenty of affection so he doesn’t get jealous. i have a theory that maybe some of his meowing from before was out of loneliness and so less meowing now is actually a good thing, but the paranoid cat mom in me just wants some other opinions!

1,CatAdvice,two cats + new kitten = ????,"hey there, my partner and i have added a new kitten into my little family. he is 3 months old, with only 3 feet, so we named him Yardstick. we expected our current cats, Eggy (3) and Miso (1) , to need time to adapt, but it’s been very strange thus far. 

Miso and Egg have been hissing at each other. obviously the baby, which was expected, but they’ve been very angry with each other too. i can’t quite figure out why, and it’s bothering me as they have been very close since Miso was young.

in addition, they get upset if they even hear the baby, so keeping him out of sight doesnt even really help. we moved him out of the bathroom (because he has a URI and is so miserable that he cries all the time), and into a covered playpen into the living room to hopefully fix this problem. Eggy adapted to him being there rather quickly, but he and Miso are still fighting each other.

1,CatAdvice,13hr Drive to High Elevation,"Hi everyone! I'd really appreciate any advice on this. 

My cat is 5 years old, active, and fairly anxious. He frequently does 4hr drives with me in his crate. I usually give him gabapentin the night before and morning of. He loves his crate but cries when it's closed.

Next week I'm doing a 13hr drive in one day to the top of the rocky mountains from basically sea level. I'm already worried about how he'll react to the elevation change. Logistically and financially, my best option is to take him even though I wish I didn't have to.

The vet tech recommended I let him roam in the cab and gave me tips to practice with him. I'm in the car with him now, parked. He stopped crying when I opened his crate. He looked around a bit but has been in his crate mostly. I've always been nervous about him being out in the car. Do the safety concerns outweigh his and my sanity? 

He can't wear a collar because his hair tangles horribly. I'm trying to train him on a harness and leash but he's not taking to it very well. Any tips to getting him comfortable wearing it?

1,CatAdvice,Cat is randomly very aggressive for seemingly no reason.,"My cat (neutered male) attacks me randomly.

It happens once week on average. It’s like a total personality switch, and he really seems like he wants to hurt me (and usually partially succeeds). I have to lock him in another room for at least 10 minutes and then it’s like nothing ever happened. 

He’s about 6 years old now and doesn’t typically like to play or cuddle. I got him from Craigslist when he was maybe 8 weeks old from a family with a young child. They originally got the kitten as a Christmas gift for the kid. 

Anyways. I love my cat. But it’s getting bad and to the point that I’ve started considering rehoming/ looking into barn cat programs.

1,CatAdvice,My healthy 18 year old cat still won’t stop pooping outside litter box after recovering from a urinary blockage.,"So, about 2 months ago, I took my old cat to the vet for him pooping outside the litter box. He ended up having a urinary blockage and was really sick, but he has since recovered and has been really healthy. My parents and I figured this was the cause of maybe why he has been pooping out of the box, but now that he’s perfectly healthy, he still keeps doing it, no matter what. Our carpet is completely destroyed.

We’ve tried many things. Getting a new litter box. Using pet repellent. Blocking off the area where he poops on the carpet but that also didn’t work. Moving his litter box to the place he poops. I even picked up his poop and placed it in the litter box to see if that would work by redirecting the scent, but of course, that didn’t work.

This one vet recommended pheromones, but I don’t wanna waste money because I feel like it’s a bunch of bullshit if the other things didn’t work. I’m running out of options at this point, and I love my family cat, but our basement is completely destroyed and smells like shit, and they’re more fed up than I am and my parents have made me the “executive poop picker upper.” I have to pick up multiple piles of a poop every other day, and I don’t know how long this is going to go on for. 

I’m assuming it’s feline dementia since the urinary blockage thing has been resolved given he’s super healthy otherwise now for his age.

Where do I go from here? Let him keep pooping how he has been until he dies? I don’t want him to die, and i think he has a few more years in him given his condition and energy. But my parents and I suspect he may be peeing outside the litter box, but I can’t smell anything nor can my parents.

Just for inventory, Cletus has three scratch pads horizontal, and three that are vertical. He has one of those dish games that have the ball stuck in it so he can wack it around in a circle, a cat tower looking out a window. Two windows that have furniture underneath so he can look out those too. We play one-on-one with fetch (nurf bullets of all things hehe) for about an hour a day (I haven't found any other one-on-one activities he likes ) and he likes to play with pencils (just wacking them around not biting)

The thing is, my house is small, and when he gets the zooms, the man he is on it haha. He is running up the walls (there are scratch marks, and I'm worried il have to paint the whole house due to it being a rental) He is jumping on counters and knocking things over, including his feeding dish. I have a dog so I put Cletus' food on the table so he can eat it without worrying about Cassie ( my dog) eating it but now he is batting it on the ground. 

I think he is bored because he is jumping on surfaces and breaking a lot of things, but this is always when I'm at work ( so not sure if he is bored or just curious and clumsy). I've put double-sided sticky tape on all door frames to deter scratching which has worked....but I'm scared it will ruin my furniture if I put it on there. 

What can I do to entertain him to get his energy out? I work full-time and don't know what to do when I'm not here. Please help!!! I'm getting overwhelmed and have no idea what to do. Will he calm down, or will these be his permanent energy needs (he's an orange domestic short hair).

1,CatAdvice,"Cat introduction 2nd month in, wondering if certain behaviors are expected and will go away? Might just need moral support","Hi everyone!
I have had my resident cat (10yr female) for about 2 years, she was fostered with several other cats when we adopted her, so has lived with cats before but it has been 2 years since then.
2 months ago we made the decision to adopt another cat (2ish yr  male). He has also lived with other cats before and no concerns with him.


So we brought him home and to my knowledge we followed Jackson Galaxy to a T. Scent swapped, site swapped, other side of the door feeding until they were consistently eating beside each other no hissing. Moved on to eat, play, love. We know we've got a bit of an age and energy gap so we play with the new cat, and resident cat (and she gets lots of pets when she's loafing, same as before). We also play/treat both in new cat's basecamp and rest of the house to balance out territorial business.


Here's where I'm not sure if it's going wrong and if anyone has experience with something similar. They're fine 80% of the time, sleeping in the same room, passing in hallways, scrambling with zoomies past the other. Then every so often my resident cat just gets weird. She'll find an ambush spot on the stairs or something and go to chase/swat the new cat (doesn't look playful, her eyes will be dilated and ears back). Sometimes she'll be rolling over onto her back, in front of the new cat, and slow blinking at him, and then she'll randomly flip her top and chase/swat him away when it doesn't look like he's even moved or there's been some other noise to startle her. 


So Reddit, what do you think? Does this kind of behavior mellow out? Have we moved too fast somewhere along Jackson galaxy's advice? Do we keep doing what we're doing?


Other info:
- Resident cat had her yearly vet visit a couple weeks ago and clean bill of health
- haven't had any litterbox issues
- still separated overnight
- when I talk about the behaviour mellowing out I'd like to clarify that when we see my resident cat setting up an ambush we redirect her and try to get her playing and keep the new cat occupied away from ambush zone
- we have Feliway multicat diffusers for good measure",goosey_goosen,2022-11-13,03:00:03,2022,11,13,3,0,Sunday
1,CatAdvice,Should I leave my cat at home with people stopping by every now and then or should I have him stay at a friend’s house?,"I’m going away to my parents’ for most of December and can’t bring my cat with me (traveling and border regulations). I’ve only ever left him one time for about two weeks and had a friend come over and she would hang out at my apartment most days. 

He’s a very social cat. He follows me around more often than not. Meows very loudly every time I (or my neighbors) come home. Even when I step out to pick up a package for less than a minute. 

I’m worried that he’ll feel too lonely if my friends can only stop by to feed him and clean his litter. I don’t think they’d be able to spend much time with him consistently every day. 

I have a friend who lives a bit far from me who said he could take him in. I haven’t been to his place yet though, so I’m not sure what the environment looks like. He has one roommate. He’s one of the few who will be around for the holidays. I feel like I’d need to see his place first. I’d probably also have to bring over some of my cat’s things (on top of food, water fountain, litter box, etc.) so he feels comfortable. I think this would be a good option so my cat is surrounded by people most of the time, but I know how cats hate changing environments. Plus if he stays at my place, I can keep an eye on him with the pet cams I have set up. 

I don’t know what the best option is. I’ll be gone for almost 5 weeks. Would it be better to have my cat stay home and have someone stop by once in a while or bring him over to my friend’s house?",josie_96,2022-11-13,02:46:16,2022,11,13,2,46,Sunday

I got back from the vet and they gave my kitten fluids and said she has a 104 fever. They said to monitor her but doesn’t seem to be concerned about anything critical happening..

Am I overthinking it or do you think the kitten will be fine?

1,CatAdvice,Cat not using litter box,"I have 3 cats, one ~12 years and a brother/sister that are about 2. When we got the two younger ones we initially had their food and litter upstairs in our bedroom and throughout several moves had it on the main floor, in the main floor bathroom and finally in the basement. 

The female kitten has always had issues with peeing in the litter box. When we first got them she liked using my wife's side of the bed. Now she is using one spot on the main floor and the main floor bathroom, and frequently goes right in front of the litter boxes. The main floor has wooden floors and the basement laminate flooring. 

We have tried everything we could find t clean her spots, and try to keep the boxes clean but we cannot seem to get her to use the box for urinating.  I am planning on a vet visit just to check her out and make sure she's healthy but is there any other advice anyone has?  Our daughter is on the verge of crawling and we really cant have this problem when she turns mobile and my wife wants to re-home the kitten if we can't resolve by that time.

We prepared everything before the adoption, we went shopping for toys, blankets, and everything else a kitten needs to feel confortable in our house. As we expected him to be afraid of us, the first day we weren't surprised to find him hidding under the bed all day allong. The thing is that a day and a night has pass, and he is still hidding there. He didn't even touch his bowl of food. I'm really concerned about his health and his well being. What should we do ?

1,CatAdvice,Menace with her Water Bowl,"A few months ago my cat started to tip her water bowl over and paw at her water to make it fall out. I posted here and the advice was to get a water fountain. Well, she treated the water fountain as a water park, playing in the water and getting both her and the carpet soaked (i live in a carpeted apartment). We got a mat under the fountain but she flicked the water beyond the mat. After two weeks maybe we took the motor out of the fountain and used it as just a big water bowl instead, hoping that it was big enough for her to not tip over. That worked fine for a while, but more recently she has started to dip her paws in the water and play with the water anyway. I tried to counteract that by putting less water in, but that just enabled her to flip the bowl over and make a bigger mess. Plus she was scratching on the mat a bunch and accidentally tipping the water over then too. This morning, she bit the mat and dragged it and the water bowl across the room, flipping all of the water out.

1,CatAdvice,Overnight stay for neuter?,"Hi!
My baby is almost 5 months old and approaching his neuter appointment. His vet is an cat only clinic and has mentioned that they normally keep cats overnight after being neutered to make sure they don’t jump for the first 24 hours, etc. She told me there was no way I would be able to prevent this at home, which may be true, but I had planned to stay home with him for the first few days afterwards so that I can keep an eye in him. I could also get a crate for him to stay in the first night because I assume that is what they would do there. I’m extremely nervous about him staying overnight because he gets so anxious at the vet that he freezes up and trembles when I have to set him down. I don’t want to be pushy with the vet about him coming home that same day because obviously she’s the professional but at the same time I feel like he’d be more comfortable at home and that I could make sure he didn’t do anything to injure himself. Anyone ever been in a similar situation before? Did you push back? If your cat did have to stay overnight, were they okay anxiety wise once you got them back home? I probably sound insane lol but I just really don’t see why he would need to stay as long as he handles the surgery/anesthesia/etc. okay so curious what other people think.",Disastrous-veggie,2022-11-12,23:31:14,2022,11,12,23,31,Saturday
1,CatAdvice,How do I get my cat to sleep through the night/leave me alone?,"my cat is about a year and a half old and has consistently woken me up in the middle of the night since she was a kitten. i lived at home with my parents for a few months and their cat (which didn’t like mine very much lol) kept her distracted-ish at night. i’m back on my own and she consistently wakes me and my partner up from 5-8am almost every day. recently she’s started climbing up on my nightstand to knock stuff over or chew on wires. she shouldn’t be bored — she has toys and tunnels and scratching posts and cat trees — i know she probably just wants attention but my lack of sleep is causing problems in my life!!

it feels like i have tried everything! i’ve tried:

- playing with her before bed to wear her out (didn’t work)

- changing feeding times and making sure she has food in the morning

- locking her out of the bedroom (she just scratches at the door nonstop, and i think scratched the paint off in some places — i’m in a rental so i can’t wait long enough for her to stop)

- wearing earplugs 

- cat pheromone diffuser (stopped working after the first refill) 

- other stuff im probably too tired to remember

i’m sure the solution here is to get another cat, but that’s not financially feasible right now. i love my cat, she’s the light of my life, but i am at my wit’s end trying to get her to sleep though the night, or at least stop waking me up. i know cats are most active at dusk and dawn, but changing her rhythm hasn’t helped. what do i do?",sarabera263,2022-11-12,23:14:09,2022,11,12,23,14,Saturday

His toys are in different shapes, sizes and looks. I also have different rod toys in shapes of mouses, balls, feathers to yarn. He shows no interest and will look at me weirdly when I try to interact with him during his active time. 

He only meows and want to go out started after he felt better but I’m ignoring it and I know that outdoor cats will need time to get use being an indoor cat.

1,CatAdvice,"Two cats, two people, one room","Hi everyone. So I have a bit of a dilemma, or I guess more so just a situation I’d like some advice on and help in working out some potential road bumps. My (22f) boyfriend (23m) of five years and I have been renting apartments together for about three and a half years. In that time we have managed to accumulate two wonderful cats, and similar to all of you, I love them so incredibly much. 
We currently live in a city where rent is extremely high, and honestly it can be kind of hard sometimes. I’d say we’re living just slightly above paycheck to paycheck. 

Anyways, my grandparents, who currently live on the farm they raised me on, have generously invited the four of us to come and stay with them and help them around the property for a few years while saving up money to potentially buy our own house. As I’m sure you can imagine if you’ve ever been poor, this sounds fucking awesome. My grandparents would not be charging us rent, just things like helping with groceries and electricity. 
However, I’m concerned for my cats. Firstly, my grandparents have an utterly massive Labrador named Jack. I’m talking 140 pounds. He’s nice, but cats are small, and even accidentally he could potentially kill them. He mainly stays downstairs, but I can’t guarantee always. Not to mention the onslaught of wildlife outdoors in the rural area that would make them into lunch. 
One of my cats, Pumpkin, is about 8 years old and would have no issue staying in what would become our bedroom (which is pretty large). But my younger girl, Mochi, can sometimes be a bit adventurous, and I honestly just feel completely petrified at the idea of her somehow getting out and coming face to face with Jack (who again, isn’t violent, just a unit), or God forbid getting outside. 

This would be a life changing opportunity, and if we could stick it out a year or two and save our incomes we could likely get together a down payment for a house. But nothing is really more important to me right now than my cats well-being. 

Could I make them happy living in that one room? Could I effectively keep them in there, safe? Does this seem ridiculous? 
I’m sorry this is so long, I’m just trying to really fill in the details. Does anyone have any advice? I’m feeling so conflicted. 

I have some ideas. Like making the closet into an area just for them, cat shelves, tall trees for them, baby gate at the door, self cleaning litter box to keep the small area clean… but would it be enough? Any help would be amazing.",chl666e,2022-11-12,16:13:52,2022,11,12,16,13,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,"Cats coexist most of the time but fight at morning and bedtime, how to make it stop??","Several months ago I introduced a new cat (F) into the household that was very cat reactive. I won’t use the word aggressive because she reacts out of fear and up until very recently she didn’t seem to want to start fights, just avoid them. She was very suspicious of my previous two cats (M + F) and growled and hissed anytime she would see them for weeks, but we slowly got to a place that they coexisted.  


We’re now at a place where they coexist a majority of the time. She’s even starting to sleep near the male who is more tolerant of her. The other female wants nothing to do with her. It feels like she “burned a bridge” and now she won’t let her redeem herself. She growls when she gets too close or seems too interested in her. They won’t sniff each other or greet each other, even though they would in the past.  


Now at bedtime when we settle down, and in the morning just before we usually wake, the new cat will chase the female through the house until she’s trapped her under the nightstand. They’ll both growl and not stop unless we separate them. It doesn’t escalate beyond growling, but the initial chase is super stressful to her. She doesn’t do this at all during the day, or through the middle of the night.  


I’ve tried immediately putting the new cat in time out for 5-10 minutes in a crate each time this happens, and it seemed like it was working for a couple weeks, but now they’re back at it again.",PigeonsInSpaaaaace,2022-11-12,15:38:59,2022,11,12,15,38,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,How much should I feed my first cat?,"Hi!

I’m a new cat owner. I adopted a 3y old black male cat who weights around 12.5lbs and is fairly long about a month ago. The foster parent I got him from was feeding him two 3oz servings of fancy feast tuna and about 1 cup of kibble. 

I’ve kept up the portions but I’ve switched his wet food to the wellness brand. He had some loose stools on fancy feast so I figured it wasn’t the best option for him.

I feed him two 3oz wellness chicken herring meals—the first around 11am and the second around 7pm. I then have an auto feeder that feeds him a little less than 1/4 cup of kibble at 9am, 2:30pm, 9pm, and 12am. He seems like he is a healthy weight but I want to make sure that I’m neither over feeding him nor under feeding him. As a side note, he’s fairly active and plays with his toys twice a day for a good 10 minutes. He also uses his water fountain throughout the day. Lastly, he will not finish kibble if he’s full, so he grazes on it rather than finishes the entire thing if he’s not that hungry.

Any advice is appreciated!",Victoire48,2022-11-12,13:42:17,2022,11,12,13,42,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,Newly developed “clinginess” She won’t let me sleep,"Hi all! Recently my cat has developed some behavioral changes that is concerning me. She is generally fine in the day, I play with her and she sleeps like normal. But at night shortly after I fall asleep she has started to lightly scratch me or scream in my face to wake me up. This will continue the entire night, I haven’t been able to sleep because of it. 

Some changes in our lives (that I don’t know is necessarily relevant): she has been sick for quite some time. She started coughing two years ago and every time I brought it up to the vet she dismissed it. The first time my partner brought her in, they finally did tests and found out she has a lung condition, as well as asthma. She has been on steroids for about a week now and she has stopped coughing. For me, I got Covid 3 months ago which triggered insulin resistance and my blood sugar stayed above 300 for a while (even when fasting). At that time both of my cats were attentive and I knew the reason why. Now my sugars are under control and things went back to normal. The only other thing is the fact that I’m on antibiotics because one of them scratched me and caused an abscess that I had drained the day this all started. (Again I don’t know if this is relevant but cats can sense a lot of things.) 

Other than that, nothing has really changed in our lives. My partner travels for work which started almost 3 years ago, but she wasn’t really phased by it. The only thing I can think is there is something wrong with me or her. Or she’s just becoming anxious. I don’t know. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",AutumnFG,2022-11-12,13:28:44,2022,11,12,13,28,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,help?,"
Recently my wife and I had to move back in with family. We have 4 cats all ages 6-2. We thankfully had found someone to foster them long term until we were able to move back out, unfortunately today our foster told us that they no longer foster our cats so in now we're weighing our options. 

Now on to the main point, my thoughts were to build a cation type enclosure for our 4 cats in our families back yard (they don't want them in the house). All 4 of them have been indoor cats their whole lives and have almost no experience being outdoors. To keep them safe I felt like an enclosure with little individual houses/boxes would work. 

My wife's worry is that since it's starting to get colder as winter gets closer that they'll get too cold. 

Just hoping for some ideas or insight. It's not very likely that we'll be able to find another long term foster for them, even if they're split up. Thank you!",halfchunkles,2022-11-12,12:58:13,2022,11,12,12,58,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,Is it normal for my newly adopted kitten to need nearly constant attention? I am a first-time cat owner.,"This week I adopted a 4-month-old female Siamese-mix kitten from a veterinarian in a small midwestern town. Before picking her up, she was already spayed, vaccinated, litter trained, and is very well-socialized and outgoing. She’s amazing and everything I’ve ever dreamed of.

However, she demands my near-constant attention. It’s to the point where she cannot sleep unless I am next to her, and she will even wake up and follow me if I walk away from her while she’s sleeping. And she struggles to play independently, amongst other things. I spend several hours daily playing with her. I work from home, so I need to be able to get a few hours of work done. 

Is this separation anxiety? She was rescued from a parking lot when she was only a few days old, and was nursed to health for several weeks by veterinarians for a long time—so maybe she’s used to constantly being held and touched? 

Can anyone recommend any cat toys that she can play with independently? Any music/sounds I can play to relax her so she can sleep deeply alone? Any advice in general? 

Thank you in advance.",BaptismPiracy,2022-11-12,12:45:58,2022,11,12,12,45,Saturday
1,CatAdvice,Cat help with a hyperactive cat boi that use to be a stray,"So me and hubby saved a cat from getting ran over a few months ago (I mean this dummy of a kitten was literally running TOWARDS oncoming traffic)and at first he was very distant and scared of us but now he's more comfortable with being around us and even let's us pick him up (sometimes). We do have a few problems tho. For starters we can't decide on what the best food for him is (both dry &amp; wet), we also don't know how often to feed him, at the moment we usually feed him whenever one of us first wakes up, then we either take food away and give it back to him after a couple of hours at a time or we leave it out for him all day and by the middle of the day he's eaten all of it and is hungry again. Another issue were having is training him to not bite/scratch us when we pet/play with him, it's getting a little too annoying/painful to even try to play with him ourselves because he sees our hands and feet as toys...which use to be cute, but now it just hurts. Another issue is that hubby has 2 pet birds that are always in their cage, but ever since we brought our fur baby home, he had tried to get to the birds at every opportunity, it was so bad that we ended up having to move the birds to the high ground so that he can't reach them. Another issue is that whenever we try to eat some food out in the open, he'll try his damnest to sniff, lick, and/or straight up walk on our food, which is cute, until you remember where his mouth has been so you don't want him anywhere near something that you are about to consume. Our current solution to this is locking him in the Landry room until we're done eating (we're not proud of this, but it's the only way that we can eat in peace). How do you guys have the patience with your cats after they’ve bittenand/or scratched you for the umpteenth time in a single day? And last but not least...is him being a hyperactive kitten. Now we're not TOO concerned about this because we know that he's a kitten and that he just wants to play, we usually just play with him for a few minutes to tire him out, then he becomes The lazy fuck that most cats are. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated. Also sorry for the borderline trauma dump😅",AlwaysHungry626,2022-11-12,12:31:32,2022,11,12,12,31,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,My cat has started biting when he's on my desk.,"Hi, I got a 5-7 year old cat a month ago. He was a street cat before the shelter took him in, but likely had an owner before that because he was extremely cuddly off the bat. Problem is, in the last couple weeks, he has started biting me. At first I thought it was love bites, but I'm pretty sure he has become territorial of my desk. He almost exclusively tries to bite when he's on my mousepad and I put my hands near the mouse or near him, even to pet him. Obviously this makes it very hard to work, and nothing I've tried will make him stop. I'm trying to avoid anything physical or fear based, and all I've done when he bites so far is stopped petting him, walked away, told him no, or physically removed him from the desk. None of this has worked. I read that this may be pain or illness based, but I took him to the vet right before he started biting and he was very healthy. I also refuse to pet him when he sits near the mouse or keyboard and try to give him a lot of attention when he's elsewhere on the desk or on my lap.

Does anyone have advice to try to make him stop biting? Thanks.",Craslaz,2022-11-12,11:00:21,2022,11,12,11,0,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,Should I be putting sunscreen on my cat?,"One of my cats is white and light grey with cute lil pink ears and a lil pink nose, so I'm a bit worried about her getting cancer with too much sun exposure. She's strictly indoor only, but does like to lay in sunny spots in the house a few hours a day. Should I be putting sunscreen on her or does window glass cut out enough UV rays to make the risk negligible?

The other things to consider, she's a cat who only likes to be touched on her own terms, so she won't be happy with me trying to smear stuff on her multiple times a day. Also, she's got a bit of a sensitive tummy so I'm worried about her ingesting sunscreen (although of course I'd use one especially made for pets)",Fancy_Ferret2990,2022-11-12,10:19:43,2022,11,12,10,19,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,I'm unsure whether to adopt my current cats sibling sister.,"So I've had my boy coming up for 4 months he's almost 8 months old  He picked me as his person on the very first time I visited and did the same everytime I went to visit his breeder who is a family member I wanted to see if it was a one time thing before deciding if he was my boy. He had no interest in other visitors previously or after just me alone and everyone said wow he chose you you must be his human your the only person he will play and sit with and we've had others visiting several times like you. So I was given him freely knowing I'd give him a good loving home like my previous cats who passed due to age. On adoption day it was asked if I could also take his sister since no one was really wanting her and to keep them as a pair but last minute another family said they wanted her so she was given to them instead    During initial meetings with  the litter his sister was the one I originally was interested in possibly adopting but showed absalutely no interest in me wouldn't even come near me which I didn't mind she in my eyes wasn't the cat for me as I always allowed pets to show if they're interested in me and my family members it was the way I was taught when getting dogs and used the same rule for my current kitten. 

I've now been asked today after the family member was kicked out of the place they were staying if I and my husband could also take my boys sister too permanently firstly by the owner then by the breeder family member. Originally I said no to his owner for various reasons but mostly because this person has a history of on and off again pet ownership when they decide it's too difficult or causing arguments where they live it's how we ended up with our beloved dog 

My boy is amazing but he's a handful and is slowly starting to calm down and be a cuddly cat and has always been loving, he's also starting to follow commands like no, get down off things he isn't supposed to be on with no punishment just redirection or picking him up off something he isn't allowed on. The family member his  breeder called tonight basically begging us to take his sibling as unbeknownst to me   they're also getting ready and in the process of rehoming the 4 other siblings from the same litter she kept them not realizing the costs of owning that many kittens along with the parents. Added the costs of neutering/spaying 4 kittens along with the parents prompted the rehoming kittens on the breeders part.

Here's my biggest issues the girl has not been spayed, no vaccines that we know of, the owner admitted the kitten is incredibly play aggressive and destructive tearing up the place where they lived resulting in arguments over the cat and one of the various reasons they got kicked out.  When we visited previously she litrelly hid and hissed at everyone several timss whereas my boy is social and happily comes to greet new comers to my house he's only hissed once and that was at his breeder *not sure why they still adore him* as it was the first thing I did was ask friends and family to visit and get the cat used to other people coming in his environment.

My husband also is torn while we have the room for another cat and she was originally was supposed to live here as a pair I don't know how my boy will react to his sister after being a single cat for 4 months. Can they still live together as siblings even after being apart this long?  I understand she will need to be spayed ASAP if she does but I'm also worried about the behavior she's displayed while being owned by a family member they do like animals and in no way to be nasty usually have a history of not being able to handle the needs of pets they've owned. My boys a bit scratchy but not destructive except with his own toys through play and occasionally the sofa but he does stop when he's told to use his tree 

I could afford it at a stretch but we'd have to use a low cost spay clinic due to the sudden addition as we planned financially for my current boy making sure we had everything covered vs with the potential sudden rehoming of his sibling with us. We did the same for our dog but didn't plan on potentially owning a second kitten this soon.

PS I want to say his litter was accidental and his parents have both since been neutered and spayed to prevent further litters

Any advice would be appreciated. I apologize it's a long read but I figured some outside input would help",Severe-Meaning-6039,2022-11-12,09:33:52,2022,11,12,9,33,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,"Cat keeps peeing outside the litter box, and is also very destructive.","My cat Oliver won’t stop peeing outside the litter box. He does also pee inside the litter box, and only poops inside the litter box - so he clearly knows how to use it and doesn’t have an issue with it.

I’ve tried everything - uncovered box, partially covered box, fully covered box. All different types of litter. Scooping more often. Changing locations. He keeps peeing on the floor (but again, not every time)

He had a recent vet visit and they didn’t find anything wrong in that area. 

I got him fixed a few months ago, and hoped it would help. It hasn’t. 

My roommate and I lost our deposit at our last apartment over it.

My current apartment isn’t carpeted at all, which helps, because it’s much easier to clean, but it’s still a bad habit I want to break.

 He’s also very destructive. Loves breaking stuff, knocking stuff over, ripping stuff up. He’s still young, just over a year old but again I was hoping he would calm down some after neutering and with a little time, and he hasn’t.

My other cat is so chill that I think I got spoiled and this stuff gets to me sometimes.


Any advice? Aside from these bad habits he’s otherwise a very sweet, EXTREMELY loving, playful, cute lil guy. But all my attempts at training don’t seem to matter and I’m tired of coming home to trash cans knocked over and a puddle of pee on the floor. 

He gets lots of attention so I don’t think it has much to do with that. When I’m not home he plays with my other cat, they’re the best of friends. When I am home he gets a ton of love.",Occasional_Cupcake,2022-11-12,08:27:19,2022,11,12,8,27,Saturday

I never have experienced or noticed him being lonely and/or bored until lately (if I’m reading his behavior correctly). There’s an outdoor cat that hangs around outside all the time (yes she has a home and we are friendly with the owner) and he seems to love her. He will stare at her through the window for a long time and check to see if she has come to visit throughout the day.

He does this at night sometimes, too. 

I am open to getting him a sibling if he would be happier with a friend. I would hate that he wouldn’t be by my side as much, but I do just want him to be thriving.

1,CatAdvice,Aggressive behavior in newly adopted cat?,"My best friend and I adopted a 3 yr old neutered male from a shelter in early September. He was listed as a stray but was definitely someone’s housecat - super calm, obviously well taken care of, etc. He’s a great cat, super quiet, and he did really well with her 2 year old at first.

Now that he’s settled in he’s developed a few weird behaviors. He will cry and cry and cry for food all day long like he’s been starved. He will occasionally try to attack when we’re preparing his food. He’s fed twice a day, mix of wet and dry, in relatively large amounts (slightly more than what’s recommended). We don’t free feed because he will eat until he throws up. It’s like he doesn’t know how to stop. The ONLY toy he will play with is one of those feeder balls with kibble in it. Because he gets food from it. 

He will also get weirdly aggressive for no reason. He’ll be completely chill one minute and with zero warning, bristle up and run at you and pounce with his claws out. He’s gotten my friend’s toddler a couple of times when she’s not even aware he’s there, much less taunting him or doing anything that would trigger an attack. It’ll just come out of nowhere. 

We play with him every day and he has plenty of toys, plus a 6 ft tall cat tree (that he has zero interest in). We’ve tried catnip, different varieties and types of toys, playing more, playing less, etc and nothing seems to be working. He’s super sweet most of the time, we just don’t know what to do about the food motivation and the aggression.

1,CatAdvice,Why do cats feel so different from dogs?,I've had dogs most of my life but recently started volunteering at a cat shelter and I immediately noticed upon petting the cats that they feel nothing like dogs lol. I know that probably sounds obvious but it still surprised me. They're so tiny as well. When they bushed up against me they just felt so small compared to any dog I've encountered. Dogs just feel so meaty and stiff lmao not like cats at all.,AbsAndAssAppreciator,2022-11-12,05:22:37,2022,11,12,5,22,Saturday
1,CatAdvice,New senior cat owner looking for advice,"Hello, 

I just adopted an 11 year old black tabby cat from a friend. From what I was told, she is an indoor cat and was having trouble getting along with other cats in the household. 

I've had cats in the past when I was a kid, but they were all outside cats. I live alone and have had no pets until this kitty came along.

I'm not working this week, so pretty much the routine is chill and watch some tv together, be on the computer while she walks around or chills in my lap or her raised bed next to me, play with toys/laser chase, eat treats, sleep in my bed with me when its night time.

I feel like she might really want to go outside. I have a fish pond and she likes to chill on the windowsill and watch them. I want to go out and do yard/pond work, but every time I go to the door, she comes, meows and waits for me to open the door so she can go outside. Maybe it's just because she knows there's fish out there? I'm not sure, but I've been staying inside with her because I feel bad. Her previous owner gave me a harness for outside but she absolutely hates it, she will NOT let me put it on her unless I really force it, which I don't want to do. One suggestion I've been given since she tends to follow me around a lot, (when she's not mad at me over the harness lol) was to just let her outside with nothing, but I'm nervous something could happen. 

Anyway, that's about it. I guess I'm mainly looking for advice or anything else I could do to make sure the cat is happy, engaged and comfortable, especially since it seems like she sleeps a lot...and on top of that, once I go back to work in a few days, she'll be alone for 8-10 hours each work day. I plan on getting her one or two of those multi-level cat towers to start.

Thank you!",Sparkle_Pony_Master,2022-11-12,04:54:42,2022,11,12,4,54,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,May have introduced new kitten to my 4yr old cat too quickly?,"Hi everyone! So my bf and I have a 4 year old cat, Mylo. He’s our world and he’s very mellow, he likes to play but only for short periods of time and lately we were feeling like we weren’t able to give enough attention so we wanted to get him a friend. (When I brought Mylo home as a kitten I had 3 roommates with 3 cats and he had no issues and they all adjusted fairly quickly.) Now that it’s the other way around and he’s been a solo cat for 2 years, he’s not happy. This kitten is way more energetic than the owner described, and for the first 5 days he was tolerating it but now he’s isolating, barely eating, and super grumpy. We did not introduce them correctly now that we’re looking into it, so we’ve started to put him in my bf’s office (he always naps in there and can access the patio - he loves hanging out there) and he finally ate but its a process and he’s eating maybe once a day. He’s always started growling a bit and is pretty on edge. At night he still comes around for bedtime and tries to sleep with us but runs away if the kitten bugs him. Should we continue to keep them separate a majority of the time until he starts warming up? We feel so bad and I know these things take time but it hurts to see Mylo seem so unhappy with what we did. Any advice is greatly appreciated!",-hazeydays,2022-11-12,04:50:26,2022,11,12,4,50,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,Considering re-homing my 10+ yo cat - help,"This is something that I never thought I would think of doing in the 10 years I’ve had my cat. Please be kind in the comments. Im in the consideration phase and haven’t made a decision.

My cat is over 10 years old. She’s been with me through many moves, and currently we full time RVing. Have been for some time.

Having her in my home has become extremely stressful and frustrating. I’d like to preface this by saying that she has been to a veterinarian and they informed me that she is in good health.

I’ve always had a problem with her incessant meowing. Meowing for food, meowing at the door to go outside, meowing for no reason at all. It’s not a cute meow. It’s a very loud yowling meow that is like nails on a chalkboard. 

She has a routine for eating once in the morning and once at night, the same as her dog sister. It’s plenty of food maybe even too much as she is slightly overweight. I recently switched back to dry kibble because she stopped eating wet food all together. Originally switched wet food because she stopped eating her Acana kibble. At first she was really enjoying it and then suddenly she just completely stopped eating it. When I started giving her lower quality dry kibble, she proceeded to eat again and we haven’t had issues. I’ve seen her not eat for 2 days before switching foods. 


She is outdoor/indoor, only because I feel awful about having her in a small space. She’ll go outside for about 30 minutes then come back to the door to meow and get in. She’ll even meow at the neighbors doors. Again this is not a cute meow. After letting her in she will be out the door after 15 minutes to go back outside. If I allowed it, she would do this all day.

I brush her every day, I play with her every day, but as soon as that’s done, she will go back to pacing around the house, alternating between meowing at her food bowl, meowing at the door, or just sitting in the middle of the room meowing for no reason.

She constantly tries to get on my chest when I’m laying down and even if I try to gently push her off, she will push back as hard as she can and I have to literally pick her up and put her down. As soon as she touches the ground she jumps back up. She doesn’t simply lay on my chest, she claws into my skin and is persistent about rubbing her nose and a half open mouth on me over and over. It’s really gross I hate it and it’s unhygienic. That’s all she wants to do when she’s trying to lay on my chest she has not interest in laying in my lap or anywhere else that’s easier for me. I’ve tried. More and more she has been keeping me up all night long doing this.

If I’m sitting at my computer, she will jump up and sit on my keyboard. I try to allow her to stay on my desk in front of me where she likes to be but after a while, my back starts to ache, and I have to put her down. Usually she will immediately jump back up again after I put her down to try and resume the position and again persistently push herself into that space while I try to remove her. It’s pretty aggressive.

I have to be careful about how often I let her out because she tends to go through garbage out there and eats it then comes inside to vomit all over the carpet. I also make sure she isn’t out at night because there are some rough stray cats out there at night.

I also have breast reduction surgery coming up soon and I know that she’s going to constantly be trying to get on my chest while I’m healing. And that’s going to be painful. 

I love her, but I can’t help but think that she isn’t getting what she needs here. I can’t even figure out what it is that she needs because I’m giving her everything that I possibly can.  

I’m at my wits end and at a point where I’m actually considering rehoming her so that she can live out the rest of her life somewhere where she can do all the things that she wants to do.  I wish I could explain how aggressive she is when it comes to all of this. It’s not cute, it’s not endearing. It’s over the top and difficult to deal with. It is driving me insane.

Anyway, any perspective or tips for potentially rehoming her would be appreciated. If she did find a place to live I would like to potentially have updates on how she is and potentially contribute to costs to make sure she’s comfortable and happy.",Bidibidipewpew,2022-11-12,03:46:38,2022,11,12,3,46,Saturday
1,CatAdvice,Worried about my cat getting neutered,"Wasn't too worried about my cat getting neutered UNTIL the vet made me sign a form (can't remember but it was something about consenting to anesthetic/risk of the anesthetic). My cat didn't get neutered that day cause she was underweight, she's due next Friday. To say that I'm anxious is an understatement. I'm so worried that she's going to die in surgery or something. Maybe I'm just paranoid but I've had so many losses this year, I'd be devastated if anything happened.

1,CatAdvice,How can my 6 year old cat realize the two 1 year old cats are just trying to play?,"So I have two cats that are about a year and a half. I had them since they were about 6-8 weeks old. Always been playful, especially with one another because they are brother and sister. When my girlfriend moved in, she brought her 6 year old cat into the house. Her cat does not play. Like at all. Even when I try to play with her, its pretty rare she does it. And if the other cats are around she wont. So naturally, the other two try to play with her when they are hyper, and she is nooooot about it. Runs away every time. Will smack them and hiss, puffy tail, runs under the bed, etc. They try to smell and lick her but she is not about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to help her cat calm down and not think she's being attacked? She's super defensive as well. For example one of them walked past her the other day, gave a friendly meow, and she swatted at her for no reason. I just want them all to be happy lol",mattsteeleNJ,2022-11-12,03:40:04,2022,11,12,3,40,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,cordless water fountain?,"I’m just wondering if anybody else has ever purchased a battery operated water fountain for their cat? My cat drinks a fair amount of water out of his regular dish, but I accidentally left the bathroom faucet on and he seemed very intrigued/intent to drink from it, so it seems like a fountain would be good for him.

However, I truly have nowhere to plug one in. The options include: kitchen counters next to the stove (a bit of a safety hazard), hallway (bound to get knocked over by us in the dark and him with his zoomies), in an extension cord right next to our TV. None of these sound like a good idea to me, and I don’t think running an extension cord to where his dish is currently is a good idea because he loves to chew on cords.

It seems as though all the big brands I typically see people using are plug-ins. I found one battery operated one on Amazon, but it was like $80. 

Maybe they just don’t exist, but I figured I would see if anyone else has had a similar situation and has any suggestions or recommendations.",sunna22,2022-11-12,01:21:46,2022,11,12,1,21,Saturday
1,CatAdvice,How to keep roommate's cat away from my door at night?,"Let me start by saying I love this little cat outside of the wee hours of the morning. She's sweet and friendly and doesn't make trouble outside of clawing up paper towels, which is easily dealt with.

But because my roommate does not let her into his room overnight, every night for the last few nights (I moved in about two weeks ago) around 2-4am she has started meowing outside my door loid enpugh for me to hear through earplugs, and sticking her paw under the gap between the door and the floor. I know the typical solution is to ignore this until she realizes she won't be rewarded - however, in doing so she wakes up MY cat, who sleeps in my bed at night. I play with him before bed so he normally sleeps through the night, but she wakes him and then they spend anywhere from fifteen minutes to an hour batting playfully at each other under the door, after which my boy gets zoomies and keeps me up for another 15-20. So they both get rewarded for the bad behavior, and I get to listen to loud meowing and my door rattling until they settle.

The cats are friendly enough together, and around the same age (mine is 3yrs, his is 1yr) but they don't really play with each other yet, as my boy is still settling in and doesn't feel safe enough to play outside of my room yet.

My roommate is still new to cat ownership and doesn't play with her enough. I know the long term solution is to make him tire her out before bed or at least keep her in his room while he sleeps - but I don't want to sour things between us so soon by pestering him about his cat. But at this point this is affecting my quality of sleep, while he sleeps like a log and doesn't hear any of it even though he's right across the hall. I need a temporary solution until I can impress upon him the importance of engaging his cat.

I was thinking maybe a scat mat (NOT the electric kind, I'm not a monster) for in front of my door so at least, but if she learns to step over it, does anything exist that could keep them from pawing under the door? Preferably something that costs less than the 50 bucks for the motion detector air sprayer - that's a last resort in case nothing else works.",gyllbane,2022-11-12,01:18:22,2022,11,12,1,18,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,Help! My other pets won't leave my baby cat alone!,"Hi all.

I have four animals, doggies Blue (13) and Macie (11), and kitties Bristol (6) and Phoenix (3). 

In the past 3 days, Bristol will not stop attacking Phoenix. She acts like she's scared of him, which she's never done. And Phoenix is an orange boy with one braincell, he's the absolute sweetest. He doesn't instigate anything and is not aggressive at all but for whatever reason she won't leave him alone. 

She is not showing aggression to the dogs. When not around him, she doesn't seem like she's in pain or doesn't feel well. I've checked her over for any injuries. They've lived together since Phoenix was a baby. There have been no changes within the house, like routines or moving things around. Everything is normal.

What I think is weird is also in the past 3 days, my dog Blue has been trying to hump Phoenix and also will not leave him alone. (Playfully, no aggression.) Blue has never done this with any animal. He has never shown any... I guess sexual behaviors. 

The cats are both indoor cats. But I'm wondering if Phoenix has gotten into something that's made him smell different or something like that. He and Bristol have their tifts but it never last this long. And the fact that Blue is all over him too is weird. 

Any suggestions or advice would be great! I hate having to keep the kitties separated because that means one has to be by themselves in a room (due to floor plan in the house, there is no other way to separate them, and I hate this.)

I've been giving Bristol anxiety treats the past few days, and bought one of those wall plug-ins that are supposedly good for calming cats. With Christmas coming up, I wasn't prepared financially for a vet visit, but of course will absolutely do it if it helps my Bristol baby.

1,CatAdvice,How to tell if cat is using the litter box post surgery,"I have two cats and one litter box (used to have two boxes, but they literally never used the second one). One of my cats had surgery on Tuesday to remove a tumor on top of her head and is currently wearing a cone. I noticed I haven't seen her using the litter box since her surgery, but she also hasn't been doing her business outside of the box either. Last night, I noticed her looking into the entrance of the box but backing away. This isn't common practice, so I'm assuming she thinks she can't fit into the box with the cone on (she totally could, but y'know). I removed the top of the box last night, but I still haven't seen her use it. 

I'm not sure if I'm just missing the times she's used the bathroom, or if she hasn't been using it at all. She is eating and drinking like normal. Since I have another cat using the same box, it's hard to tell for sure. Any advice on how I could better keep track?

1,CatAdvice,Cat/kitten will not stop using carpet…,I have a 11 month old kitten who I just adore and refuse to rehome. He is already neutered but he keeps peeing on the carpet. VET FOUND NO ISSUES WITH HIM. I’ve taken him multiple times with a clean bill of health. I steam clean his accidents and always thoroughly clean it. But he keeps on doing it so moved the food and stuff to where he was peeing so he didn’t associate it with the bathroom. That worked until he found a new spot… He used to use the litter box full time and it hasn’t moved or changed. Nothing in the environment has changed either that would have caused this. Then just a few moments ago he just used the litter box to pee and then decided to get out of it to poop?? I am truly BAFFLED as to why he won’t use the litterbox for all of his potty habits. He used it fine originally and it’s an automatic one so it’s always clean. I have 2 other cats that adore him and he adores back.

So I have two cats and I live in an apartment in a city that is known to have mice/rat problems. 

I have recently made a small nook for my cats to chill in with a box and pillow and they spend hours in there. They feel very comfortable and warm in their new box.

Today I found what I believe to be a rats tail (really thin, ribbed with some hair,around 6 centimetres ) in front of that box. I am panicking right now because 1. I might have a pest problem in my house and 2. One of my cats ate a rat and left the tail. They never brought a pest to my bed or anything in the past.

1,CatAdvice,Advice on adopting a cat,"Hi guys,

I’ve never owned a cat before but want to adopt a cat. I’m really an indoor person so spend a lot time indoor. Also I work from home 90% of the time with the occasional office days. I live in an apartment that’s neither big nor small. 

Since I’m a new owner for now I really only am looking to adopt one cat. I’ve been doing some research on cats and Ragdoll seems to be really lovely cat I’m interested in. Is the only option to get a kitten Ragdoll? However I’m worried if I’m only getting one kitten will they have issues growing up? I read that kittens often want to be adopted in pairs when growing up to adulthood as a playmate and socializing. So getting one kitten will cause issues right so I shouldn’t do it?

Should I look for an adult cat in that case since I don’t want to adopt two cats? Is it hard to find an adult Ragdoll?",Ukkoclap,2022-11-11,20:52:48,2022,11,11,20,52,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Why does my cat suddenly hate my room?,"I have had my cat for a little over 2 years now, we got him and his brother from the same litter and they are inseparable. He has always been a little stand off-ish at first but he loves attention and pets. About 6 months ago, my family got another kitten that one of the siblings of the other 2 cats had. Ever since bringing home this kitten, he has been acting strange when coming into my room (hissing, crying and just freaked out in general) but he used to come into my room and hang out all the time before the kitten. Him and the kitten get along very well, they are always snuggling and licking each other.

1,CatAdvice,Cats getting asthma,"One of my 2.5 years old cat got asthma last year. It becomes somewhat severe during rainy and cold seasons where she'll be having breathing difficulties and unable to eat properly. Vet gives some antibiotics during those days and gets sent home and the cat will get antibiotics once a again when she starts having difficulties again. My 10 month old kitten got sick (105.2 C fever) 4 weeks ago but had perfect blood reports and vet wasn't able to find the cause. After 1-2 weeks he became normal again but since last week he started having a cold with sneezing and runny nose. Vet thought it must be a ususal cold but since it didn't get better vet said it must be asthma. Those 2 cats have a runny nose and is congested sometimes. Then another cat started having asthma recently. He's 1.5 years old. He doesn't have a runny nose and is not congested but he starts coughing for sometime several times a day. At first I thought it's a hairball but it wasn't. This was prevalent since sometime ago but I noticed the frequency increased recently. Vet said he is also having asthma. I have 8 other cats and they are normal. These days it's heavily raining in my area and it's pretty cold. Don't know if the environmental condition led to this. Does anyone has an idea why my cats are getting asthma? We have got rid of fragrances, air sprays, mosquito repellents and other detergents as vet said those can cause asthma. Since asthma is not contagious I don't know why more and more cats are getting it.",suncracker2003,2022-11-11,19:51:33,2022,11,11,19,51,Friday
1,CatAdvice,Cat (16) bullying dog (7),"Hi all hope you can help.

Recently my partner and I moved in together and both brought our respective pets to our new home together. Both cat and dog have never cohabited with the opposite species before.

Dog and cat have been living separately so to speak for the past 2 months with a pet gate separating them. The reason for the gate was firstly for their initial comfort but also my cat is on thyroid meds which I wouldnt want the dog to eat as kitty is a grazer. Secondly- lovely little dog, but does have the au de pupper and sheds like crazy so partner and I agreed he would be a downstairs dog.

My issue is that as kitty has gotten braver over the last two weeks, he is coming to the dog gate and literally boxing the dog through the bars, hissing, yowling, etc. Doggo gets excited and paws through the gate back at him, tail wagging, woofing in excitement.

I break them up as I dont want them to get hurt but is this a part of the adjustment process?

Last night the cat instigated his reign of terror 3 separate times and I caught him slinking back for a 4th before telling him off.

I dont expect them to be besties but am concerned if it continues to escalate in this manner that one or both will get hurt or stressed.

TIA

TLDR- cat and dog newly coexisting together. Cat has become less scaredy and is beating up dog through pet gate and im looking for advice",IBrakeForKoalas,2022-11-11,19:44:34,2022,11,11,19,44,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Cat Suggestions,"Hi everyone, 

I absolutely adore cats, I think they are beautiful, intelligent and so so soft. Lately, I’ve been looking for a pet to keep me company in my apartment. Its not small, but it’s certainly not as big as a house. Unfortunately, I’ve never owned a cat before because I used to be extremely allergic to them, however over time and exposure, I’ve gradually decreased the severity of my allergy. However, watery eyes and a runny nose are still very much a thing. I also work long hours and travel pretty often. Now, I would be able to get a cat on planes, for long trips, but it would be harder to travel for say a weekend.

I’m looking for a cat that is particularly low maintenance. A breed that can take care of itself for a day or two with a self timed feeder and some toys. A not so energetic cat that won’t mind apartment living, but still doesn’t mind being pet, or watching movies on the couch together. I prefer short haired cats, but I really prefer hypoallergenic cats to save me from overdosing on Benadryl. 

I’ve done some research and Russian Blues seem to be the best bet. Is that correct? Are there other breeds? I love the Russian blue coat and eyes and from videos I’ve seen, I do love their temperament. They seem to be pretty self-reliant but curious and sociable. 

Am I right in this discernment, are there other cats you would recommend. Any tips or suggestions are welcomed. 



Thank you.",Holyrollerfliper12,2022-11-11,18:53:51,2022,11,11,18,53,Friday

1,CatAdvice,I didn't know how difficult having a cat is,"I've had many pets, dogs, parrots, fish, rabbits, yadda yadda. Nothing compares to the difficulty of a cat. The daily danger of the balcony I can't get rid of because my mother goes in and out of the balcony plenty of times and doesn't want to cover the entire balcony up. The constant, literally constant energy. The toys that keep attention only for a little bit. The run and dash all day apart from the rare daytimes she actually sleeps. She seems restless. The jumping to everything, kitchen, oven, trays, plates, breaking things, a plate and a vase that was my mother's favourite, since it was her sister's gift. I can't even THINK of using the computer. She bites and pulls the cables, the computer's mouse etc.   
I need to run after the cat constantly, literally constantly. I don't know what to do. Please help.   
Get a diffuser? Does this do something?   
It's like I have a 2 year old that can jump everywhere, bites and has big nails that dig into your skin. Her energy is the same as my cousin when he was a toddler. Never never running out of. At least he didn't have nails, didn't bite and couldn't jump at the edge of the balcony and all those places. He also didn't throw stuff down or broke things. I don't want to give her.

1,CatAdvice,any reason why my cat keeps stealing my squish fidgets? should I be worried?,"I have ADHD, and using squish fidgets (""mini mochi squishies"" is what I think they're called) helps me focus sometimes. Recently, I've noticed one of my cats, Lillian, has been stealing them. 

I keep them on my nightstand so I can grab them when I leave for school in the morning. But ive noticed they've been ending up on the floor, in my bed, and in the hallway. I have a high feeling it's Lillian because she's the only one that really likes to ""hunt"", or grab and make off with things that interest her ig. but I don't know why she would be grabbing my squishes. I've looked them over, and I haven't seen any bite marks on them, and from the very few I have found are from where I assume she's been grabbing them, so I don't think she's been trying to eat them. 

A few days ago, I got curious and held one up to her. She sniffed it a little bit and licked it a few times, but just wanted me to pet her. 

so does anyone have any reason for this behavior? and if so, should I be worried about it? 

additional information if needed: 
- I have two cats, and she's the oldest at 13, and the other at ~8 is a lazy little thing
- I'm pretty certain she's a domestic long-hair, but can't be too sure 
- she's been spayed since around the moment we could get her fixed
- the only things she's really ""hunted"" have been a small bird decoration on my desk, and many straws. 
- she's a pretty kitty, not important but it is to me &lt;3",gotBonked,2022-11-11,12:31:17,2022,11,11,12,31,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Getting a kitten has completely changed my older cat.,"My first cat Poppy is the best most friendly cat I have ever met.

1,CatAdvice,Single Cat Syndrome - Can it be resolved?,"After reading about it, I believe my cat (2 years old, F) has single cat, or single kitten, syndrome. She was rescued by us at only five weeks old when she was rejected by her mother, and didn’t interact with any other cat until she was far older. 

Since she was a kitten she’s had problems with biting, and nothing seems to be able to stop the behaviour - not yelping, not walking away, not distracting her with toys, nothing. I believe that what would have prevented it is having a playmate who could bite back. She was never properly socialized, and I’m wondering if getting another cat could help change her behaviour. 

The problem is, she’s always been aggressive towards other cats any time she’s been around them. I worry that another cat would just cause long term stress if she’s already used to just being around myself and my roommates and not interacting with other cats. 

So my question is: can my chonically solitary cat’s single cat syndrome be solved with another cat? Or is it too late for her to be socialized?",largdelc,2022-11-11,11:32:37,2022,11,11,11,32,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Should I take both or one cat with me when I move out of my parent's house?,"So, I'm probably going to move out of my parents house soon and move into a shared house with roommates. My mom thinks since it's a smaller space I should one take one cat with me and leave the other one at home with them and she'll make sure to take good care of him. We have two cats, Finn (7m), and Evee (6f). My mom thinks I should just take Evee since she is more of my cat. Evee's favorite person is me and is not really interested in anyone else is our family. She hangs out in my bedroom most of the time and loves to sleep in my bed with me. She often follows me around the house or gets me to follow her. She licks me and just generally wants to be near me most of the time. She is scared of people she doesn't know and sometimes hides from Finn. Finn is super territorial and loud and rude. He's like a jerk in cat form. He has sprayed every couch in the house to claim it as his, despite being neutered. (My mom is concerned that if I take him with me too, he's going to do that again.) He likes to scream, a lot, and he can go for hours without taking a break. (My mom is also concerned he will bother roommates.) He likes to attack Evee, just like randomly or if he's hungry or bored. (She's kind of scared of him and hides from him at times and they just don't coexist in the same room for long periods of time well. Evee stays in my room and Finn is usually downstairs.) Also Finn claims all the cat toys and cat trees. We have 2 cat trees and essentially Finn is only one who uses them because he has decided they are his and Evee can't use them. Sometimes she'll go in the bottom cubby of one of the trees because Finn never goes in there because he's too big. Evee won't really play with toys if Finn is around because he takes them. She only plays in my room. 

BUT I feel like no one in my family really spends time with Finn like I do. He has long hair and needs to be brushed everyday so it doesn't get matted. I'm the one who feeds hims and brushes him and plays with him. No one else does. I want to bring him with me because I love him and I don't know if he'll get the attention he needs at home with my parents. He will miss me and Evee. (I don't think Evee will miss him though). My mom says she'll make sure to give him more attention but I'm not sure if she really will.

1,CatAdvice,Should my cat move?,"I'm looking for help from some animal lovers. My wife and I rent a room in a shared house. When we moved in about two years ago, our landlady was looking for a new cat, and we went with her to pick out Ghost, just a baby kitten at the time. He has always been unofficially ""our cat"" - he is very attached to us, and doesn't want anything to do with our roommates/landlady. He would spend all day cuddling if he could and gets very upset when we leave for work. There is another cat, Grim, who is a bit older and is definitely my landlady's cat. Ghost and Grim get along decently, they play and once in a while nap together. Both cats officially belong to my landlady but they have made their preferences clear. Both cats are indoor cats.

My wife and I are about to move into quite a small apartment. It's a much smaller space and we both work full time out of the home. I want to ask my landlady if we can take Ghost with us. It breaks my heart to think of him looking for us and I love him so much. I really worry how he would be without us because he is so attached. He was separated from his mother very young and still tries to suckle with us. However, it seems cruel to take him away from the other cat, into a much smaller space, where we will be gone all day and the apartment empty.

\#1 Can my cats go to my backyard? They are not outdoor cats so I don't know the protocol but if I let them out occasionally are they going to stay in my backyard or immediately run away? Do other people with indoor cats have any insight here? They always loved lounging on my balcony so I'd love to keep giving them fresh air. 

\#2 my garage is the only real place their litter boxes can be so they need to have access to it but, with my coming and going, any tips on keeping them safe &amp; not able to run away?",Mcina31,2022-11-11,08:39:28,2022,11,11,8,39,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Wet cat food -- my cat only likes fish. Is that a problem?,"I've been feeding my kitten (9 months +) a high-quality grain-free kibble along with a portion of wet food twice a day. I've tried so many different brands and styles of wet food, but it seems like my cat only likes fish-based Catit. With everything else, she'll eat at most half of a 3 oz container, and often less or none.  

I thought this was fine, but have been reading here about not feeding cats too much fish-based food so am concerned. Should I stick to the kibble, and maybe give her some of the fish-based food as a treat?  

She does drink plenty of water, and has from the day I brought her home. (I even bought a fountain but haven't set it up yet because she's very happy to lap, lap, lap out of her water bowl.)",Interrogatus,2022-11-11,07:26:43,2022,11,11,7,26,Friday
1,CatAdvice,Is this a cause for concern? Or is my kitten just turning into a cat?,"My wonderful kitten isn't playing as much as she used to. She's about 9 1/2 months old and used to want to play all the time. We'd have super-active play sessions for an hour in the morning, another hour in the early evening, and about 15 minutes at night. And she'd have played more if I could have managed it.  

I switch out the toys on her wand (feather, worm, streamer) and toss a variety of springs and bouncy balls and fluffy balls and furry mice. But now, she generally only seriously chases after the wand toy for about 10 minutes in the morning, and less than two minutes later in the day. She still seems to want to play -- she gives me the ""play"" meow, along with the hunting squeak -- but then doesn't play. Everything else -- eating, drinking, pooping, sleeping -- seems normal, and her jumping skills have gotten better and better. 

Not sure if this is normal at her age, or if I should be concerned. Hesitant to bring her to the vet unless I need to, having spent a ton of money on all the ""kitten's first year"" vet visits including spay. I appreciate any input!",Interrogatus,2022-11-11,07:19:43,2022,11,11,7,19,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Switching over to pine pellet litter. Issues.,"Hi everyone!

I have two cats and I’m struggling with litter. I typically buy unscented clumping clay litter. I have two open, big litter boxes. I’m really struggling with them tracking litter everywhere. These cats have long hair and the litter also gets in their hair. I recently bought pine pellet litter hoping this would help with the mess. They are refusing to use their normal litter boxes with only pine pellets. I also have a disposable box with pine pellets and the litter to get them used to the pellets, they just keep using this one. I don’t know what to do. Does anyone have any tips on getting them to use the pine pellet litter boxes? Or any other litter tips in general?  One of them just went outside the box. Which they never do.  If I switch back to the clumping clay litter, what can I do about tracking? It gets stuck in their paws and fur. Any other litter suggestions?",morganpaige12,2022-11-11,06:36:47,2022,11,11,6,36,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Is my cat broken?,"I live in California, my fiancé lives in Guatemala and we’ve been doing this long distance thing for bout 2 years now. 

I came to Guatemala and plan to be here for 2 months so I can spend the holidays with her and her family. The plan was to go back to LA together along with her dogs. Naturally we both wanted my cat to get along with her two 2-year old maltese mixes so I brought him along, but now that they’ve met and after my Scottish fold was being aggressivley barked at he just seems paranoid. It looked like a classic playground bullying scenario. Now he isnt doing all the things he normally does like eat, drink, play, use the restroom you name it. All he does is hide all day. 

Back at home we have a Pomeranian in the same household and they have no issues. It seems like he has a lot on his mind and I do understand that all this was a lot to take in for him, the new environment, people, animals. Coming into this I completely understood how it was going to be stressful for him but didn’t expect myself to be this worried. 

The dogs seem like they have social issues themselves as well. I’m not dog expert but looks like they run the house. They rarely respond when being called, bark at almost everything (even the maid who lives in the house), follow her everywhere (even into the bathroom), they only let my fiancé and her brother touch them. Yes, it could be a natural instinct for them to feel as if they need to protect her. 

So now I’m wondering, will it get better if I wait it out and let them be? Do I just let my cat hide? is my cat broken? If someone could point me in the right direction on how to go about this situation that would be much appreciated. Thanks",Nervous-Bake4482,2022-11-11,05:39:47,2022,11,11,5,39,Friday

Would a cat be okay with going back and forth between my boyfriend’s and my house, pretty much living at 2 different houses? My boyfriend loves cats so this is something we both want. Any tips for how to make a cat be okay with this schedule?

The schedule would be consistent week to week. I don’t know if the cat would be okay if I made this a regular thing right from the start.

1,CatAdvice,Need Advice. Adopted A Pair of Cats Last March. One Is Friendly One Is Timid.,"I adopted my first two cats last March from a very credible cat adoption group in my city. They are not from the same liter, however they were a package deal. The female cat took a couple weeks to become familiar with me however now she is a total love bug and will cuddle at any opportunity she can get. However, the male is extremely timid. He won't let anyone touch him unless he is completely distracted when eating his wet food. Just recently he started to raise his butt in the air when I pet him while he eats (I am assuming this a good sign?). Usually, I put out my hand for him to smell and he will do a little sniff and then just run away. I am just totally lost with how to get him socialized. Is it normal for it to take this long? Will he ever be comfortable around me? Do some cats just not like humans? What are signs that he's becoming more comfortable? What else can I do, is it just a waiting game at this point? I just want to show this little man some love and make him a happy boy. 

The things I've tried are hand feeding, playing with him, and sitting in their room.

1,CatAdvice,Is my brothers cat BROKEN!? (Inappropriate elimination) please help!,"My brother has an Almost 1 year old kitten/cat. When I first got the kitten for him it was fine. Had a sensitivity to a certain brand and went through couple weeks of having diarrhoea at 12 weeks. Was fine after we figured out what the issue was and was peeing and pooping normally in the litter tray until he turned 6 months old. 
My brother is very stressed out at the moment and hoping someone has an answer out there. The cat started off pooping outside the litter box frequently he didn’t completely abandon the box but he would feel comfortable pooping in that one spot like the bathroom. Used enzyme cleaner and everything but still he kept going there then we took the bathroom mat away and he stopped for a couple weeks then went back there even when there was no bathroom mat and began pooping there. This went on for a couple months, vet said he was fine and that it was behavioural. We then found out he had been pooping under the bed. Then he started peeing on the bathroom floor. We put a litter box in the bathroom but still he peed outside the box. So at this point he’s started pooping back in his box and peeing on the bathroom floor. We figured he needed to be neutered but we was also aware that it was a habit by now so we needed to break the habit. He got neutered and we confined him to a room with his litter box, showed him how to use it. We even put two litter boxes one for pee one for poop ( if that’s what the issue was) STILL he pees right outside the box but poops inside the box. So after maybe a month of re training him we let him out and he went and peed in 3 different spots. The litter is soft like sand but it can’t be the litter because he is using it for pooping. The vet said he is healthy but my brother will get a blood test done last resort. Let’s just say the blood test comes back fine? What then? What could this possibly be? What is wrong with him? We have tried calming diffusers, more than one litter box, open litter box, soft litter, litter training, enzyme cleaner each time, big enough litter box. Boxes are scooped daily. Tried different litter.  He gets 1/2 hours of playtime a day and everything he could possibly need as an indoor cat. He is the only cat. Surely it cannot be marking behaviour? He got neutered about 2 months ago. If it was a problem with his bladder then why would he start with pooping inappropriately first then peeing? We have also tried litter attract but it’s like he’s not abandoning his box he’s just peeing in other places but more and more frequently. Is there such a thing as cats having an overreactive bladder? So I don’t know if things like a urinalysis will be of any help. Nothing is working. My brother just keeps spending money on things for the cat to help him or replacing things that the cat has ruined. PLEASE HELP. He was fine until about 6 months ago when it all started and nothing drastically changed for his behaviour to change. If someone knows what we should do or if they have any helpful information please please help- rehoming is not an option",UnknownUkhti,2022-11-11,03:42:06,2022,11,11,3,42,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Cat Anxiety Remedies,"Hello,

I have a super anxious cat. To the point that nothing I did worked. There was been a few post about it here. Long story short she was put on a very low dose of prozac. Two weeks after she is back to herself. 

I am hoping that maybe she can be in it for a year and I can slowly take her off of it. 

While she is doing better I do notice that she will be sleeping and if my fiance starts doing dishes she will get up immediately and make sure it is safe before going back to bed. None of my other 3 cats do this. I do notice that playing music or having some type of noise helps ""masks"" other sounds and she can sleep. This can be very simple sounds, doors opening, etc. And they can be happening far away from the room she is in, and she will still get a bit panicked.

Other than playing more with her (which I have been doing), what else can I do to help her ease her anxiety?

Any tips are highly appreciated 🙏🏻.

1,CatAdvice,Leaving 2 cats alone 9hrs/day or bring to parents’ home?,"Hello Everyone,

I have two lovely cats :) They’ve been with me since the start of the pandemic and so they have only ever known home-life with me. That’s the norm for them - wake up, wake me up, play, eat, and enjoy :)

The problem is that I have to return to work in person next year. I am dreading and feeling anxious about how they will adjust because they’ve been with me for about 2yrs 24/7 together basically all the time. I go out and they have been alone but not long. I realize that I’ve spoiled them and worried about how they will adjust.

My question is, would it be better to have the two of them left home alone for the 9hr work day, and play with them plenty once I am home? Or should I bring them to my parents’ daily so that they have a larger place to roam around and some human interaction? They’re still skittish of my parents and I have brought them over 1-2x a week for the past several weeks to get used to it. They’ll follow me around wherever I go at my parents’ home but they’ll have a bit of fun exploring and climbing and jumping. At our own home, it’s tinier, and they’re content and happy to lounge in their cat tree.

Would it be better to have them be in the comfort of their own home, without company, for 9hrs/5x week? Or would it be better to bring them to my parents’ where they can explore, have human company, but are skittish?

1,CatAdvice,How Do I Know If My Cat Is Better Off an Only Cat?,"About 10 months ago, we adopted an 8-month-old former feral from a rescue that keeps their available cats in a pet store. When I observed him and later met him in the common cat room, The Buddy ignored the other cats in the room in favor of me, and later, my husband. He adores humans, and anyone who enters our house is immediately greeted by The Buddy, who's never met a lap he didn't like. My husband and I don't get to travel together a lot, but the few times we have since adopting The Buddy, we had friends and neighbors look in on him three or four times a day, and we're told he was very starved for attention. He showed a little separation anxiety when we returned from a recent (short) trip to see my 81-year-old mom, and I wonder if he might like a friend when we (especially I) can't be around all day like we usually are (we both mostly work from home). 

I've found a 4-month-old female who loves cats more than she loves humans, and she's unbonded. The foster thinks she sounds like a good match for our cat, especially since she won't compete for our attention and she's a beta, so I'd been thinking we'd foster to adopt (I met her and she's so, so sweet). Per advice we read, I brought home a piece of her bedding; the Buddy sniffed it for a long time in a crouched position, then ran upstairs and starting patrolling the house. In doing some reading it sounds like the fact that he didn't hiss or avoid the smell is at least not a negative sign, but I'm super stressed about the introductions (I use Jackson Galaxy as my guide, so we're going with the separate-room plan) and the tension I saw in his body language.

Is there any way to know if your cat wants to be an only cat before you bring one home? I wouldn't want to subject the kitten to a new home only to have it not work out after however many weeks we devote to a trial ...",krystynlo,2022-11-11,01:24:01,2022,11,11,1,24,Friday

1,CatAdvice,"New cat (2 yr old, F) stalking and chasing resident cat (4 yr old, F) after 6 months of introductions","Hi fellow cat lovers. Long time cat owner here in desperate need of some advice regarding our two cats. For some background, my partner and I have a female cat, Luna, who we have had since 2019. She's about four years old. She's a tiny cat, is very friendly, but can be a bit timid. She used to live with an elderly (18 yr old) male cat and got along quite well with him before he passed. Back in June, we opted to adopt a second cat and brought home our new addition, Mochi. Mochi is a two year old female, who is extremely outgoing and friendly with people. She is also significantly larger than Luna. We did slow introductions for months, with each introduction stage successful, until they are unsupervised. When given the chance, Mochi stalks and charges at Luna, which ultimately terrifies her. Luna is not typically the aggressor, but will hiss whenever she notices signs of Mochi's incoming aggression. In thinking about it, it's really difficult for us to know if Mochi is instigating play, or actually aims to hurt Luna. Either way, Luna interprets all of her advances as a threat. It has been about 6 months since our initial adoption, and we have not been able to curb the stalking behavior. I have personally always owned cats, but have only introduced kittens to adult cats, and have not ever attempted to introduce two adult cats. We would be so grateful for any thoughts or advice on this behavior! 

tldr; new female cat stalks and chases resident female cat after months of slow introductions. Unsure of new cat's motives, but if left alone, always ends up in a fight. Please help. 🙏",traversing-wyvern,2022-11-11,01:20:25,2022,11,11,1,20,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Can I leave a cat alone the first day I adopt it?,"Hi friends!

I’m looking to meet and hopefully adopt a senior cat this Saturday. However, I have a previously obligated event to attend that night and would need to leave the cat alone. Here’s a timeline of how the day would go:

12pm: meet cats
3-6:30pm: return home and bond
6:30-11pm: leave
11pm-later: be home

I read that it can be good for cats to have their own safe room for the first few days so I would make my bedroom the calm zone with all his things to get used to me. That way, if I do need to leave, I can put him in my room to get used to me and to chill out. 

What are your thoughts on this? It doesn’t seem like there’s a clear yes or no on it.",splattertaint,2022-11-11,00:34:11,2022,11,11,0,34,Friday
1,CatAdvice,Long car journey,"Hello! I have two babies, brother and sister, both neutered, age 7 years, they get along really well and love each other so much.

I am moving from Italy to the UK with my boyfriend and it's going to involve a long car trip. I've read loads about the best way to car travel with cats, but we are still uncertain about some details and what would be best for them. To be honest, I am really anxious because I want them to be as fine as possible.

To give a bit of background... They already moved twice, but each time it was just an hour drive. The first time was when I moved at my boyfriend's, then we stayed there for about a year; after that, the cats and I moved back with my mum but in a new house, and now after six months, we are going to join my boyfriend in the UK. They don't like moving, but the second move was better than the first one, they got used to the new place way faster. Instead, the second drive was a bit worse: they meowed all the time and Grey pissed himself. Between this two moves, we had to get them to a special vet for their passport, each drive back and forth was 30 mins, and going there Grey pissed and shit himself. The vet carrier is different than the ""move"" carrier, just to be clear. So, yes, Grey is the one that gets more stressed.

We found what we think would work best for them: staying in a carrier together (when they are together they are way more relaxed, even during a car travel), but they will have enough room to stay away from each other if they want to; I will sit in the back with them as we found that helps too; there is some cat music they particulary enjoy; we will use feliway too; and the vet prescribed us a relaxant. I am harness training them, and Grey is at a really good point, so maybe we will have also that option - I know some cats prefer to travel with the harness and leash on without being in the carrier, but I am not sure we will get to that point.

Our real dilemma - the reason of this post - is how to structure the drive itself. It is a 17 hr drive, with normal traffic and without considering pauses, so let's say 20. We are okay doing it in one go, and initially we thought it was maybe best for them - as they don't like new places generally - but now I am wondering if it wouldn't be better to stop for the night somewhere and do two shorter drives. I am afraid that in one go, they wouldn't use the litter and I don't want them to get an UTI.   
Grey just had struvite and calcium oxalate crystals one month ago, probably due to stress; he is totally fine now, he is taking a med (STIEN in Italy) to prevent it and they are also both eating the urinary care food. She had an UTI 2 years ago, non stress related. But you can see why I worry about this.  
At the same time, I am not even sure they would use the litter during the night stop, but maybe it's more likely?",krixi19,2022-11-11,00:28:30,2022,11,11,0,28,Friday

1,CatAdvice,My cat is peeing and pooping everywhere. Please help!,"Mt cat had this issue a few years ago, but it went away. Now it's come back with a vengeance.

My wife and I went on a trip for ten days. Luckily my mom lives close enough that she was able to watch my cat while we were gone. During the trip he started peeing and pooping out of his box, mostly on the living room floor. We assumed it was anxiety, but had him checked out with the vet when we returned just in case it was something else. The results came back normal.

This was a month and a half ago. Pretty much everyday we find a pee spot in the living room and it's starting to stain the hardwood. His litter box is being cleaned at least once a day, so we know it's not in reaction to a messy box. We've been spraying pheromones. There's been no major household or dietary changes for him.

Today he did the unthinkable and did it on the couch. My wife works for Twitter (still) and last week I suffered a minor stroke (I'm only 36 and in relatively good health) so needless to say since we've been back from our trip, we've been extremely stressed out. I'm starting to see my cat (that I've had for 7 years, since before I met my wife) as a nuisance more than my fluffy boy. Both of us are reaching our wits end with him.

1,CatAdvice,My cat's affection (or lack thereof),"We've had Freddy since he was a kitten. Even then he was never super snuggly, preferring to play and explore more than anything else. If course, if he was tired, he might sleep in your arms. But he didn't actively seek affection.

At about a year he started becoming affectionate. He would rub against your legs or hand, flop down and roll over to ask for belly rubs and you got to hear him purr a couple times a day anyway. He still wasn't like that all the time but you got enough of it. We used to pick him up all the time and while he didn't want to be held too long, he seemed content with it. Every once in a while he would purr a little while held, maybe knead on our arm a bit. I was happy with that.

But now, getting closer to two years, he's going back to preferring to be alone it seems. If he sees you, he'll raise his tail and you can pet his head a couple times and he clearly likes it. But no purrs, no flopping. If you pick him up, he goes stiff and will generally give a meow in protest within seconds. He seems FAR more prone right now to getting upset to the point of attacking. The only real times he seeks out affection now are when we go to the bathroom (he NEEDS to come in and he'll be all love-y for about 30 seconds) or when we go to bed he will come up between us, flop down and purr and be 100% affection. If we didn't have that, I'd be much more upset.

We did get a new kitten about a month ago which I could see contributing to his general curmudgeon-ness but his behavior started before that.

I'm not sure if there are any steps I can be taking to try to convince my Freddy to be a little more affectionate. If this is simply who he is then I can accept that - we'll love him all the same. But I just feel more disconnected from him now than I ever have.",MrSmock,2022-11-10,23:44:02,2022,11,10,23,44,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,One cat won’t get the hint the other cat doesn’t want to hang out,"I have had both my cats for seven years (adopted the male Milo at about one year old, the female Cordelia a few months later as a kitten).  Over the years it has become apparent that Cordelia does not enjoy socializing with Milo.  Milo is very friendly and energetic and Cordelia is more low key and not terribly playful.  I tend to see Cordelia as the dominant cat, as she always eats first (they have separate automatic feeders and when one goes off first she moves him right over without any protest), always gets the spot she wants, etc.  Over the past few months, Milo has increasingly wanted to play with Cordelia, but Cordelia is getting more and more irritated.  Milo is not showing any bullying behavior in the slightest and has never been aggressive, but will simply not get the hint when Cordelia gives him signals to back off, so she has resorted to hissing and batting, and has recently started to get extremely anxious and avoidant (going into the shower to poop even though they have two litter boxes in completely separate places, hiding), and they had their first full blown fight the other day because Cordelia attacked him.  I have spent so much time playing with Milo to try to get it out of his system, but all he wants to do is play with Cordelia, and I am at a total loss at this point as to what to do to curb his behavior because it is constant.  My next plan is to take Cordelia to the vet and see if there’s a medical issue contributing to her irritability and try to build up the cat architecture in my apartment as much as I can so that she has more places to run off to, but I’m more concerned about the fact that Milo will simply just not get the hint.  Does anyone have any input?  The only reading I’ve been able to find online is about aggressive cats and Milo is just not aggressive.",KlutzyElk7844,2022-11-10,21:16:30,2022,11,10,21,16,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,Which food is better? Grain free vs standard (two specific brands),"Hello,

I live in Estonia so there isn't usually a massive selection of different cat foods at more stores (for a reasonable price). My cat can be quite picky with most foods, flavors, even wet she will only eat the liquid etc. The one food she has seemed to enjoy for the last couple of years is Purina One Bifensis (beef flavour), but I recently came across a more natural/heathier looking brand for not much more money. I don't know much about grain free or cat nutrition but this new one seems better to me. I just wanted to know if it was worth the extra cost (only 15-20%).

Purina One:

**Ingredients:**  
Beef (16%), dried poultry protein, wheat (14%), soya meal, maize, maize gluten meal, animal fat, wheat gluten meal, dried beet pulp, dried chicory root, minerals, digest (with added heat treated Lactobacillus Delbrueckii and Fermentum powder 0.025%), yeast.

1,CatAdvice,My cat has a funny habit and I'm curious if anyone has an explanation for it,"I caught my 5-month-old kitten picking up one of his basic little mouse toys in his mouth and carrying it over to a small cardboard box.

He has done this several times now and I'm really amused and puzzled!  
Does anyone have an idea of what would inspire him to do this?

My guess is that maybe he just finds more enjoyment in throwing the mouse around in a small space and he figured out how to achieve this game, but I wonder if there is any actual explanation for this!

1.  I have a 15 year old blind dog, and although the kitten seems to like him and is actually trying to rub against him, my dog is not liking it. Bubba has a very sweet temperament and does not have an aggressive bone in his body.  But he has severe separation anxiety, and I was hoping that another animal in the house would help, but it has actually made it worse. I though Bubba was scared at first, but it seems like he genuinely does not like the kitten. Him being blind also means that he can't see the kitten and his body language. We've had many instances with the kitten wanting to play with bubba, or even getting aggressive with bubba because he isn't paying attention to him. I can tell that bubba is getting increasingly stressed and is not liking our situation at all. I've had him since he was a puppy, and I know him well enough to say that him warming up to the kitten would take more than time. I honestly think that Bubba might be jealous or something...
2. Time is also another issue. I already knew that kitten would have a lot of energy, so I tried to prepare to be available to play with him for around four or five 15-30 minute increments throughout the day. But even after we are done playing, he seems to keep bouncing off the walls. During these times he also is attacking bubba out of excitement. He is so cute, and I enjoy playing with him sometimes, but most of the time it feels like a chore. As time goes on it is becoming harder and harder for me to enjoy playing with him and giving him attention... I feel so terrible saying that when he is so sweet and he can't help his energy level! 
3. I've noticed patchy rashes on my legs that appears to be contact dermatitis. I am very prone to skin allergies, so I take a morning and a night allergy medication and I have learned what causes my allergies so I only use skin products that I know I'm not allergic to. I noticed these rashes a couple days after getting the kitten, and I can't say for certain but I think I might be allergic to him... I haven't changed anything in my routine except for him. I'm really sad just thinking about the possibility that I am allergic.
4. This isn't fair to the kitten, and I don't really know why I'm adding this, but I have a lot of plants that I care about and I am so scared that he is either going to get sick from them or he is going to kill them. I am currently in the process of segregating most of them to one room and hanging the rest up high. But from what my friends have told me about cats, its that they will find a way to get up there if they are motivated enough. He has already managed to get on top of my fridge! I really can't give away or sell most of my plants since they are family heirlooms...

**TLDR: Overall the biggest reasons I am on the fence is because my blind senior dog seems to be really stressed and shows no signs of warming up, and I am developing skin rashes possibly because I am allergic to the kitten. I know that people say that time will tell, but I don't want to make the kitten grow more attached to us and have him suffer by taking him back to the shelter. But after doing a lot of research I am also worried about the kitten not finding a good home to adopt him. I just really don't know what to do. I keep thinking that our lives would be back to normal and be easy and calm again. But I feel so guilty for thinking that way. I want to believe that he would find a good home since he is so sweet and cuddly, but I have no way to know...**

&amp;#x200B;

*I am going to try to go to the doctor soon to try and see if I'm allergic to cats or maybe something else (liter maybe?). And if I'm not, and I decided to take the kitten back to the rescue, would it be stupid of me to try to adopt an older cat instead? I thought that a kitten would better adapt to our home, but now I'm thinking that maybe Bubba would warm up to an adult cat more? I don't know though. If anyone has been through something similar I would love some advice.*",DedicatedTeddybear99,2022-11-10,13:51:51,2022,11,10,13,51,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,First-time kitten owner needing some direction,"Hi!! First-time kitten owner here, adopted my 7 week old baby about a week ago! Struggling with a couple things and would love some advice:

1. he CONSTANTLY is play-attacking my hands and feet. Like, I can't even get up without him pouncing and his energy bursts last hours. I've always been trying to redirect his attention and hand him toys, but he still prefers my hands and feet. I've also tried letting out little yelps, but to no avail. How do I curb this habit? I've read that ""ignoring"" works, but what does that mean? just let him bite? 
2. I'm slightly discouraged by all the research I'm doing about single cats. It makes me feel like I'm gonna grow up with a lonely, aggressive cat no matter what I do unless I adopt a companion. Can I hear some success stories from someone about a single kitty who outgrew the biting kitten phase and is doing just fine? 
3. Theres been 3 occasions where he's done a short ""Hiss"" at me while playing. Is that normal? I don't know if I can classify it as a hiss but I don't know what else to call it

I've been doing a lot of research and trying my best to learn a lot early on to give him the happiest home environment! Any advice from experienced cat parents would be so appreciated :) I will def update this with more questions eventually because I'm bound to have some.",earthtotala,2022-11-10,13:04:30,2022,11,10,13,4,Thursday
1,CatAdvice,Trying to figure out if my cat is happy or distressed during my separation.,"So, I separated from my husband. My cat has always been “my cat,” not his. My cat gives me about 80% of affection and sleeps with me every night.

Anyhow, since the separation, my cat seems happier? Thrilled when I come home (zooms around the house and constantly flops for belly rubs), snuggles me 5x more, stays constantly near me, and has become so talkative! He happily trills as we play and purrs louder than ever before.

Is this his way of coping? Is he trying to comfort me? Or is he genuinely just happier?",KindheartednessSad55,2022-11-10,12:51:53,2022,11,10,12,51,Thursday
1,CatAdvice,How do I keep both of my cats happy?,"Starting note: I actually have three cats, but the third (Harley) isn't super relevant here; she doesn't get along super great with either of my other two but she mostly ignores them so it's not a big deal.

This is about my other two cats - Asuka (female, 4, spayed, tuxedo) and Gawain (male, 4, neutered, white). Asuka has always had anxiety issues but they've skyrocketed since we adopted Gawain, to the point where she's sequestered herself to the second floor of our apartment and we've had to start feeding her separately because she won't come down even for food. 

Gawain was found on the streets with a number of injuries, sad and hurting, and immediately attached himself to us. We helped him recover. He has never been anything but sweet to Asuka; when she hisses at him he sits down and slow blinks at her. He tries to play with her occasionally, which she hates. If he dares to come anywhere near her she hisses, swats, scratches; when we're out of the house and can't separate them sometimes we'll come home to find he has a new scratch on his ear or nose.

Asuka was our first cat together; we've had her for almost her whole life. Feliway doesn't help. We've been considering taking her to the vet for possible anxiety medication because her anxiety levels around Gawain are just not rational. And she's hurting him, and that's hardly fair to him.

This has turned into a ramble - basically, I love both of these cats and they are both incredibly attached to us. Rehoming either is not an option. But the current situation is not fair to either of them and I'm not sure how to proceed outside of the aforementioned anxiety meds thing. What else can we do to possibly help Asuka calm down and stop hurting Gawain?",Kouunno,2022-11-10,12:46:12,2022,11,10,12,46,Thursday
1,CatAdvice,Young male cat is suddenly incontinent?,"I’m going to the vet first thing in the morning, but I thought I’d ask here because I’m a pretty new cat owner and I haven’t experienced this. My new cat is a 1 year and 3mo old male, and he has his own room while I introduce him to my 4 yo female. 

Yesterday I noticed him crouching strangely, but thought nothing of it, and today I got home to little drops of pee all around the room, with his litter box full of scattered little pees. I put him in the bathroom temporarily to clean up, and he was still leaking on the bathroom floor, as though he was incontinent, but he’s still a baby :(

He’s eating and drinking and behaving normally, it just looks like he can’t hold it in, and like he constantly needs to go, like maybe a UTI? 

I’ve had some trouble with introducing the two cats these past 2 months as well, as he seems more dominant than my older cat and likes to swat at her when I have them interact. He also doesn’t like being stuck in the room even though I let him explore the house everyday, he scratches at the door and I know not to give him attention when he does that, I don’t know when he’ll get the message that it doesn’t work, I just hope I’m doing things correctly :’) 
So I’m also wondering if it could also be stress related because of that.. 

Any advice or expertise is appreciated, if anyone’s had something similar. My female cat’s had urinary crystal issues and she’s on a urinary diet, so that’s the only experience I’ve had but it doesn’t seem the same.",gabrielletddd,2022-11-10,12:44:18,2022,11,10,12,44,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,How to help my cat with separation anxiety… but not from me.,"So my handsome little void, Arlo (3 years old, neutered male) is having some adjustment issues with recently moving (my partner and I moved from A cramped one bedroom apartment, to a now much more spaced out 2 bedroom, single floor, with our own private staircase to get to our floor). One of which is is separation anxiety is kicked into overdrive. But, he’s not anxious being away from me; it’s with my partner. My partner works nights, and Arlo does not like that. He will cry and cry at the door for hours. 

I have tried everything you can imagine. Coaxing him away from the stairs with treats; distracting him with a variety of toys for 10, even 20 minutes straight; putting “cat videos” on tv… nothing works. My concern is getting a noise complaint from my neighbours, since we’re the “new guys” it’s more likely that we will be picked on. How can I get my boy to calm down at night while my partner is away?

My mom gives her some of it mixed in with her regular food but now she just picks out the pieces she wants and leaves the rest. I don't really want to be feeding her that. I've done research into what she should be eating, and I see wet food is the best for weight loss but she just won't eat it. I want her to be healthy, but I don't want to starve her.

1,CatAdvice,My poor sick is scared of me after giving her meds. Mega guilt.,"My cat is 13 and has an (the vet thinks) UTI. I have to give her antibiotics, via liquid syringe, two times a day.

And the only way I can get medicine in her is to just go to her when she is relaxing and sorta force it on her. Today she spit it out, scratched my arm up and has been hiding.

I am supposed to do this for 10 days and I am seriously concerned that it will wreck our bond. 

How can I avoid this? I am giving her space but, man, this seriously hurts. I feel so guilty. I don't have anyone to help me hold her and I also can't sneak it into her food (she can smell it and won't eat).

1,CatAdvice,Is my male cat attracted to me?,"So this is a weird question but it seems to be a weird behavior(to me at least) that he's exhibiting. My male cat is about 9 months old and he hasn't been neutered yet(moving, timing and costs), he's also pretty big for his age, I'd say a pound or 3 more than the average cat his age. he's always been affectionate more so than any cat I've met, more like a dog. He loves cuddles, specifically when he's got his two front arms wrapped around my neck like a hug and I hold him in my arms, he also gives kisses. At first I thought maybe it was the smell of food on my mouth because that's where he likes to lick, basically only my lips unless he can't get to them then he licks my face. As he's gotten older he's gotten more intense about it, trying to force me into it. He's started rubbing his lower area against me until he well.. releases, so I've had to start removing him from me when he starts to grab tighter but he'll bite my neck and won't let go. I know this behavior is because of puberty but he doesn't do it to anyone else except for recently we found a 2-3 month old female kitten on the streets and he's been treating her in a similar way. I just want to know if it's solely because he's going through puberty and this is what all unneutered male cats do to female humans when not around fertile female cats, if he has some weird unnatural attraction to me, or if it has nothing to do with attraction and it's because he's just used to cuddles and now associates cuddles with pleasure.",Top-Proposal8960,2022-11-10,07:51:40,2022,11,10,7,51,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,2-3 week old kitten orphan advice,"My wife and I just adopted a kitten that's somewhere between 2-3 weeks old (mother couldn't be found and it was crying in the rain) we've seen a vet and got some advice from them, but I still had some more questions.

Just to lay out her situation: We took her to a vet within 30 minutes of receiving her, the vet wiped her once and she let out so much that the vet was shocked, but said it seems she's starting to get it all out and she should be okay, but to come back if she has any stomach issues. She also received a dewormer.

She's been bottle fed the last 3 days (tomorrow is scheduled to be her first day on wet food + KMR formula mixed according to the vet) 

Her sleep situation is we have a walk in closet separate from any of our other animals, we have her in a box in there with a puppy pad and a fluffy blanket, so the ambient temperature is higher than the main house and she can stay warm.

Questions:

1) Her butt has been pretty red since that initial wiping at the vet (and following huge expel) - is this okay? It seems _less_ inflamed but I'm worried Im just inflaming it more when I wipe her.

2) For wiping her so she can go to the restroom, how long should we wipe? We've been trying to use baby wipes, are these okay? I bought cat wipes but they say ""not for internal use"" which worried me about wiping her with them.

I don't wanna wipe too long and inflame her even longer, but I also don't want her stuffed up cause I didn't do it right.

Our vet instructed us to do it once per meal, and so far she pees after every meal but doesn't poop most the time 
(maybe 1-2 times a day? sometimes in her box, even though she didnt go during a feeding, which requires cleaning everything out and remaking it)

3) When she cries for food, we feed her, and she'll usually drinks a lot which is good, but then she stops. 

She then starts sitting there crying, but if we give her the bottle back she maybe suckles a tiny bit then spits it out again. 

Holding her doesnt seem to help, and neither does letting her walk around a bit seemingly, if we put her back in her box and in the warm closet she'll cry MUCH louder and climb towards us until we close the door and let her cry herself out - she then falls asleep.

Is anything wrong with that? I can't find info on kittens in this age group crying beyond ""They cry for food"" but she doesn't want the food, so I'm just not sure what else to do but get her to sleep?

4) Is there anything stimulating we should be doing for her? 

Right now the process has been:
Wait until 3-4 hours has passed since last feeding, or she cries -&gt; Feed her until she stops accepting the bottle -&gt; try and let her walk around or climb on us a bit to work on her muscles and coordination -&gt; put her back in her box in the closet and let her sleep till next feeding or she cries again

Is there anyway we should be playing with her? or stimulating her? I want her to learn how to walk and play when she's supposed to, and she seems interested in walking around, but she's also uncoordinated and falls over a lot, and shakes when she holds herself up too long.

5) Her back legs/tail are kinda grimy, they feels wet most the time and have that sorta ""stiff"" feeling.

I took a washcloth and some unscented dawn to it and its a tiny bit better, but not ideal, is there anything better I could be doing?

We weren't sure if she should be bathed or not at this point.",EmperorZergg,2022-11-10,05:36:58,2022,11,10,5,36,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,"Cat suddenly stopped eating kibble, but will still scarf down kibble-like hard treats (ex. Temptations) and wet food","I noticed that the auto feeder bowl has been accumulating kibble, which means my cat hasn’t been touching it. This is very unusual because she normally would run to her feeder when she heard the kibble clinking down. For some context:

My cat gets fed from the auto feeder 3x a day, and some wet food at night (all small portions, I’ve done the calorie math). Several weeks ago I was out of town for a week and my roommates took care of my cat. They told me that they noticed that my cat wouldn’t eat from the kibble bowl sometimes so we kinda chalked it up to separation anxiety from me. She got better when I came back home and things were back to normal for a while, and then this past week we had a few guests over so she got more treats than usual, both hard and soft treats. Now she’s avoiding her kibble altogether, so I’ve been adding some cat-safe tuna/chicken toppings to entice her to eat but she’ll kinda fish around her bowl. 

I read online that it could be dental pain, but she’s still eating her wet food and hard treats just fine. I’ve tried an all-wet diet but it was really hard for me (she’s wake me and my partner up at 4am every morning so the auto feeder made my life and mental health so much better). Is it possible that she’s just tired of her kibble now?",solovelee,2022-11-10,04:52:42,2022,11,10,4,52,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,Cat refuses affection,"As the title says, my new cat is not affectionate at all. To give some context, my bf had a British shorthair since she was a kitten until she was about 1 years old. Due to work and other personal reasons, he decided to give her away. He stayed in contact with the person who took his cat and we suspect she wasn’t the nicest to the cat (periodically asking him to take her back but only if he paid a lot of money etc). After months of discussing with my bf about taking her back, he finally did so after the two of them spent 2 years apart. 

As I’m writing this she’s somewhere upstairs roaming around the house on her first days here. She is very shy with us, refuses to be pet or picked up. However, she does come when we call her name so I take that as a good sign? She seems quite curious about us and always watches us if we do something.

I think I’ve been lucky until now because I’ve only had extremely cuddly and affectionate cats and now I have no idea how to act around her. I know we’re still in the beginning but I’m just worried that she’ll never get to truly like us and let her pet her, let alone sleep in our lap or do anything remotely affectionate.

1,CatAdvice,Clingy Stray Kitten,"I recently brought home a stray kitten. She is about 3 months old according to the vet and had a dislocated paw when I found her. She's absolutely adorable and I plan on keeping her. 


The only problem is she's really clingy. She will meow and rub herself against me constantly when awake and follows me around. I try petting her but its like she's never satisfied? I've only ever had dogs so I don't know how to deal with cats at all. Is this normal behavior? I work from home so sometimes its hard to give her my full attention. Is there any way I can keep her entertained without involving myself? 

Also I keep her in my room all the time. Should I be taking her outside like you do with dogs? Or are kittens completely fine w being indoors all the time? 

Since I work from home, I'm also worried about her developing sepertion anxiety since she's so affectionate? I'll be moving back to office next year and don't want her to suffer. Can I do something to avoid that?

She's a really good kitty, I didn't even have to teach her how to use the litter but I'm worried she feels sad when I'm busy working or too tired to play with her. 

I know these might be stupid questions but I've really never dealth with cats before.  I'd appreciate ANY help.",aloobiryani,2022-11-10,02:34:06,2022,11,10,2,34,Thursday
1,CatAdvice,What gender (3rd cat) to add to a group of 2 female cats?,"Hi all,

I have two female cats (both neutered) one of 14 years old another of 7months old (not related). They get along really well and my older cat even enjoys playing a bit more since they have been introduced. 
Soon I will adopt a 3rd cat (kitten) from a friend's litter. However I am not sure what the best addition could be another (neutered) female or a male? 

I am inclined to go for a female because they are usually calmer I've noticed from experience and don't stray to far away from our garden. However another person told me too many females together will not work (I don't know if 3 is considered too many)

1,CatAdvice,Cats not getting along,"Hi all. I have a 1 yo female cat named Peanut and my bf has a 5 yo female cat named Martini. BF and Martini moved into my house a little over 2 months ago and our cats are still not getting along.

We kept Martini in a bedroom by herself when she first came over and still do bc of the issues we’re having. We did the Jackson Galaxy method of introduction. 

We’ve gotten to a point where both cats can be in the same room together and things mostly go well. They can both sit on the couch in peace. They were even face to face the other day (although that ended with Martini hissing, but I believe she is scared of Peanut). We give them treats and play with Peanut (Martini is not very interested in toys). 

Here’s our issue - anytime Martini gets off of the couch and starts walking around/goes outside the bedroom to explore, Peanut stares her down and chases her. Martini runs to hide under another couch and will hiss and growl at Peanut. There has been swatting/hissing on both sides but so far no major fighting with fur flying/blood. 

I try to use treats or toys to distract Peanut when I see her staring Martini down but 9/10 times it doesn’t last long and she ends up chasing. We have tried calming treats and spray - that didn’t work. Currently trying a calming collar on Peanut but so far I haven’t seen a huge difference. 

We’re both at our wits end. It seems like Peanut is being aggressive and chases her down to attack her. It’s like she’s saying to Martini “Hey why are you going out there? That’s my territory.” We feel bad for Martini having to mostly be confined to this bedroom when she clearly wants to go out and explore, but we are too afraid of them fighting for real. We don’t know how much, if any, interactions either cat had with other cats before. One of my thoughts is maybe Peanut was never taught how to properly interact with other cats. 

Are we overreacting? Is this just normal behavior? Do we need to restart the intro process? Both cats have been to the vet in recent months and are fine. We don’t know what else to try. I just want Peanut to understand that Martini is not a threat but nothing we’re doing is stopping the chasing.",happypeanut456,2022-11-10,02:16:41,2022,11,10,2,16,Thursday

Today, I was looking for her frantically because she wasn’t in her usual spots and she never hides so I’m automatically assuming something is wrong. I go into my pantry and she has absolutely devoured a Kellogg’s cereal box, but none of the cereal. Mind you she had food, (Taste of The Wild Salmon &amp; Venison) and water. Completely ignored the cereal like it didn’t exist and went straight to tearing the box up. I’m going to also assume she probably ate a good bit of it, so I’m going to make an appointment but I was just wondering, is it some type of deficiency? I mean obviously she has Pika but I she has never been this ravenous. Any advice?

1,CatAdvice,Looking for some advice RE: one of our outdoor “feral” cats,"TLDR: Outdoor boy cat is stressing out our formerly outdoor girl cat - should we adopt out the boy cat, or is there a better solution?

Some backstory: About six months ago, 5 kittens turned up in our backyard (2 boys, 3 girls). We successfully TNR’d all 5 babies, and have been feeding them twice daily ever since. The 2 boys and 1 of the girls have been extremely affectionate and accepting of human interaction since day one. 
About a month ago, one of the boys went missing and hasn’t returned. We think he was able to find a family that took him in with them and now he’s living the good life indoors. 
With one cat down, we began becoming very attached to these cats, the most being with the runt of the pack, one of the girls. The other boy was just as affectionate - they would come into our sun room every night for pets and snuggles. While they should be technically deemed feral cats, they never struck us as such, because they were so accepting of human touch and would come up to us with no hesitation. 
Our favorite, the runt girl, all of a sudden turned up with a scrape on her nose. This sent us into a tizzy and, in order to prevent her nose getting any worse, she was moved indoors with us. She’s now been to the vet, her nose is fully healed, and she’s a new member of our family. 
Since she has come inside to live with us, the remaining boy has begun yowling outdoors at night. He has scaled our house to get to our bedroom windowsill, and hangs from the screens on our window on our sunroom, all while meowing very loudly. It’s very distressing for both our cat and us. We thought perhaps they just missed each other, so we let him back into our sunroom so they could be together, but they didn’t show any interest in being together. It seems that he just wants to be inside with us as well - I’m not sure if the yowling is territorial or jealous.

My question is - do you think it would be okay at this point to try and adopt the boy out? Or would it cause more harm than good? I think he is destined for the indoor life and would be great at it. At this time we are not able to accommodate them both living inside with us. Or is there a different solution we should consider? Would no longer feeding them encourage to move on from our yard? Any advice is appreciated - thanks!",dadadevy,2022-11-09,22:47:17,2022,11,9,22,47,Wednesday
1,CatAdvice,Litter box location,"Hi everyone, my cat Pigeon and I just moved two weeks ago. The first night we were here I kept her in a bathroom until she used the litter box and then allowed her into my room. Cue the stoping of the litter box usage. 
Once she peed on my bed I knew it was a UTI and she has gotten her antibiotics from the vet ( they did a urinalysis to confirm). I had her in the bathroom again during the waiting period to have the sample tested and such. 
After getting her antibiotics she used the litter box again that day. So I put her back in my room and allowed her to wander around the house (supervised) for a little bit. At bedtime I put her in my room with me and then woke up to her peeing on her couch, so I moved her back to the bathroom with her litter box- the litter box had been moved to my room. 

This morning l went to the bathroom and she had peed in the litter box since putting her in the bathroom with it. Do I need to just keep her in the bathroom for a few days to allow her time to settle down? I can’t keep the litter box in that bathroom forever, it’s too small of a bathroom for it as is and it’s the only one with a working shower right now.

1,CatAdvice,Kitten prefers laser pointer over wand,"Me again, sorry for rapid posting but I had another question regarding Friday, our 5 month old tuxedo cat.

So as I mentioned, she's at the age where she's super into everything and still has that kitten energy. She'll get zoomies and run around the house, meowing like crazy, which is a good sign she needs to be played with. I work from home so I try to play with her fairly consistently, 2 times a day about 30-45 minutes per session with food immediately after. Lately though, I found she's been pretty uninterested with her wand and prefers a laser pointer.

I bought a retractable wand off Amazon and it came with a ton of attachments. I've also just buy her new ones whenever I see them so needless to say we have a ton to work with. I have feathers, worms, mice, and even a bee. And for a little bit, she'll love it. She'll stalk it, chase it, I let her catch it; usual stuff. But after maybe after 2-3 play sessions she'll just have no interest in it whatsoever. She'll just casually walk away and play with something else while I'm standing here, trying my hardest to convince her this is prey.

We also bought her a laser pointer toy, which both me and my girlfriend were a little skeptical at first. We've both heard it messes with cat's heads since they physically can't catch a dot so it might be frustrating for them. Originally I bought it as a tool, rather than a toy. Jackson Galaxy mentioned that it's good to ""wind-up"" cats to play with physical toys, which is what I'd try to do. I'd also use it as a redirection toy, something to take away her attention from something I don't want her to play with. But after being fed up with her not playing with the wand, I whipped out the laser pointer and got her to play for a solid session. She looked satisfied, was panting and purring, and like I said it was the most consistently engaged I've seen her play in a while. The thing is I'm still on the fence on whether or not I should continue to use the laser over wand. To put it bluntly I feel like I'm giving her the kitten playtime equivalent to crack, just feels extreme and I don't want her sense of play to be warped because of it.

My question is what alternatives to the wand that are still remote (cat on one end, me on the other) would you recommend? I think the message Friday's sending to me is that she's bored of the wand, but I know if supplementing it with kitty crack (laser pointer) is the right way to go.",erpkins3,2022-11-09,22:25:35,2022,11,9,22,25,Wednesday
1,CatAdvice,Cat won’t stop scooting,"Hey everyone, I am having an issue with my cat scooting and not sure how to address it. 

For context, she is a healthy, 2 year old orange tabby. Back in February, she started pooping outside of the litter box, mostly on rugs. I took her to the vet and they didn’t find any issues, said it was behavioral. It lasted for a few months and was quite frustrating because I didn’t know why she started doing this. I changed her food, moved the litter box, got a bigger litter box, etc.. all the things I researched that could solve the issue, I tried. Nothing seemed to work. I took her to the vet again and they did a deeper analysis; still nothing was wrong with her. I ended up having to get rid of all the rugs in my apartment and switched to a cat-attracting litter, and that seemed to work. She now goes in the litter box consistently, yay! 

However, she is still having an issue with scooting. After she goes in the litter box, she will wipe her butt on my blankets/couch/floor.. mostly in soft spots (blankets on my bed 😞). She never used to do this before she started having the litter box issues. It really seems like she just doesn’t want to clean her butt herself anymore. 

Anyone know what could be going on and how to fix it? Thanks!",niki_01,2022-11-09,22:20:45,2022,11,9,22,20,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,How do I get my cat to stop ripping up the carpet? I have tried everything,"Seriously, how do I get him to stop?

We have two area rugs and most of the time they are almost completely covering with cat toys, tunnels and beds, and lots and lots of cat scratchers. All different types, some horizontal, some at an incline and some vertical. Cardboard, sisal, and carpet-covered scratchers as well. We even bought that ripple mat that is huge, blocks off most of the rug in the living room, and is almost the same exact texture as the living room rug. 

My cat REFUSES to stop scratching up the carpet. At this point I think he’s doing it to torture me because he’ll scratch up the carpet RIGHT BESIDE a scratch pad. Like I’m not kidding, front of toes touching the ripple mat or a sisal scratcher as he just fucking goes for it on the carpet. I’m losing my mind. I don’t even care that much about the rug it’s that he’s being so goddamn mean about it! I try to give him praise when he uses anything that is acceptable but there’s no way of stopping him from scratching that doesn’t scare him or potentially mess with me training him to use the millions of scratchers I have provided. 

Like I’m telling y’all, I have 90% of this rug covered with scratchers and he will find the one spot uncovered to rip up. I’m losing my mind please any advice is helpful.

We quickly learnt that the neighbours next door had abandoned her after their dog tried to attack the cat, they also mistreated her and made no effort to get Remi to return. We slowly adjusted her to our apartment and initially she'd spend a few hours inside and the rest of the day outside (sadly though we live near a busy street that's filled with rats, so it already wasn't the safest).

We adjusted her to indoor life by slowly trusting her alone, and giving her lots of attention and letting her sleep during the day. Then we would keep her inside during work hours because it tends to get rainy in autumn. What made me realise she should be kept indoors fully though was aside from the fact we realised the places she'd go to were kind of filthy, we also caught her a few times nearly crawling inside the open window of those awful neighbours who almost got her killed (this became especially common the last week or so).

The first time we tried to keep her inside at night was in July, but she kept meowing/crying which made us relent and let her go outside. But last night was the first night she stayed inside 24 hours, and although she did meow a few times, she would usually after 5 minutes just move on and relax as if she didn't care anymore. I did stuff like play with her, allow her to climb and roam the apartment, as well as putting livestreams of birds and mice on the TV to help stimulate her. And I was able to sleep the whole night without any disturbance from her.

What I want to know is, is this good progress? I know some cats can get depressed or stressed staying inside whilst some cats can adjust absolutely fine, and I want to make sure she's happy and content.",Pineapple_Forward,2022-11-09,21:00:40,2022,11,9,21,0,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,Constantly crying and waking me up,"Preface with this is my first cat.

He’s an orange 2.75 y/o rescue, named Chip. The issue is that he is extremely good driven (there’s no leave for later with him), and wants food all the time. I have an auto-feeder for the mornings in the hope that he’d start going toward that rather than crying at me, but he has been waking me up 2+ hours before my alarm since it’s “food o clock.” This wasn’t as severe before DST this past weekend, so I’m hoping in a bit it’s back to 1+ hours but not betting on it. 

Currently, the morning food is split into two servings about 40 minutes apart. I’m debating starting even earlier with the smallest possible portion and spacing them out, but I also don’t want him to be used to the idea that food comes at 4am. 

Most importantly, I want the last 2 hours of sleep back. Generally he is healthy and fine. He just likes food and loves letting me know he should eat or he might actually drop dead.",DrKenShu,2022-11-09,20:18:31,2022,11,9,20,18,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,Keeping calm when my pet is at vet?,"This might be a silly question but does anyone have advice on staying calm when your pet is spending all day at the vet? My cat has been unwell. She is anemic, has jaundice, suspected liver issue, and the vet could feel some lumps in her intestines and suspected lymphoma. We tried steroids/antibiotics and although her temperature came down and the lumps did seem to lessen, she's still very yellow and needs an ultrasound to confirm whether this is cancer, or some kind of blockage/inflammation. 

She is 13 so not exactly young and she gets very anxious. She's a clingy little thing who never leaves my side (more now that she's unwell). I'm nervous about her being at the vet all day for bloodwork and the ultrasound scan. She might need to be sedated for it. I don't know how I'm going to cope leaving here there without being a mess all day. I've put her through so much lately taking her to the vet multiple times and giving her five pills a day. Any advice or support on how to stay calm when she goes in would be really appreciated.

1,CatAdvice,Replacement Pump for Catit Pixi Fountain,"So I have been realising that maybe buying a water fountain because it is cute and looks like a cat, is less of a selling point than learning all of how it functions and how to make that work best.

After not being able to get the filters for a while but still running the fountain and even before that the pump just getting so clogged so quickly, it had lead to some built up of slime etc. I’m not the greatest at home care and had just learned a method of sanitising plastic bottles home mixture and boiling water. Because of the build up on and through the pump I thought yeah put the pump in there too to clean that. I however am consented that I have affected the back rubber/plastic(?) where the cable comes out.

I was wondering if anyone knew if anywhere there might be someone who sold a 3rd party pump that would attach for the Pixi. Especially if it had a particulate filter built in (replaceable) so that and stuff that gets past the Pixi filters don’t get into the pump.

1,CatAdvice,a new kitten and my 10 years old cat,"We thought it would have been a good idea to get a new kitten (Oliver) to be a companion for my 10 years old cat (Sophie); we also have a big house which felt kinda empty, so this also played in our decision to adopt a kitten. We picked a cat of the opposite sex in hopes this would recude intial hostility. 
We are following ""introducing a new kitten"" protocols: Oliver has its own room for now where he sleeps and spends parts of the day. He's been here less than a week and I know it takes time, especially with a cat that has established routines and a certain character like Sophie - she is very quiet, likes to nap, while Oliver at 3 months old is a savage.
I would say it's not even going bad: when we are home and can supervise them, Sophie is always overseeing what he does as he plays and randomly runs around, the hissing and the growling on her part are tuning down as well and she is starting to relax a little (aka going back to sleep, sort of) if he doesn't get too close.
I'd like to add that this is what the vet told us to do - after the first 3-4 days where Oliver has stayed mostly in his room, where all of his needs are met of course, to let them interact and just let it sort itself out.

The doubt I have and the reason for me to ask for advice is this: whenever Oliver decides it's time to force socialization, he'll try to play with Sophie by hiding and doing little ambushes and following her around; Sophie responds to this by hissing and trotting away, pissed; she swatted at him only a couple times, no claws involved. Considering how she reacts, would you say this'll fix itself over time or do we need to change strategy? Most of all, is this too stressful for Sophie? The moment he's gone to his room she is back to being our laid back vocal Sophie.

1,CatAdvice,my neighbor's cat has been staying with me at night,"Here's the story:

Last summer when it was warm one night I had the door open, and a kitten came into my house.  I didn't know whose it was but it looked healthy, so I gave it a little tuna and let it stay with me for awhile.  It left in the early am, a few weeks went by and then I saw it in my neighbor's window.  The window was closed but soon after they started leaving it open in the day so the cat could go outside.

After awhile he started popping up again occasionally at my place when I left my door open, usually just to say hi and walk around a bit.  Sometimes I give him treats, he isn't overweight and he's quite vocal when he wants one.  But I also noticed sometimes he'd be meowing outside my next door neighbor's door (not the cat owner) looking to get invited in by them as well.  Since I often leave my own door open for air flow, when I hear him meowing even if my door is shut I'll open it and see if he wants to come in.  He usually hangs out for awhile checking out the corners and nooks then leaves.

Lately he's been doing it a lot more often.  Last night it was pouring rain and barely above freezing.  I normally never see him in the evenings, I assumed he went home to his family and a warm bed.  But it was very late (after midnight) and he was meowing so miserably so I let him in to get warm.  He pretty much instantly jumped on my couch and nestled between my legs on top of my blanket, where he stayed until morning.  I left the door open for him even though it was cold, and he left just before dawn.

The next day I asked a different neighbor who said the cat gets left out every night.  He was at my door again tonight and much earlier, so once again I let him in and he jumped on the couch to purr and take a nap while nestled against me for warmth.  Now he's fast asleep in my armchair and I plan to give him a safe space to sleep out of the elements whenever he wants.

It clearly wants a nice place to be comfy at night, but is giving shelter to someone else's cat like the pet version of home wrecking?  I don't feel bad at all, if anything I think the owners are not doing a good job by forcing it outdoors especially in bad weather.  Still, I'm hoping the reddit community has some insight that might help!",sfweedman,2022-11-09,15:13:42,2022,11,9,15,13,Wednesday

He greets people and is super affectionate then decides to lunge, grab arm, and bite. It makes me sad because it makes me feel like a bad pet parent.

While for the most part he’s doing it to initiate play, I am extremely consistent in not rewarding him with any attention. For a month I tried firm NO, walk away, ignore. No luck. Light bop on the head, didn’t work. Another month, I tried hissing (he will release his bite), walk away, ignore. It worked for a bit and stopped working. 

I’ve had him for 4 months now and been attempting to correct his behavior and feel like a failure.

1,CatAdvice,How much activity should I be letting my cat with heart failure have? Can he still take the stairs and jump?,"I have a 16.5yr old cat with CKF and CHF. I know this sounds bad, our vet has kind of been pushing to have us put him down asap, but we don't believe it's quite the time yet. He sleeps, eats, drinks, poops, and pees quite normally, some weight loss (he is 9lbs). The problem is he is a very active cat, he likes to sleep with us so he keeps jumping on and off the bed (we have a ramp but he doesn't use it all the time), he likes to be with his humans so if we go downstairs and upstairs, he follows. He also likes to play his scratching post everyday. I see so much life in him that it doesn't quite feel right to just put him down in a few days. 

  
However, since he has just been diagnosed with CHF our vet has told us to keep him in a room with no bed and let him just stay there to minimize his activities as to not strain his heart? He has a lot of fluid in his chest that is making it heavy to breath, just started Salix so hopefully that helps. We don't want to put him down just yet, but staying in one room sounds like a terrible way for him to enjoy the rest of his life... 

Our plan for now is to try and limit his activities to upstairs only, any advice? Should I let him live his fullest while he still can?",Comfortable-Bill-581,2022-11-09,13:01:04,2022,11,9,13,1,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,Is this a normal interaction or should these two be separated?,"Video in link. Separated at end as black one seemed a bit vicious and orange one looked like he was trying to escape and failing.

Orange cat is 1.5 years, black one is 7 months. Don’t live in same household. Introduced correctly when black kitten was about 15 weeks. They see each other around twice a week maximum. Always in orange cats house. They always fight, rarely sit peacfullly with each other. During fights, occasional hissing and meowing. Orange one sometimes runs away and black one pursues constantly. We have put a lead on black one at times so he can’t chase orange one, sometimes orange one initiates fights but also spends a lot more time at a distance when black one is restricted. When door shut between them orange one will paw at door and meow for the other one. 

Unsure if this is normal or if they shouldn’t be allowed together? Worried that maybe black one is terrorising orange one?

1,CatAdvice,I believe my one cat is sad due to his friend's death but I don't know,"About three weeks ago my families one cat named Isis became sick and soon passed a week later suddenly. It was awful and still makes me cry but our other cat Red I believe is understanding that Isis isn't coming back. We got Red young and he loved playing, sleeping and just being with Isis even though Isis preferred to be alone she tolerated it.

Since there's a age are a bit a part Red is around 5 now and we never had any other pet pass away.  When my mother brought Isis ashes back home Reds behavior has become more like Isis. He sleep in her chair always leaving room for her and  kinda just wants to be alone, although I just adopted a new kitten 5 months ago who always wants to play with him and bother him. 

But the behavior I'm questioning is he now comes downstairs just to rest or he wants to sleep near me which is very new, but he doesn't really interact with me he just loafs at the end of my bed not doing anything. Just earlier I found him loafing on the bathroom mat which he never goes into the washroom. Plus my kitty Nyx basically has the downstairs as her Domain so I don't really understand.

1,CatAdvice,Newly rescued adult cat advice and reassurance,"I recued a gorgeous 4yr old cat from the shelter 5 days ago. He was immediately very affectionate and seemed much more comfortable with me around. As soon as I'd call him he'd come out of his hiding place (under the bed is his favourite) and come out for lots of pats, head boops and cuddles. 

He was found on the street, and moved between shelters a lot. I live in a busy inner city apartment and he seems to be very nervous of the sounds of the city. Dogs barking and cars especially. I've been playing Music for Cats by David Teiei which seems to help. 

My issue is, two nights ago He got brave and went exploring the rest of the house at night. He accidentally knocked a plate down and made a huge crash. 
He seemed ok after, hid under the bed for a bit but came back into bed after a bit. 
Then this morning I was walking around my room, and walked behind him as he was eating, and it absolutely panicked him. Now he won't come near me for longer than a second for a quick pat. He even hissed at me when I tried to give him some tuna as a treat. He won't leave my bedroom at all and runs under the bed if I come near him. 

I've left him in my room with all the windows in the house closed for sound, Music for Cats on repeat in the lounge and the bedroom door slightly ajar. 
I have to be at work for 8 hours now and i am just so worried about him. He's been fine left before, and I have been slowly working up to a full 8 hour day apart, but after his scares I'm worried.  

This is quite a big post but I suppose I just want reassurance/advice for how to help him settle. I'm maybe overthinkinh it but my worst nightmare would be that he's suffering, especially after he seemed to be settling in really well",madrrl,2022-11-09,08:10:44,2022,11,9,8,10,Wednesday

I’m just wondering if there is any good way to get him out of this habit. I don’t mind him going on the porch, but I would like to put the gate on the dog door first.

1,CatAdvice,Aggression in our adopted cat...,"We adopted a 4-year old stray back in August and she was incredible quiet and shy the first few weeks of us having her around. We are first time cat owners, so there's a lot we are learning! Our little furiend has been opening up slowly, but that also means she has come to show us maybe her more natural play style which is more aggressive. 

The other day, my SO was eating dinner and she just came up to him and bit his arm (drew blood!) unprovoked. This morning, after playing with her, I was sitting down and she grabbed and scratched + bit my ankle. The past few incidents have occurred in the kitchen; these incidents are growing in frequency.

Doing some internet research tells me she is maybe trying to initiate play? But the biting and drawing blood is clearly a behavioral issue (these are definitely not nips; they're full on chomps). We are not sure what to do. When we give her Gabapentin (we need to for us to be able to trim her nails or go to the vet), she is obviously more chill. I know the original shelter gave her Gabapentin for anxiety for the first few months of her intake because she was so anxious. We are considering giving her meds on the regular, but was curious to know if there's anything we can do to change her behavior without drugs. 

Any help is appreciated! Thank you!",laughing_andcrying,2022-11-09,07:37:33,2022,11,9,7,37,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,advice on new cat acting distant,"So I've just adopted a 2 year old cat one week ago today. I met her at a cat cafe several times and she was super affectionate and I brought her home and she only hid for about an hour and seemed to be right at home right away, always super cuddly and wanted to constantly be with me or my boyfriend. As of yesterday she has become way more distant, sitting away from us etc. She'll still come by for pets and head butting briefly but then she'll go off to be alone. Is this normal as a cat adjusts to a new home? Of course there's a little part of me that's like man what if she just doesn't like me but I'm really trying to do everything right and have always had happy cats in the past. I'm also really worried since we live in a pretty small apartment that she's just not stimulated enough (I've bought her plenty of toys and try to play which she occasionally does but doesn't show too much interest in). I just want to make sure I can provide a happy home for her and i'm worried she's not, even though I'm probably overthinking it all",Lemmecmaturecontent,2022-11-09,04:54:07,2022,11,9,4,54,Wednesday
1,CatAdvice,Advice on cat behavior,"Question about my 3.5 year old male cat

my spouse and I adopted a male cat in the beginning of 2020. He is the sweetest thing and we absolutely adore him. However, he does have a very odd habit and we are constantly wondering if this is normal. As we get ready to go to bed (our place is very small, only 500 ft.² so we are never going far from his usual resting place) no matter the time of day or night he will *run* in the room and begin howling very loudly. He will do this regardless if I’m taking a nap at 2 o’clock in the afternoon or if I’m getting to bed late at one in the morning…But anytime we start to settle down he will absolutely lose his mind. There is no stopping him either, we try to get him to settle, pet him, welcome him onto the bed, let him dig under the covers- he is relentless. It makes me sad because often we have to shut him out of the room because we can’t get him to stop and settle down. 
Luckily he doesn’t really mind being out of the room in the living room as his tree and toys are out there and he’ll sleep usually until about 5 AM which then I will be woken up by his relentless howling again. 

At this time I try to let him in the room and get him on the bed and calm him down. And sporadically he will get up and howl again. He is a very verbal cat, sometimes to a point I can’t even believe. During normal hours of the day he is always talking which is much appreciated as he makes a great companion.. but we seriously cannot figure out why he is doing this when we start to wind down or how to make it stop. We need sleep!! 

A couple other things of note- he gets fed wet food every evening around 6/7 o’clock. We constantly have dry food out for him and he has multiple water locations in the house and two litter boxes. We have another male cat (6 years old) who is a great friend to our 3.5 year old cat- they get along great, cuddle, bathe each other, play.. never had any issues between the two of them after their initial meeting beginning of 2020. 

Any insight would be much appreciated!",hannahelmay,2022-11-09,04:36:55,2022,11,9,4,36,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,Kitten has zoomies after neutering,"I took my 3 month old boy to get neutered today, all went well and the vet said that he's had a long day so would probably spend the rest of the evening sleeping in the dark and not to play with him. 

He was affectionate for about 5 mins when he got back but then went crazy and won't stop. He's even more hyper than he has been before, jumping off the walls, sprinting back and forth etc. It's been 4 hours now and he's not really calmed down.

The vet gave us a cone for his head but did not put it on for us, we tried to put it on but he practically backflips getting it off. It does not stay on for more than a minute. Is this needed? As the vet didn't put it on maybe it's just incase.. We also got no pain medication.

Is this normal behaviour? I know he must have had a really stressful and scary day but the vet told us the opposite would happen. Is there anything we can do? Or just wait for him to hopefully calm down",holoanarchy,2022-11-09,03:36:52,2022,11,9,3,36,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,Is my cat’s level of activity normal?,"My cat is an unspayed (spaying her later this month) female 1.7 year old cat who I adopted two months ago. I don’t wanna hear the “play with her more” advice because I do that enough, I even trained her how to sit. I try to play with her before I leave for class, and in the night I play with her for 30 minutes before I feed her. Sometimes I think she’s stopped being as crazy as when she first warmed up to me, but then there’s still many times in the day where she runs around and has zoomies. Idk how long they’re supposed to last, but sometimes they last more than 30 minutes or continuously as short (5 minute) reoccurring bursts back to back for a good while. The only moments she’s not doing this is when she’s at the window or taking a nap. Every other time, she’s running around everywhere and wants to touch EVERYTHING, even when I’m folding clothes or making the bed. 

She’s able to sleep at same time as me, but she wakes me up 2 hours before my alarm and tries to scratch underneath me  and just bothers me so much. I think she tries to get comfortable on me but she just continuously walks over me, bites my legs, gets under the covers to keep messing with me, and scratches the blankets. I still think that she’s worse in the day, where she does unnecessary stuff like scratch the tv that’s not even on and randomly attacks me. 

Is her age an appropriate age for all this? I have many friends with cats around her age, some even with kittens, and my cat is a complete menace compared to all the other cats I’ve met who don’t care about people or are calmly on people’s lap the entire time. When I get her spayed, is it likely she’ll calm down once she’s healed from the surgery?

1,CatAdvice,No bedroom door is giving our 5 month year old free reign to wake us up at 5am,"Me and my girlfriend took in a kitten named Friday and she's a 5 month old tuxedo cat. She's currently at the teenager years and is running around our small apartment in bursts of energy. We play with her fairly consistently and try to make sure we follow the Cat Mojo method (Hunt, Catch, Kill, Eat, Groom, Sleep) and play with her before we feed her for about 30-45 minutes twice a day, once at 8:30am and once at 8:30pm. Like I said, we live in a pretty small, open-concept apartment and our bedroom is essentially just the attic of a 3 story building. Because of that, we don't have a proper door but rather a set of stairs. And that was all fine until we brought in a kitten. Like I said she's pretty energetic and loves to run around the apartment and get into everything, and this is doubled in the morning around 5am. Lately she's been a complete nuisance, getting into things she knows she's not supposed to, biting wires, scratching up the box spring, pretty much anything she can play with to wake us up. We think it has something to do with daylight savings time, as she'd usually do this around 6 when my girlfriend wakes up for work, but regardless it's pretty irritating and while I understand this is ""just a cat thing"", we'd like to work out some solutions here.

We were considering getting a baby gate and locking her out when she gets like this but as you can see, [the stairway](https://imgur.com/a/qtgAuB3) is pretty wide and there's tons of little nooks and crannies she can get around in. We have 2 other rooms with doors in them in the apartment, the office and bathroom but honestly I don't want to lock her in these rooms when she's misbehaving. That'll only get her to be afraid of me and I don't really want to sacrifice her trust for a few hours of sleep. so that's not really an option I'm willing to take.

Honestly I feel a bit guilty for asking how to keep our cat out of our bedroom as I want the best for her and I know having her sleep next to us will strengthen the bond but at the end of the day, we can't be waking up at 5am every day and be functional.

1,CatAdvice,I think my cat blackmails me by peeing in his bed if I don't get out of bed,"My 4-to-5-month-old kitten has a really bad habit that, from what the vet can tell, is not health-related. It appears that when he wants something (play) and I don't give it to him for too long, he goes to his bed and pees in it.

Usually I always give him the attention he wants and it doesn't come to this, but sometimes he wants to play in the morning when I'm not even out of bed yet so I tend to have the '10 more minutes' mindset. This almost always happened in the morning.

After putting the bed into the washing I do play with him because I'm worried he'll pee again elsewhere... but i feel like this is just encouraging his behaviour because he can see it works :/

My previous cat also had a bad habit of getting me out of bed *(pushing things off the shelf or ripping papers)* but that was less annoying and less damaging so I never really bothered to get her to stop.   
I have no idea how I should go about stopping my new boy from doing it.

1,CatAdvice,Kitten is a bully to new kitten.,"Hoping to get some insight. I have a 3.5 month kitten and have had her for about 1 month. She was a stray before I got her, so no idea if she was alone or what kind of life she had. 

I recently got a 2 month old kitten and at first the older one was growling a lot. She was also shaking and acting more scared than aggressive. We did some slow interactions. 

Over the past couple days, I’ve had them both together and exploring, and the best way I can describe the older kitten’s attitude is fixated and obsessed. 

She will ignore everything and watch the younger kitten. She constantly runs up and smacks her quite hard, but without claws as far as I can tell the growling is getting less, but she will not leave the younger kitten alone. At all. Constantly chasing her, running up to her, smacking her. Even if I lift the kitten up onto the couch and block her with my leg, the older one will run around the couch to find a way to see the younger one. Nonstop. Relentless. Fixated.

The older kitten is a small kitten. The younger one is a Maine coon, so they are pretty close in size, despite the age gap.

1,CatAdvice,How to deal with cats after neuter,"I just got both my cats neutered a few days ago, and they're out of control. The vet said i need to keep them locked in my room for the next two weeks, but in the first night they have destroyed their litter box, my computer monitor, all of my framed pictures, most off my clothes that were in a hamper, and literally everything else that they can get their hands on.

I'm a full time college living with roommates, so there's no empty room I can keep them in. I feel totally defeated. The point of the neuter was to mitigate bad behavior, and it's just seemed to escalate it. I've tried everything to stop them from jumping, but I ended up having to pull a second all-nighter to keep them from play fighting and further destroying my belongings. My grades are suffering because I'm unable to sleep without them attacking me and everything I own. Does anyone know how I could keep them safe during recovery without sacrificing my own health?

1,CatAdvice,Badly needing advice on keeping my dudes secure,"HELP! I need advice on how to secure the window on my high rise apartment. I've been living my day to day with the feeling of safety knowing i have a seemingly fixed screen. I have a small apartment in California and it's currently rainy. Which we get just a hand full of days. I was enjoying the always open window with the breeze and smell and sounds of rain when i looked over and saw my kitten on the OTHER side of the air conditioner's exhaust panel. LIKE AN INCH LEDGE with the screen casually open on the other side of her. I freaked to say the least and eventually grabbed her after making her feel safe. 
What the hell do i do??! I need to have the window open. We can't be trapped but i cannot fathom if one falls out to the concrete below. Just FYI, i have this mischievous Siamese kitten(i know, good god), a giant oaf of an exotic, and a very elderly dude. If he accidently fell......

1,CatAdvice,"My cat bites my head and face while sleeping all the time, and even if I’m just on my bed he attacks me. Please help","My cat is 5 months old, I found him as a stray when he was about 8 weeks old and there have been a lot of ups and downs with him.  Yes he’s been to the vet .

In the past couple of weeks he has been jumping up on my bed and clawing at the covers which scratches the heck out of me, and if I leave my arms out from under the blankets he will straddle them and start biting and rabbit kicking.  Most of the time he is purring while he does so, and it’s not as hard as I know he can bite but it still really hurts and always wakes me up.

Now this behavior has worsened.  Every night, multiple times through the night he wakes me up by biting at my face/head or hair, and he’s even straddled my head and rabbit kicked and clawed the shit out of my head.

I’ll usually get him off of my head and put him on the ground, but he will just hop back on the bed, walk back over to me and resume whatever he is doing.  This isn’t soft bites or kicks, it’s very painful and I end up just covering myself entirely under the sheets, which he will claw at and scratch me through, and then I inevitably just get up and go sleep outside my room.

The worst part is that if I get up, he’s fine.  If I lie on the floor, he’s fine, but if I go to my bed, even if I sit up on the bed he will meow at me, claw at me and bite me until I get up.  He doesn’t want fed because I tried that and he didn’t seem to eager to eat all his food, but I haven’t tried playing with him because usually I’m so pissed off that I’m not about to reward him with playtime.

I always play with him for like 30 minutes before I go to bed and I usually watch him go curl up in his cat tree while I get ready for bed myself.

I can’t let him outside my room unless I am with him because I have two roommates and if they get up before me and leave the house I’m worried he may escape out the front door, or that he will break their items while I’m sleeping and then I’ll have to pay for them.

If anyone has any advice I’d really appreciate it, I don’t know how much more of this I can take.  He’s a fine cat throughout the day but he just acts like a shithead when I’m trying to sleep and I can’t take it anymore.",BagsofBees,2022-11-08,20:39:26,2022,11,8,20,39,Tuesday

1,CatAdvice,"My cat had a stroke, but he still wants to roam the house","He is a 15-year-old maine coon mix. A week ago, he experienced a medical incident that was diagnosed as either a stroke or other embolism. His hind legs were extremely weak. After a week at the vet on an IV and anticoagulants, he has regained some strength. But he still struggles to hold himself upright while standing or sitting.

I brought him home from the vet last night. I arranged a small enclosed area for him to recover in. However, he regularly tries to jump and climb out of the enclosure and can't be left unsupervised. He doesn't know his limitations and I'm sure he will hurt himself if allowed to roam freely around the apartment.

Does anyone have advice for settling him in his recovery area or discouraging the escape attempts. I have provided a covered box with a bed for him to hide in, which he is using. I want him to be comfortable.",Pormwrangler,2022-11-08,18:22:11,2022,11,8,18,22,Tuesday

1,CatAdvice,New cat/kitten owner,"So recently, I’ve gotten a 4 month old kitten with my significant other. I’ve never owned a cat, for the past 20+ years I only had dogs of various breeds. From day 1 this little girl has been attached to my hip. Anywhere I go, she follows along. Granted she does the same thing with my partner , but as they’ve had cats in the past it doesn’t bother them. If the door is closed or she can’t find see us she’ll cry quite loudly. Don’t get me wrong, we shower her with pets and cuddles all day. But as someone who struggles with being overly affectionate or touchy - I find myself getting extremely overwhelmed. If she’s napping with my partner and I get up to use the bathroom or get a drink of water she runs behind me and watches me. At night when we are sleeping, she sleeps in between my legs so moving around is rather hard. During the day she enjoys spending time with my partner but at night she’s all over me. Recently, if I sleep without her she’ll come on my bed and tap my head until I wake up to acknowledge her then she’ll burrow her way into my blankets. I hate the fact that I find myself getting overwhelmed by all of this because it makes me sound/feel awful. The fact that when I want peace or space I have to go into another room without her seeing me.. makes me feel selfish if that makes sense. Trust me I really enjoy the kitty, but apart of me doesn’t understand why I feel this way. Growing up with dogs I’ve never felt like this - so if anyone can give me advice please do.  Also, I don’t want to get rid of her - I just need some sage advice from people who have raised kittens. And if any one has advice on how to get them from jumping on counters that’d be great too.",Selthekid,2022-11-08,15:50:03,2022,11,8,15,50,Tuesday

1,CatAdvice,Moving family cat in with me,"Hello! My family has had my cat Miss Crumbs for 11 years. She’s the sweetest girl but unfortunately she hates the dogs my parents have adopted. 

My parents moved in January of this year and before that they had a two story home. They downgraded to a one story home where Crumbs has her own space to be in, but she’s still close to the dogs/can hear them when they’re barking or being rowdy. 

I moved out in Fall 2021 but because I’ve had such a strong bond with her, my parents suggested I try moving her in with me to see how things go/if her stress reduces. 

So far she’s been here since last Thursday and after doing some research online, I’m keeping her in my room for 2 weeks before slowly introducing her to more rooms of my 4 bedroom apartment that I share with roommates. 

Because she is a senior cat I’m worried about stressing her out by moving her, but I know she’s less stressed here where it’s far more quiet than with my family’s dogs. She’s adjusting fine but definitely spends more time under my bed and I just want to make sure she’s comfortable here, despite the location change and being away from my mom and dad.

1,CatAdvice,Question about adopting feral kittens,"Hi. I’m currently living on Oahu and recently discovered a mother car and her for kittens living under my storage shed in my backyard. The kittens are still being nursed by their mother but they appear to be about 6 to 8 weeks old.

My wife and I were recently talking about adopting a couple of cats and are wondering if it is wise to try to rescue the kittens. The mother and the kittens are definitely feral. I’ve read that kittens can be socialized up to four months or so.

Would it be a good idea to try to adopt and socialize two of the kittens? Does anyone familiar with Hawaii know what we could do with the other kittens? The local Humane Society does not accept feral cats at this time and I’m not sure where else to go.

Or would it be a better idea to leave the kittens with their mother and just adopt cats from the local Humane Society?

The cat had not lived in this apartment full time before, but she was familiar with the space, long story. Everything went well at first. The dog is super chill and wasn’t reacting at all to my cat. Usually she’s lying on the floor somewhere. We gave the cat plenty of space and a protective pet gate she could hide behind until she seemed comfortable. She never really hissed at the dog or showed aggression, she just ran away when she got scared. Through all this, the dog never so much as barked or growled. Suddenly in the past couple days my cat has started approaching the dog and hissing, swatting, and generally being a dick. The dog is very skittish and wants to get away, but sometimes the cat will trap her in a room by standing in the doorway, etc. The dog seems super panicked and I keep breaking it up, but I don’t know what else I can do.

1,CatAdvice,Need Help w/ Cat Urinating Everywhere,"Ugh where do I even begin… My husband and I have a 6 year old female cat. She’s super sweet and precious. However over the last year, she has begun to urinate relentlessly all over the house and it’s driving me insane.

This all began when I first got pregnant. She started peeing on our laundry randomly. I thought she had an UTI so I took her to the vet. The vet told us everything looked fine but gave us an antibiotic just incase. We saw no real improvement in the inappropriate urinating. She then started to pee on the carpets randomly. We thought maybe she didn’t like the box and/or liter she was using, so we changed those out - Didn’t help. I had husband start cleaning her boxes out twice a day - didn’t help. I thought maybe she needed more love and attention - didn’t help. We’ve been just fighting random inappropriate urination by cleaning with enzyme cleaner assuming it was a behavioral issue due to her sensing my new pregnancy hormones, hoping it would eventually pass. The vet said she must be stressed about something causing the behavior since it would come and go. No medical issues have been identified. 

Well since baby has been born 5 months ago, she’s gotten relentless about it. She’s refusing to use her liter box all together. Our son is extremely colicky ( he has a lot of food allergies that we’ve been discovering/removing from his diet) and spends a great deal of time screaming. Hubs &amp; I are pretty certain that kitty isn’t adjusting to baby and is incredibly anxious from his screaming. She’s ruined our upstairs carpet, some hardwood floors, countless pairs of shoes/bags/clothes. I have to clean the bathtubs out daily because she now is pooping in there. There seems to be no rhyme or reason behind locations or textures of where she is going. She hasn’t soiled anything of the baby’s yet but if she does, that will likely push it overboard. We’ve tried anxiety meds, allowing her to go outside, checking for other medical issues. The vet told us as she acclimates it should stop, but it isn’t getting any better - it keeps getting worse. I’m at a 100% loss on how to make this transition easier for her. 

This new Mom is growing exhausted of constantly cleaning up cat pee and poop.  Husband is down to two pairs of shoes after her ruining all of his other ones. Babe is starting to show signs of wanting to crawl - which terrifies me that he’ll accidentally find one of her random spots. 

How do I help her transition &amp; calm down so she can use her liter box again? I feel like I’m running out if options... If we can’t solve this issue, I’m scared we may need to consider rehoming her. However I’m sure it’s damn near impossible to rehome a cat with urination problems… I can’t imagine taking her to a shelter and something terrible happening to her. I’ve never been one to ever consider rehoming a pet, but this is getting out of control and could be a real health hazard for our son. Any advise on how to fix this issue? Any ideas we haven’t explored?",laboratoryblonde,2022-11-08,11:36:34,2022,11,8,11,36,Tuesday
1,CatAdvice,Having To Say Goodbye,"* please no judgement *

Today I made the decision that since i’m moving to another continent that my amazing and sweet cat will not be coming with me as it would be intensely stressful to be fostered for months and then reuniting with me (airplane and train rides, etc). It was about ~$2700 to cargo her to the UK with me, which was not in budget. My other option was to get someone to foster her till August when I can return to bring her with me and have the space ready. I thought about it and spoke to several people and they have all told me that it would be awfully stressful for her mentally. 

It’s the most difficult decision I’ve ever made in my life and I am absolutely devastated and beyond heartbroken because she’s saved my life the 3 years I’ve had her (not an exaggeration), but it’s best for her to not have all of the stress of 8 months without me and then travelling 12-15 hours to a new place, plus being fostered she will get used to her foster parents and then be sad when she leaves them. It’s not fair to her. So I am deciding to rehome her to a family or person that can always be there for her and be constantly there. I have a month and a half left with her before I am deciding to drop her off to her forever home. I will probably never see her again. 

Does it ever get better? I feel selfish for wanting to put her through that long gruelling journey. Will I ever come to forgive myself for this? Will she forgive me?

Any advice would be terrific :( i’m very sad about it all and haven’t stopped sobbing the last few days.",thesunisbrighterr,2022-11-08,11:28:38,2022,11,8,11,28,Tuesday
1,CatAdvice,Stray cat I’ve been taking care of is still exceptionally small. She is the runt of her litter - is this normal or might she have some form of dwarfism?,"Some context: a feral cat showed up and had three kittens somewhere near our house last winter - ginger male, tortie female, &amp; calico female. She bailed eventually, but the kittens have stuck around and we feed them, they’re now about 13-14 months old. The ginger and tortie have been steadily growing, but the calico just stopped one day. She still pretty much looks like a kitten. 

Is it possible she has dwarfism, or could she just be a very small cat? Does she appear abnormally small? She was the runt of her litter and always the most skittish. Not food motivated at all, and I’ve never been able to touch her. She is so skittish that she evaded us BOTH rounds we tried to TNR which stresses me out, but at 13 months she hasn’t been in heat yet either. Not sure if that’s a consequence of her size or something else, but other than these two things she appears healthy. If anyone could weigh in I’d appreciate it - I want to trap her to be spayed , but if there’s any chance she has a disorder I’ll get her to the vet for blood work before going strait to a TNR clinic.

1,CatAdvice,Resident bonded pair introduction to new kitten,So I have a pretty mellow bonded pair of 1.25yo cats that we've had for about a year now. We got them slightly after the socialization window and as a result they really weren't ever properly socialized. Over the year they did eventually warm up to us a bit. We recently added a 2.5mo kitten to the mix. We kept him separated and did our best to follow introduction tutorials and eventually made it to a point where all of them were playing under the door. Hissing and growling was at a minimum if at all so we figured it's a good time to start having some supervised time together. Lots of hissing and growling from the resident cats initially but now all one of them wants to do is play with the kitten. They just chase each other around. The problem is that the other one is still hissing and growling until they're swatting at each other. The kitten for whatever reason keeps trying to play with him and corners him and it gets a bit worrisome so I break it up. As soon as I separate them though the cat that likes the new kitten just sits by his door waiting for him to come out. I'm not sure what to do to get the other cat to feel safe with the kitten. Any advice appreciated. Thanks,mezdup1,2022-11-08,10:54:04,2022,11,8,10,54,Tuesday

1,CatAdvice,cat peeing and pooping in litter box AND on furniture … and not a uti,"i’m seeing the vet tomorrow. but i feel like i’m at my wits end and need to talk about this. 

my cat has peed on my bed and couch several times, and now a nice lounge chair. at first i thought it was because she could smell her old pee in my mattress. but now that she’s peed on the chair for the first time i know it’s not about that. 

many times i’ve caught her digging on either of these places so i picked her up and put her in her litter box and she peed. 

she also pooped once on my bed recently. 

her litter boxes are very clean i make sure of that. they are very accessible and for the most part she uses them throughout the day. 

vet ruled out uti. did a blood test. and if it were uncontrollable accidents (like if she couldn’t help it) she wouldn’t go out of her way to climb up, start digging, and go on our furniture when her litter boxes are right there. 

i feel like i’m losing it a little…. what could this be???",lna432,2022-11-08,10:40:08,2022,11,8,10,40,Tuesday

1,CatAdvice,How to get cats acclimated with the rest of my house?,"I adopted two 13 week old kittens a week ago and have been spending almost every day with them to make their transition easier, and for the most part it’s worked wonders. They’re very calm around me now and they’ve made their new home in my room. The only thing they avoid there are the cat beds I got them, but that’s no surprise. They also won’t let me pick them up yet but I blame that on trying to pick them up too early when they came so I’m sure they’ll come around eventually

Recently however I’ve been leaving my door open for them to explore going downstairs. They made it to the living room exactly once before my roommate came up the stairs and scared one back into my room and the other behind the couch for 10 minutes before we found her. Now, they don’t even bother trying to leave the threshold of my room, since the smallest sound will scare them back onto their cat tree. One of them is also incredibly sensitive to sounds. If he hears the floor creak he freezes up and tries to hide. 

I don’t expect them to get acclimated with a new environment this early, but how can I get them to try and explore the rest of the house comfortably?",apophis457,2022-11-08,10:16:45,2022,11,8,10,16,Tuesday
1,CatAdvice,Liquid Meds Advice,"I just rescued a cat this past Saturday and he is on 2 different liquid meds, one once per day and one twice per day. My first rescue didn’t like getting meds but was relatively compliant. This new cat will not take the meds - I have tried every method. He won’t eat wet food. I went to my vet today to have them show me any tricks and tips and wrapped him exactly as they did in a towel, however, he is literally snapping like a shark and I cannot get near his mouth. I had someone else holding his head/body still while wrapped in the towel but he still came close to biting me. I’m not sure what else to do. The vet says that they don’t offer the meds he’s on in any other form. I offered to bring him as often as needed for shots if possible or any other form they could provide. The meds are just for a cold (antibiotic and anti cold meds is what they told me) so I’m really wondering if there is any other alternative? Really grateful for any advice anyone has. I feel so guilty putting him through this as he’s already so nervous in the new environment and leaving a shelter. He is an angel otherwise and has slept in bed with me belly up the two nights we’ve had together. I just want to make this as easy as I can for him 🥲💔",lexdelaney,2022-11-08,09:38:23,2022,11,8,9,38,Tuesday
1,CatAdvice,Need help! My new 4 month old kitten is eating my blind senior dogs food!?,"I adopted a 4 month old kitten a week ago and I love him! I have a senior, blind pug (Bubba-15yo) at home and they are getting along great. The only issue was that Bubba was a little scared and nervous because he has never been around cats before. But he is slowly warming up, and the kitten is letting him take his time! I just know that they will be taking naps together in no time!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Today though I noticed something a little worrisome. My kitten was eating the dogs food! I have been giving the kitten wet food alongside his dry food and his bowl is never empty. So he isn't starving or anything. I know that my dog would eat the kittens food if he could get to it too (The kittens food is on the patio where the dog can't go). That's not really relevant. I worry about malnutrition if the kitten keeps doing this. My dog is too old, and blind, to try to schedule when he eats (he has been free eating since he was a couple months old). 

&amp;#x200B;

I can try to train him with the spray bottle and positive reinforcement, but I was wondering if anyone had any other suggestions? Please let me know! Also, here are some adorable pics of my babies :)

1,CatAdvice,Caring for really sick kitten,"I’m not really looking for advice but would be nice to hear anyone else’s experience with a super sickly kitten. We rescued our two kittens back in March and we were so in love - they were about four months. Our younger baby, Tig, was very skinny and small but they couldn’t find anything wrong with her at the time. We rescued her knowing she would likely have health problems but we didn’t know the extent of it. All I can say is GET PET INSURANCE!!! It allowed us to treat her to the best extent possible and they paid out £12,000 in six months. We are in the U.K. so might be better here not sure. 

About a month in, she started acting a bit strange and sleeping a lot. We took her to the vet who suspected she had FIP but gave us some other things to try. Fast forward, she almost died in the vet hospital with her stomach full of fluid but we were so lucky to save her with a newer approved drug in the U.K. it involved us giving her a shot daily in her back/neck for two weeks which was extremely traumatic honestly. We finally switched to a pill form and three months later, she seemed to be fully recovered. But as soon as she came off the pills, we noticed she started having diahrrea. 

We did every test, multiple stool samples, two ultrasounds, a colon biopsy to finally settle on her having developed IBS. This took about 4 months and the diahrrea just got worse and worse to the point where she can’t control when she goes. There was also a lot of blood in her stool. She’s now not always able to make it to the litter tray and we are cleaning up poop all over our flat and washing sheets/towels anything we can use to keep it off our furniture. The thing is she’s still eating and has some good days. We were finally able to start her on steroids a week and a half ago but it hasn’t made a difference yet. 

We love her so much and couldn’t imagine giving her away or putting her down. But I’m terrified she won’t get better and we’ve given our lives to her the last six months. I thought we saved her only to now watch her deal with this IBS. It’s so heartbreaking but I’m also trying to be strong. I just want her to get better so badly.

1,CatAdvice,Fear Aggression?,"Hi all! I recently adopted a cat almost a month ago who was considered unadoptable due to his spicy personality. Since bringing him home, he has come out of his shell more and will freely walk around and explore usually after 9pm. He eats, drinks, uses his litter box and has night zoomies. I haven’t attempted to pet him since he seems to be scared of hands coming towards him.

The adoption place didn’t have much background on him before he came to them, but I believe due to his behavior he may have been abused and/or abandoned. At night time, I’ll lay on my couch while he hides under it and I will watch him play with his spring toys. He is incredibly happy and loves to play with them while I “watch” him using my phone’s camera (so I’m not directly watching him). I believe me being in front of him scares him.

During the day, I try to play with him so he doesn’t have any play aggression, however if I sit on the ground or grab his favorite toy, he will hiss at me and growl (while slowly approaching me from under the couch) until I back away. I’m not sure what is causing him to do this. At night he is completely loving and has no fear of me. I’m not sure if it just requires more patience until I build more trust with him or what.

He has a cat tree with hiding spots, I have pheromone spray, lots of toys, and have blocked off under my bed/top of cabinets. Any advice would be great. This is my first cat that has had aggression towards me &amp; I would love to be able to provide a safe space for him to live.",amande1,2022-11-08,04:52:32,2022,11,8,4,52,Tuesday

1,CatAdvice,Will my sporadic schedule affect my cat?,"Hello, I adopted a sweet little single male kitten at 4 months old, he is very independent yet shy. He's been such a good boy and has given me no trouble.   


I work night shift (11pm-7am) during the week, with weekends off. On my weekends, sometimes I like to stay up all day and have a somewhat normal (but often sporadic) sleeping schedule. During the weekend I'll either reverse my sleeping schedule or sleep at random times, giving me time to have a life and do some errands.   


My question is, how much does this affect my cat? He doesn't seem to mind, and he will let me know when he's hungry and when he wants to play. I have no set feeding schedule on the weekends, I leave kibble for him and he snacks on it, but he always waits for wet food for his full meals. I feed him wet food usually 3 times per day, usually half a can at a time, but on the weekends it's at more random times. Basically I just need to know that this OK, but not ideal. I play with him a lot every day, usually 2+ hours day. When he gets older I plan on having a more concrete feeding schedule, as I won't be on night shift forever.

1,CatAdvice,multiple cat introducing,"I have a 9 year old male cat that is very playful and full of energy. I moved to a place with 3 other adult cats and the introductions have not gone well. I put him in my bedroom all day and after dinner time we put the 3 resident cats in another bedroom, set up a baby gate and feed them at the gate. Then after they eat the 3 resident cats stay in that bedroom all night and the new cat explores the house and in the morning they swtich again. They eat at the gate very close to eacother and there is no hissing or growling. Been doing this for 3 weeks after the first failed introduction. However we tried doing a face to face again and within 3 minutes the resident cats started hissing at him and backing away and the new cat started to chase them which caused a massive fight with all 3 cats and him. I've tried jackson galaxies advice and have the feliway multicat plug ins up. Any advice how to get the new cat not to chase and the resident cats not to be so assgrestive? I've had this cat for 9 years now and I'm afraid I will have to give him up over this, he's lived with cats before and doesn't show assgrestion.",Original-Ganache-977,2022-11-07,23:30:48,2022,11,7,23,30,Monday
1,CatAdvice,Two adult cats,"I recently got married and moved with my husband. I have a male cat 1 year old and he has another male cat 4 years old. It’s been one month they are living together, fortunately they didn’t fight, but they are far from being friendly to each other. My cat Weasley, every time sees Magic, follows him everywhere, keeping some distance, and never breaks eye contact (his name now is Weasley, the stalker). Magic tries to ignore Weasley and hiss at him if he gets too close. Both of them are really tense in each other presence.
We try to play with them or to distract them with something positive when they are around each other, but nothing catches their attention. We know it’s too early for them to be friends, but we don’t know what to do to try to keep them in the same room without all the tension.
Anyone had the same experience? Should we keep trying to distract them when they are together? Is Weasley going to get used to Magic and stop stalking him all the time, everyday?",mellaniej,2022-11-07,23:07:12,2022,11,7,23,7,Monday

1,CatAdvice,New cat has a lot of energy and the other cat is newly reserved,"My male cat (6.5 yrs) has lived in a city apartment most his life with another cat. Last year, we lived in a house in the burbs without another cat, but he had a lot of room to run and was very active, watched birds and squirrels out the window, would occasionally go on leashed walks in the backyard, and had more people to give him attention. He was really happy there. He seemed bored when we moved to a new city apartment in June, and became less interested in toys so we thought a new companion would be good for him in the new apartment. 

We got a 1yr old female from the shelter about a month and a half ago. She’s very active and sweet, and obsessed with my 6yr old cat.  We properly introduced them using jackson galaxy’s method, and have had very little issue with aggression. 

The issue is that my male cat is not interested in her at all, and has become disinterested in playing or other enrichment activities without 15 minutes of coaxing, and then we get very little play time before he’s totally withdrawn. The new cat has so much energy, and we’re playing with her close to 2 hours a day and she still tortures our poor 6 year old trying to get him to play. He used to sleep right next to my pillow but has now resorted to the living room for 2 weeks. I’ve tried everything to make him feel extra “special” but he’s totally indifferent and withdrawn. 

What can I do to a) tire out the new kitty better and b) energize my 6yr old cat and help them bond?",oatlystan,2022-11-07,14:15:41,2022,11,7,14,15,Monday

1,CatAdvice,made some errors and now one cat isn't using the litterbox,"My cats have moved with me a few times. I adopted them into a 1 bedroom apartment originally, but their most previous stay was at my mom's house with me. They loved it there. Unfortunately my new job was an hour away so I moved with them. 

Stupidly I had only recently--4 weeks--begun transitioning them to an automatic litterbox. I tried to go too quick. One started peeing next to the litter box or in corners. She still poops in the automatic litterbox. But no pee. I setup a normal litterbox in a corner that she pees in. She won't use it at all but she will pee on a puppy pad next to it.

I started putting puppy pads down in the spots she uses. I have an empty litter box with puppy pads that she will use as long as it's clean, but sometimes she prefers the corner. I need a way to cover the corner.

My cat hates it here. She cries a ton during the day. She often won't leave me alone but won't play either. Just demands I lay on the bed with her or follow her around. Her sister is using the litter boxes but not much happier.

The vet gave me zoloft syrup that the cat won't take. Not in her food. Not in a pill pocket. The vet then prescribed zoloft compounfed treats that she also won't take 

I'm very exaspersted right now. I'm tempted to just move back home or just move the cats home. Maybe go back and forth. Can anyone please help?",theblitz6794,2022-11-07,12:37:45,2022,11,7,12,37,Monday
1,CatAdvice,Having behavioral issues with my two year old cat,"My cat (2) is having issues pooping and peeing outside of the litter box. Almost every day he will poop or pee outside of the litter box and it’s causing distress for my family. These aren’t little messes either, and they take a long time to clean up. This really stresses out my mom and she’s the person that usually has to clean them up. Now for some background information, we got our cat in 2020 when he was a few months old, and then we fostered him. Previous to that he had been living with a vet tech with no other kittens. If you have any knowledge of fostering cats, you know that kittens need to be socialized with other kittens so they learn how to get along with other cats and it helps them emotionally develop properly. Well our cat should’ve been given to us earlier but hadn’t, but anyway we took him in with our other kittens. We already had two other cats at this point. Around New Years 2020 we adopted our cat. Then he started pooping around the house, but less often than he is now. Then we moved houses and this is when the issue started to get worse. He started mostly pooping large amounts around the house. We believe it’s mostly a behavioral issue. It’s also important to add that our cat is very small. Like at two years old he’s about half the size of a fully grown cat when he’s already full grown. He messes with one of the other cats (let’s call him tuxedo cat). Tuxedo cat and the third cat (let’s call him lion cat) our best friends and we think that when lion cats sees tuxedo cat getting bullied he then bullies the cat with issues. Lion cat bullying problem cat could be unrelated to tuxedo cat getting messed with. Anyway the problem has gotten to the point where this is our last straw. It’s too mentally difficult to deal with it every day. We’ve tried almost every solution and they haven’t worked, meanwhile the vet bills have been racking up. We recently took him to the vet again and they think it is a behavioral issue so they’re prescribing him chicken broth prozac and for him to be house trained again for two weeks. We’re doing that in my sisters room and we put a litter box in her bathroom. We think he has separation anxiety from my sister because they are really close and he’s always with her. When she’s not home (which is often because our parents are separated) he will cry outside of her door for hours. The vet also said that the issue may only go away if we if we give him back again to the shelter (no kill) and if he gets adopted again the issue may go away in the new house. We also think that because he wasn’t socialized at the proper age he may only be able to thrive with no issues in a single cat household. My sister will be heart broken if we have to get rid of him but if what we’re trying now doesn’t work we don’t really have another option. Also, all of our cats are male add have been neutered.

1,CatAdvice,Bringing a new cat home,"Hi! This is my first post and I was hoping that anyone with experience or knowledge could help me.
I'll try to be brief. 4 years ago I've adopted my first cat which was already 4 years old. She has been living with me since then and we live in a small apartment (bathroom, kitchen, living room).
Yesterday, previously taking all the medical precautions with both animals, I brought to my apartment my girlfriend's cat. He will be living with us some time due to some personal issues where the cat was previously living.

The newcomer's attitude is to hide in small and dark places. He licks a bit, gets out for food/water, today he was able to use the litter-box. He walks cautiously through the apartment.
On the other hand, my cat, is being territorial. He growls at him, maintains distance and watches him silently. Usually is a very sweet cat, like a really lot, but now she is being grumpy.

I was expecting some sort of similar scenario and I think, based on similar experiences with dogs or relatives cats, that this is a common situation. 
What's I'm looking for is, based on your knowledge and experience, if there is anything that you could recommend me for making this experience ""nicer"" for them. I'm not expecting a quick solution or speed up the process, just any tips or tricks you could teach me!

1,CatAdvice,Have tried multiple times to get a feral barn cat spayed via TNR but wait times are too long. Out of pocket too expensive as well. I’m frustrated.,"There’s a barn cat that lives in the barn behind my property. My neighbor down the road had a cat colony and I guess this cat came from that colony. At first I didn’t mind her presence, she actually keeps the property mouse free. But then she started having kittens. 

Only one stuck around with her and I wasn’t super concerned since they weren’t coming around my house for food. I also thought since they were connected to my neighbors colony that it wasn’t really my business… until they both had kittens under my house last spring. 

I love cats, I have two of my own. But they are indoor cats. But I do not want a colony on my hands both for their safety and just generally not wanting to be held responsible for that many cats. 

I tried via two different humane societies in my area to get the two females signed up for TNR once the kittens were of weaning age but they both had wait lists that were MONTHS out. And both became pregnant again before their turn for the program came which was well into both pregnancies. Thankfully it’s just two males between them. But I tried to get at least the two moms fixed out of pocket to be done with it… but getting a SINGLE cat spayed out of pocket is 500 dollars, what the hell??? 

I feel so trapped. I tried to do the responsible thing the first time around but couldn’t get them fixed in time. Tried a more direct approach only to be smacked with a 1k price tag for cats that I don’t even consider mine ? I can’t bring this to the neighbor either as there is a language barrier. 

I’m gonna try to get them both listed for TNR again and hope they don’t get pregnant before then again, but if anyone has advice I’d appreciate it. 

And just fyi my options are extremely limited for finding other vets because I live in a very rural area.",ShriekingTowels,2022-11-07,11:35:16,2022,11,7,11,35,Monday
1,CatAdvice,How much wet and dry food for new kitten?,"I adopted a kitten who is 3 months old and weighs a little over 2 lbs. I want to give her a combination of wet and dry food, but I'm not sure how much of each to have a proper balance.

So far I've left out half a cup of dry food in her bowl for the day and then she gets a whole 3 oz can of wet food split into two portions for breakfast/dinner.

She'll pick at the dry food throughout the day, but won't eat all of it, so I'm not sure if I should keep giving her half a cup in case she wants more, or if I should lessen what I give.

She'll eat the two meals of wet food no problem, so I'm wondering if she should be eating more than one 3oz can, or is it enough because she also has the dry food?

If it matters, she's still not 100% comfortable in the new house, so she may not be eating as much as she normally would.",Manderlin27,2022-11-07,11:30:52,2022,11,7,11,30,Monday
1,CatAdvice,Good cat fountain that has both fountain and drinkable standing water?,"I have 2 cats, and the old fountain I had for them isn't functioning well anymore so I'm thinking about getting a new one. 

The problem I have though is that one of them loves fountains, but the other one doesn't seem to like drinking directly out of the streaming water (think like, those flower cat fountains where the only water they can drink is directly from the fountain stream). So I have to try to find a fountain that has water that can be reached aside from the running water. 

It seems like this type of fountain is pretty rare. And of course a lot of the ones I've found, on Amazon at least, have lots of bad reviews.

Does anyone have any recommendations? Something ceramic or stainless steel would be best, since one of my cats gets chin acne. Also hoping to find something relatively inexpensive.",thrwaw9y,2022-11-07,11:13:31,2022,11,7,11,13,Monday
1,CatAdvice,Not Sure If I Should Try Different Litter,"Adopted a nine year old cat back in August.  No history or background from the shelter.  

She was obviously a pet and well cared for by someone though.  Loves people (adults and kids), well behaved, etc.  


I have a smaller house, so I bought her a covered litter box.  

Originally I used So Phresh clay litter, but it was way too dusty for a covered box.  It made me squint and cough when I added new litter, and set off my air purifier from 20 feet away.  

So I switched to Dr. Elsey Ultra....dust free and low tracking.  


The thing is, my cat doesn't seem to like it.  She didn't like the So Phresh either.  


I've got a larger covered box than she needs at her size.  And I clean it TWO TO THREE times per day.  

Every time she goes to use it though she puts her tail down and walks into it slowly, then she digs to China for 30+ seconds, kicking a ton out of the covered box/door, then leaves the box with her tail down and refuses to acknowledge me.  She will go and lay down in one of her spots for 10-15 minutes.  

I swear she kicks out a tenth of her litter box content every time she uses the bathroom.  

I have a litter collecting mat outside the box, but it doesn't help.  

I have to use my dust buster to clean her litter mat 2-3 times per day, and I have to vacuum around the litter mat 2-3 times per day as well.

1,CatAdvice,Switching cat litter types?,"Looking to switch my cats litter type and not sure what kind or how introduce new litter. One of my cats had some urinary problems a while a go and she went to to the vet and got all better but since then she won't pee in the litter box, she pees next to it. The vet says it's probably just behavioral since she's fine now. I think she doesn't like the litter anymore because she probably thinks the litter is what caused her problems. So I think if I change it to a different kind of litter maybe it'll help. I get the clay litter now and I want to get to get something lighter weight so it's easier to change since I have a hard time lifting heavy things. What are some good lighter weight cat litter?

1,CatAdvice,Advice for a stray with newborns,"So these past two weeks this stray cat started coming around and I noticed she looked pregnant. I started feeding her and she got friendly with me. I leave my garage door open at night for any critters that might want some shelter from the cold and she ended up taking over a box with an old sleeping bag in it.

Early this morning she gave birth to 4 kittens. They look alright to me, they're nursing and the mama cat is alert and purring away. I'd love to bring this cat and her kittens inside but I have a dog along with three other cats, my house just doesn't have the room for them. I got some fresh blankets for her and I'm building a better/warmer shelter. 

I'm looking for any helpful advice of how to care for them? She's been decently friendly with me and I was thinking of taking her into see a vet but I was worried about trying to get her into a carrier. And now she has babies and I know not to separate them for awhile. I don't know when I should take them all in to get checked out?

1,CatAdvice,first time kitten dad. feeling overwhelmed.,"I'm 21 years old, a college student and I have a job. My friend found a cat in the woods and brought it home over the summer, she ended up having kittens and he asked me to take one. I said I'd think about it. When I told my roommates, they were ecstatic and wanted me to get one so badly. I think I decided to go ahead with it because of them rather than what I truly felt deep inside. 

She's a little over three months old and I've had her for two weeks now. The first week was hell since she's a total ball of energy and I couldn't figure out how to help her get it all out. Now that we have somewhat of a routine, she's sweet and friendly and seems to be happy here. I've done lots and LOTS of research, and I'd like to think that I'm taking really good care of her. She's already bonded with me quite a bit: sleeps next to me almost every night, follows me around the apartment and jumps up on my shoulder all the time. 

I truly care about her so much and I just want her to have the best life possible. However, this responsibility has been weighing on me. I'm out for hours at a time for school and work, sometimes the entire day. I have someone that I'm seeing and I want to go out on dates with them. When I'm home, I have chores, homework and I want to watch TV sometimes. But every second that I'm not paying attention to her makes me feel so guilty. I play with her for at least twenty minutes every day, but sometimes multiple hours. I got her a cat tree and several toys she can play with on her own, and my roommates are usually around to hang out with her as well, but I still feel bad whenever I go out. 

Logically, I know I'm doing everything to the best of my ability. But it's gotten to a point where every time I look at her, I'm filled with regret and the weight of the responsibility I have now, rather than joy and love for her. 

So, I guess I'm just wondering what you guys think. Should I give her back to my friend? Is this just growing pains? Have any of you ever experienced this? Am I cut out for this or is my lifestyle not suitable for a kitten?? Just feeling very confused and overwhelmed and guilty.",dr34dfullyy,2022-11-07,10:28:48,2022,11,7,10,28,Monday
1,CatAdvice,Is it normal for cats to become less interested in toys as they become older?,"I have two kitties, one 7 months old, and the other a year old. They have very different personalities, but the same thing happened once they reached about 6 months old- they decided 99% of cat toys weren't for them, even toys they had passionately loved before. 

Is this normal? They still have boatloads of energy, but they just don't seem interested in playing with toys anymore, including cat wands and lasers, unfortunately. 😭 I know how important stimulation is for a cat, so I keep trying to find things they like, rotating them out regularly, reading articles/watching videos on how to properly play with your cat in case I'm missing something but...nothing.

1,CatAdvice,Feeding Schedule for two 5-6 month old kittens,"Two weeks ago my partner and I adopted two (previously feral) kittens! They are incredibly well behaved and socialized and we are trying to figure out a good feeding schedule for them now. 

We both work jobs where mid-day meals is not an option, so instead we have been doing a decent size bowl of dry kitten food (they self regulate well and a 1/4-1/2 cup lasts about the entire day). We were doing one, half 3oz can a day for each at first in combo with the dry food, but I want to up this to 1/2 can twice a day now. 

They haven’t been complaining or overly begging for food at all, I just want to make sure this seems fine and not too much/too little. 

Like I said, they self-regulate well, they drink a LOT of water, and they always get excited come wet food time so what we give is gone in ~5 minutes. 

Please let me know what you think!

1,CatAdvice,Can separated siblings become friends again?,"A month ago my partner and I got a kitten from a friend. She was two months old when we got her. Her sister was supposed to go to another family, but they fell through. My parents are looking for a cat so I said we'd take the sister for them. They were together from birth to two months old, and now have been apart for a month. 

Last night my partner picked up the sister, thinking he could take her home, and that the two would get along and know who each other were. It did not go that way.... Our kitty was understandably territorial, stalking her sister around and hissing at her. The sister was traumatized, having been taken from her mum and then driven a long way already that day(in the middle of this there was also a fire drill at our apartment, and my partner was outside with both kitties). 

Partner called me, super stressed out, I said to just take the sister to my parents place and we can introduce them later. We were hoping they could be friends and we could socialise them at both homes. We're hoping that when we go away we can take our kitty to my parents place and when my parents go away, we can take the sister. I know cats are territorial animals, but I've heard if you start early enough and regularly enough, they can get used to an arrangement like this. Does anyone have any advice or tips on whether this situation will work? Can we get them to become friends?",plantscatsadhd,2022-11-07,10:05:40,2022,11,7,10,5,Monday

1,CatAdvice,Senior cat constipation issues.,"My senior cat is starting to have constipation issues. The started when the vet prescribed a joint supplement.

I stopping giving her the joint supplement during that time. 

A month later I start giving it to her prior to figuring out it was causing her dehydration. So she is constipated again. She has had a full day of pumpkin and a mild lax. And we finally saw her pass one hard round small turd. So I know the pumpkin is starting to absorb. 

But I am wondering if I could give her a small enema at home to help relieve pressure from the back end. She has started to puke a little for being all stuffed up. But seeing the one turd gives me hope.

1,CatAdvice,My cat is a turning into a pee-monster,"I have a 13 year old kitty, let's call her B (name has been withheld to protect what remains of her dignity). And recently, B has been peeing on everything.

Backstory: my husband and I adopted B from a shelter when she was 4. She had previously been in a traffic accident, and is missing her tail and her back right leg as a result. (I suspect she was the one driving the car). B is an indoor cat and always has been - we are in the UK, so this is actually quite unusual, since the majority of cats here are allowed outside. Anyway. Other than the missing limbs, and a couple of mild bouts of cystitis, B has been in great health since we adopted her. Her mobility is limited in that she can't jump up high, just scrambles onto a chair/bed, but she can run fairly fast. Personality-wise, she's a very vocal cat, pretty social and likes to curl up on my lap, but a bit 'emotionally needy'. We have had issues on and off with excessive crying at night, but that has improved in recent years.

B has occasionally done a 'stress pee' outside her litterbox, if upset by something like an unexpected houseguest. Two years ago, we had a baby, and the stress-peeing got a little bit more frequent. Ok, that's not unusual, cats need time to adapt to a baby. We didn't force any interaction, made sure B had her own baby-free retreat space, kept a Feliway running etc. Now baby is a toddler, and to be fair, they are both good companions. B hasn't displayed any aggression and will happily curl up next to toddler; toddler understands 'gentle hands' and generally respects the cat's space. One big difference is that B is now shut out of baby's room at night (she has free range over the rest of our flat).

In the last few months, B has been peeing outside her box a couple of times a week, and suddenly in the last week she is doing it every day. She has two litterboxes, always accessible, one in each bathroom, and we use the same wooden biodegradable litter that we have always used. The boxes are scooped immediately after a poop, and the litter changed weekly. But she's peeing randomly on rugs, chairs, and anything left on the floor for a moment, such as a towel. She even pees near her food bowl now.

When the issue started a few months ago, I took her to our vet. He gave her a physical checkup, found nothing wrong, and said that the issue was behavioural. Liquid fluoxetine (kitty prozac) was prescribed, which we mixed in with her wet food or a cat-yoghurt treat once a day. This worked well for about a month, but then B figured out that the food/treat had medicine mixed in, and refused to touch it. So then we were back at the original problem. I can't get her to take the food via syringe or spoon, because it causes her a huge amount of distress which defeats the whole point of prozac.

I suspect/fear that she is bored, because she will often paw at furniture or the window blinds to make a noise and get our attention. She gets lots of social attention, i.e. petting and lap time, but it's really hard to play with her because she ignores most toys, ribbons, string, balls and so on. I've bought enrichment toys for her, I try hiding ribbons under things for her to find, and she either bats at them for two minutes then loses interest, or just acts like they're not there. I suspect the missing limbs/mobility issues make it harder for her to play.

I have a call scheduled with the vet tomorrow, and obviously will be getting her checked again. She is eating and drinking normally. If anyone has any ideas, suggestions or magical incantations to the cat-gods, please do share!",OwlOfDerision,2022-11-07,05:59:44,2022,11,7,5,59,Monday

1,CatAdvice,Scaredy Cat,"I fostered a stray litter of 3 this summer. I planned on keeping 2 but fell in love with all of them so I decided to keep them all. I dont have any other animals. Right now they are almost 5 months old. The biggest of the 3 is a pretty orange tabby named Ginger. Lately, about the last 3-4 weeks, he is starting to get skittish with noises. Most of these noises he has heard his whole life, like a vacuum and a blender. Sometimes when he gets into a skittish mood he will even run from me when I approach him. I hold, rub, play with all of them since the day they were born many times a day, so it almost makes me want to cry when he runs from me. When I do sometimes get him in my arms he is quick to purr and be affectionate and closing his eyes. When he comes out of his skittish mood he seems content and happy. He never hids to go to sleep or hids from his brothers. Is this a phase he is going through? Is there anything I can do to help him?",menno_girl,2022-11-07,05:14:58,2022,11,7,5,14,Monday

1,CatAdvice,Encourage teething kitten to eat?,"Hello! I have a 4.5 month old kitten who’s just began teething. For the past two days he has been reluctant to finish his meals. This boy can EAT, so it is weird for him to leave at least 20% of his meal in his bowl. He’s getting like 50-100 fewer calories a day. 
He gets both wet and dry food each meal. Three days ago he struggled to chew his dry food so I soaked it and turned it into mash but he won’t eat that. He will eat most of the wet food but still leaves a good amount in his bowl. I can’t give him more wet food because that would require him to eat so much more food to get his caloric requirements and he refuses to finish that. I’ve tried. 
I’ve also tried heating food up, cooling food down, teething toys, kitty food popsicles, different bowls, lick mats, flavors etc. 
I’m not sure if this is typical for a teething kitten. Any advise? Also, I have a vet appointment set up for him this week to discuss this but in the meantime, what can I do for him?",Particular-Ad-2645,2022-11-07,04:42:28,2022,11,7,4,42,Monday

1,CatAdvice,Elderly Cat and New Puppy,"Hi there! I'm hoping to get some advice on introducing a puppy to an elderly cat.

Our cat is 15/16, and still quite active with no notable signs of aging. We're thinking of getting a puppy, but we're currently unsure whether to wait for our cat to pass or not.

Even though she's old, we've seen her a few times with the neighborhood cats. She doesn't show any aggression towards them whatsoever, and most the time just sits and watches them. Even when a stray use to come in at an old house and eat her food - she'd just sit there and watch. Completely chill. And we had loud dogs living next to us previously, and she never flinched when they barked at her, came to the fence etc. However she does not like children whatsoever, and will go into a bedroom if any ever come round (which is rarely).

We don't know if she has ever lived with a dog before, as she was a rescue cat about 10 years ago.

What do people think? Should we wait or does it sound like she'd be fine with a puppy?",InvestigativeCookie,2022-11-07,03:54:51,2022,11,7,3,54,Monday

I have a 4 y/o female cat (spayed)  that has been vomiting nearly every day for most of her life. I have tried many types of food (prescription diets, grain-free, wet food, expensive brands, vitamins) but nothing seems to work. 

Nowadays, I literally only feed her 6-7 *pieces* of dry food at a time, but more frequently. She loves food and otherwise acts normal. I also noticed that she mostly throws up in the mornings. 

I took her to the vet a few months ago, but the veterinarian was not able to do a physical exam or any lab tests because she was acting very aggressively towards everyone including myself (i.e, hissing, growling, biting). This is not new behavior for her, as she generally hates car rides, her carrier, and new people. Because of this, I am not able to get a proper diagnosis for this issue. 

I just wanted to know if you all have any suggestions regarding this issue. Any advice would be helpful!

1,CatAdvice,Adult cat (Male 1 yr) has hard to predict behavior with kitten (female 10 weeks),"I slowly introduced my adult cat (Risotto) to my kitten (Matcha) and at first they didn't like each other, but with a little time stopped hissing at each other. 

But now they will tackle each other and play, and because Risotto is much bigger than matcha he always winds up on top. She gets vocal about it with meows, and occasionally growls and hisses (every time this happens we have to get up and then risotto runs away) 

Occasionally he also comes over and starts licking her and all that. Sometimes she even purrs when it happens, but then after a minute (mostly of him licking the same spot like an idiot) she starts batting at him playfully, and then he gets mad and angry swats at her (which we quickly separate them) 

I don't know how to help the situation?

It's not like matcha is afraid of him. She frequently runs at him and plays with him (and his tail) 
And it's not like he doesn't want to play (he ALSO initiates play)


Is he being malicious with her? Some if his behavior is nice, but why doesn't he let up when she's meowing and growling or hissing??

Part of me thinks he's trying to establish dominance but I don't think she's willing to be the submissive one. 

(Also just so everyone's aware, they are only allowed to be around each other with supervision) 

Any help explaining the behavior, or advice is greatly appreciated! Let me know if there are any questions I can answer to help explain anything further",misssunshinefairy,2022-11-07,01:54:14,2022,11,7,1,54,Monday

1,CatAdvice,introducing new cat to gluttonous cat,"Hello, I have had my cat Greg for over a year, and he's amazing. However, while I appreciate that he'll eat pretty much anything, other cats aren't as fond of that trait. 

I tried having a new cat here for the weekend, let's call her Girl. She seemed to love me, but hissed and growled to Greg. He was okay with it and backed off, sometimes purring gently to her. In the end they even tried playing with each other and the hissing became less frequent. 

I didn't mind she didn't eat the first evening/night, neither pellets nor fresh food. I got a bit worried today when she'd been refusing to eat for over a day. It didn't matter whether Greg was in the room or not, she refused every chance to eat, so I had her sent back home. What she didn't what, Greg would happily devour when I turned around. The bastard has ate enough for an entire week, stumbling away from his last meal. 

My next plan is to let Greger spend next weekend at another place (where he feels at home), have the new cat spend the weekend alone with me and see if she'll be comfortable eating. 

Is this a decent idea? I tried separating them, closing doors (both complained loudly about the door being closed), tried different types of food, to no avail.

1,CatAdvice,What can I do to comfort my kitten in New Year’s Eve?,"So I have a six month old Norwegian forest cat, and she has brightened my life ever since I got her. She is unusually brave when it comes to everything but noise, as a particularly hard closing of drawers or closets will spook her into hiding for a while, and I once dropped my plate and she went into full on panic mode.

So I’m really worried about how she will handle the fireworks on New Year’s Eve!

I live in Bergen, Norway. And we always have quite the firework show that lasts for hours downtown where I live!

1,CatAdvice,outdoor vs. indoor,"hi first off, I’d like to give some context. I’m a minor, and I live with my parents, so I really don’t have a whole lot of control in some ways over our cats. 

Anyways, we have two cats. Both initially were outdoor cats who would come inside always at night and whenever they wanted to. They probably were inside more than outside, but were free to roam out in our yard especially since we had no neighbors at the time. Then, we ended up moving into an apartment. Our cats (M4) and (F9) have been indoor cats since then, as we have no easy access to the outdoors for them. I don’t think they’ve minded being indoor cats, though my boy cat has tried to sneak out into the hallways thinking it’s the outdoors and ends up meowing at the door; also, he has gained a bit of weight since he has been an indoor cat. 

Unfortunately, we have to move again, and my parents really want our cats to be outdoor cats again. I really am worried about it as they could get eaten by coyotes, hit by a car, or contract parasites etc. But they won’t take no for an answer- and refused my catio ideas or only supervised outdoor time idea. I’m at school all day and my parents work all day, so if my parents leave them outside in the morning, chances are they will be unsupervised until I come home in the late afternoon. The only thing my parents have conceded is to never let them be outside at night.

I would like my boy cat which is the overweight one to have more exercise, so maybe it wouldn’t be all bad to have him get some outdoor time. However, I’m also worried about bird populations- as he used to hunt when he was a kitten. Not to mention- a big concern of mine is that they haven’t been outside in years and what if they don’t know how to take care of themselves out there anymore? Our girl cat is feral and very small; she is in incredible health, but when she was an outdoor cat she would always hide underneath our porch, and to be honest, I think she could get eaten so easily.

what do you think I should do? it’s pretty much impossible to persuade my parents, but is there any way i can protect their safety while I’m at school and make the transition easier for them? My parents said they don’t have to go outside if they don’t want to, but I know my parents will take my cat meowing at the door as him wanting to be outside.

I greatly appreciate any advice and will read every comment!",muffinmuppetman,2022-11-07,00:56:55,2022,11,7,0,56,Monday

1,CatAdvice,Can clumping litter cause sneezing?,"Hi there! Recently adopted a cat from a local shelter last Tuesday, for the most part its been going smoothly but the last day or so he's been sneezing a lot. I'm wondering if this could be caused by the clumping litter he uses?

Because when we got him, the shelter gave us a little adoption kit which included one a disposable, ready to use litter box. Which was basically just a tinfoil pan with some basic litter in it, we used that for the first couple days and on Thursday we swapped to a a regular box and some fragrance-free clumping litter, specially Tidy Cats Free and Clean Clumping. Then on Friday and Saturday we noticed he started sneezing a bit. The shelter told us that he was mostly healthy (save an unrelated factor) and I don't think they'd lie, so the sneezing seems to be new. Any chance this could be related to the litter and if so are there any recommendations for other litter he won't sneeze?

1,CatAdvice,dry food allergy?,"Hi all,

I adopted my cat a couple of months ago and used to give him baby food because the vet advised so for a couple of months and then slowly introduced wet food.

I used to give him dry food too earlier and it seemed to be okay for him. From about 2 weeks he has been having digestion issues and whenever I give him dry food, he gets loose stools. 

Two times now i completely removed dry food until he was okay but if i give him a fistful of dry food once a day, he gets loose stools again.

I've been using the same brand (whiskas) for his dry food. Is there any possible reason why he may have such reaction to it?

1,CatAdvice,Cat Grooming- Need recommendation for tools and resources,"So I’ve had my cat Nala for 8 months now and she’s just… so great honestly. But she’s also SO floofy. Thankfully, she loves being brushed and pampered and even does ok with nail trimmings. 

I’d really like to get into grooming a bit more. Her mane, fluffy pants, and toe tufts are a bit too long which causes her to track litter out of the box

Back in the day I was a vet assistant so I have a solid understanding of how to hold her for these things in a way that’s safe for everyone. I’d like to do this stuff at home to save myself some money and save Nala the stress of leaving the house. That said, I wouldn’t mind a bit of start-up cost on some quality grooming tools.

Looking for recs on brushes, trimming scissors/ clippers, and anything else to help keep her beautiful floof healthy and sanitary. Also any books, websites, or YouTube channels that you’ve found helpful. Thanks!

1,CatAdvice,"Is there any chance a 2,5-3 month old kitten will find its way home after been missing for almost 24 hours?","We decided to adopt a cat with my roommate and we drove like a 1,5 hour drive to the owners. Everything went well, we got supplies from them etc. and just as we were to drive off from the possession the kitten got out of my friends hands before being put in the box and slipped through the slightly opened car's door. He ran behind the house and we immediately went looking for him. We spent more than an hour looking for him with the owners on their property and the close neighbourhood (there's some grassy terrain there and other homes, not much trees though), but he just couldn't be found, and we had to get back to our place as it was getting dark anyway. 

We joked that he probably is hiding somewhere and looking at us the whole time, and the owners said they don't worry too much and that they can get him to us when he gets found, but it's been close to 22 hours now with nothing and I'm very worried. It's getting cold outside and it's been raining.

As far as I've heard, he wasn't always completely indoor, even though they do keep him inside now, they said he had a tendency to hide in their car's engine (we checked that thoroughly).

I'm honestly really scared for the cat and my friend's well being (she has been through A LOT, and now I'm pretty sure she's blaming herself and thinking she must be cursed or something). But I do know it is our fault and I too feel really terrible about it. 

I did some research yesterday and wrote to the owners suggesting to put the kitten's litter box outside so it would help him get home by the smell, but there's still no sign of it. And it's not like a bigger city where I could find a fb group to post a notice.

Do any of you think that after this time there's still a chance for him to be found ? Or at least a chance that nothing bad happened to him and someone just took him or something? I honestly don't have too much hope but just wanted to ask",jkd10,2022-11-06,20:13:50,2022,11,6,20,13,Sunday
1,CatAdvice,Is my resident cats stalking normal?,"Hi everyone! 

I am looking for a little advice on having a multi cat home. 

Backstory - I have a 4 year old ginger boy named Kevin. For his entire like it’s mostly just been us, so he’s a little on the spoiled side. A few months ago we moved in with my long time boyfriend and then one week age, we brought home a 14 week old Sphynx kitten name Ira. 

We did the usual quarantine period for Ira, we scent swapped, we added Feliway diffusers to our house, we fed them on opposite sides of the door and after about 3 days my resident cat seemed ready to meet the newcomer. 

The first day was lots of hissing and growling from Kevin, the second day significantly less, and the third day Kevin never made a peep. 

So overall, they seem to be doing well! My question is: Kevin seems to follow Ira literally everywhere, is that normal? Also what other behavior is pretty typical when introducing cats for the first few weeks/months and when can they be left alone together? 

Kevin was my first cat and Ira is my second so I’m really new to all of this. Thank you for any help!!",deedles516,2022-11-06,19:29:45,2022,11,6,19,29,Sunday

They are ~8 months now and we had them when they were around 2-3months. The male cat absolutely imprinted on me. He follows me everywhere and even sleeps on me at night.

1,CatAdvice,my kitten is making my life a living hell,"Hello all,

I really need help with a situation in my house. My boyfriend and I (24F/28M) took in a kitten a few weeks ago when he was just 4-5 weeks old because a friend asked us to. I warned him that it wasn’t a good idea as we had a senior cat at the time, but we kept him anyways. He spent weeks 2-4 being handled and bottle fed by the friends we got him from. We believe they may have played with them with their hands when he had just started to open his eyes and walk due to his behaviors now. Our senior was adopted just a few months before him and really didn’t like him. She actually got very attached to my boyfriends parents and now lives with them and has a very happy life. Fast forward to now, we have tried EVERYTHING. And I mean everything- to get him to stop biting. I’m not talking about kitten nibbles or love bites- he bites HARD. We’ve tried doing more play time and deterring with toys but he has no interest in any type of toy once he sees us walking away. Yelping, saying “ouch”, pulling away all make him bite even harder. He’s incredibly play aggressive like nothing I or any of my friends have seen before. I have scars all up my arm just from the time we got him at 4 weeks old to now at 10 weeks old. In a last ditch effort to try to chill him out, we got another kitten today as recommended by our vet. I may be jumping the gun since it is only day 1, but he will not leave her alone. Luckily she is a very patient and confident cat who really shows a lot of interest in him, but even still she doesn’t like him constantly swatting at her. He isn’t hurting her or using claws, he just keeps slapping her over and over. I know I should be patient and give it time, but I am really considering revoking him. The only thing holding me back is the fear that he will be put down by a shelter due to how aggressive he is. Please please help…",Bimbo_in_pink,2022-11-06,13:07:27,2022,11,6,13,7,Sunday

1,CatAdvice,Engineering project for cat intros?,"I lack the expertise to do it but I know there has to be a way - hear me out. 

Struggling to get two cats introduced. We need a “magic door” that will help them form positive associations. 

Both cats are RFID chipped. What I’m envisioning is some sort of system that will dispense treats (and preferably play a chime or something) any time both cats are near their side of the door. But not when just one is by the door - it has to be both of them. And the treats have to drop on both sides. 

This is both a cat problem and an engineering / programming problem that my English major hasn’t prepared me for.

1,CatAdvice,Adopting Friendly Outdoor Cat,"Hi, I moved into a new condo complex. There is a stray cat that hangs out in the area, lounging on cars and such. We have become friends. The cat was once an indoor cat but left outside when its owner moved according to a neighbor. The cat gets fed by a different lady but does not seem to be let inside. I live in an area with mild/moderate winters in the US. The cat likes to come inside my unit and wonder around, very much a people cat and loves human attention. No issues when the door is closed. Is it better that this cat stays an outside cat or is it possible the cat could have a happy life as an indoor cat? In a perfect world, I would bring the cat inside and adopt it as I currently have no pets. I feel morally conflicted as someone already feeds the cat and the other neighbor says hi to it with her dog, like I would be stealing the cat from the neighborhood. The cat has no problem coming inside but also does not appear to be suffering outside. It would not be possible to have a cat door put in.

My cat is acting weird since last Sunday. She is a 2-year-old female Siamese and she has been fixed. 
She is always a happy cat and we give her lots of attention.
She used to have good appetite and always finished her food on time( we feed her quality food, and change her water bowl twice a day ). 
Since last Sunday, she suddenly changed her behavior and stopped eating. We bought her to the vet, did x ray, and barium test, and found nothing. 
We have no idea what happened to her see if you have any ideas. She currently eats less than before and sometimes has saliva hanging outside of her mouth.",bigsnow999,2022-11-06,06:04:33,2022,11,6,6,4,Sunday

1,CatAdvice,I'm so anxious and stressed over whether or not I should bring the kitten I adopted back to the shelter...," I adopted a 3-4 month old kitten a week ago (coincidentally on national cat day!), and he is just the sweetest thing. I have no issues with his attitude, his energy level, nothing. I knew what I was getting into when it came to the kitten and his needs. And he is actually a lot sweeter and easier to take care of than I anticipated! But the reason I am considering taking him back is because of my severe anxiety disorder and my senior dog. Although I have no problem playing with the kitten, and all the other things that he needs, I can't seem to control my anxiety ever since I got him. It feels like I am always on the edge of an anxiety attack. I do think a week is a very short period in time. But my dog is also not the hugest fan of the kitten (which I was worried about). He isn't aggressive or anything, it just seems like he is avoiding the kitten and has gotten a lot clingier and depressed. The kitten doesn't mind my dog though, if anything he actually has been trying to cuddle with him.

&amp;#x200B;

Although I agree that it is possible that more time might help, I also know my dog and my anxiety very well. And I don't think that this will just go away in another couple of weeks or even months. I feel like such a terrible person for wanting to take the kitten back when he is so sweet. He has done absolutely nothing wrong. At the end of the day it seems like he is just not the right fit for us. I think that if I do take him back, I won't be adopting again until my dog passes. I think it is just the best situation for the both of us for now.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm mostly posting this because I want to know if anyone else has had to make a tough choice like this? I am worried that I will regret taking him back. But I am also worried about keeping him longer, him getting attached and regretting not taking him back. Would I be a terrible person if I had to take him back?",Klutzy-Key-1868,2022-11-06,05:26:08,2022,11,6,5,26,Sunday

1,CatAdvice,How to keep cat cool in a really hot apartment?,"I live in a crappy old apartment building, and I don't have control over whether I have heat or AC, they switch it over for the whole building when the seasons change. We've had it switched to heat since the beginning of October,  but today and the next two days are supposed to be unseasonably hot for where I live, like 75° and above. To make matters worse, I live on the top floor, and heat rises. I'm doing everything I can to keep it cool in here--blinds shut, lights off, fan blowing, HVAC units off (obviously)--but it's still stupid hot in here. For reference, my thermostat says it's currently 78° inside. 🥲

As much as it sucks, I can handle it, but I'm worried about my cat overheating. He's not showing any danger signs of heat exhaustion, but I don't want it to get to that point.

1,CatAdvice,Trying to figure out why my cat only bites me,"I have a 1 ish year old cat that I've had since a kitten. We took him off the street as a rescue, and he grew up as an only cat so he is naturally quite needy and demanding of attention. I also think he didn't learn the bite inhibition too well since he never grew up with playmates. He loves to play bite and I never intentionally encouraged this behavior but I dont know how to get it to stop. 

I moved in with a new partner about 2 months ago, and my cat loves my partner and rarely seems to bite him unless clearly provoked. Yet my cat still bites me in 2 situations almost on the daily: ambushing my feet which he finds absolutely delightful but I don't know how to get him to stop. I have scars on my legs. 

He gives both of us affection for petting (he seeks my attention more frequently) but he ONLY bites me! And when we have guests he doesn't do it to them when they pet him (unless they irritate him by touching his stomach, etc). And when I pet him, he only bites me! I cant see any way that i pet him any differently than my partner or any guests that come over to our home. Granted, he doesn't bite hard, it always seems to be a playful bite but he does still on occasion break skin and I don't know how to discourage this behavior nor do I know why he only does it to me. 

When I see him hiding and eyeing out my feet, I sometimes try to get a toy and throw it near him so he gets distracted but then he plays with it for 10 seconds and then looks for the next opportunity to ambush my feet. And when he bites me when I pet him I stop petting him and giving him attention. I don't know what to do next.

Now he is good and wants lots of attention. He always comes to me to be petted and purrs. The only thing is that when he is close to my legs he bites me (not a strong bite) and he never licks me. 
So I was thinking is it possible he thinks that biting is a sign of affection and he doesn’t know that he can lick me instead??
He is still scared sometimes. Also it happens sometimes he hisses at me when I walk from a room to another. 
I tried to tell him everytime with loud voice not to do it even when he bites me and clap my hands but nothing, he doesn’t stop!!
Do you have any suggestions?

1,CatAdvice,Cat Introductions: 4 mnth and 9yr old. Positive Outcome stories? (I'm not confident),"So, already one week in (New kitty came home the 1st, 4 months old, NAME: October) New kitty is coming out of his shell at Basecamp (Cat Play Room). 

October's Backstory: October was OG a stray, he shows signs of being VERY cautious and nervous and for the first 3 days only hid within the room. NOTE: I am following Jackson Galaxy's Guide to Cat Introductions.

For past few days he comes when I walk into the room, loves to be pet, and loves to play. He eats treats out of my hand too. HOWEVER, he hasn't shown signs of wanting to get out at all to explore more of the house. Sometimes he even runs under the bed when I open the door, it's 50/50 if he comes or runs. I have not heard him scratch/meow at the door or try to dart out.

My 9yr old *Minda* tends to hiss and growl under the crack in the door, but instantly runs if she even spots him (he will peek outside the door when I go to leave sometimes) then walks back to door and hisses underneath it. She even seems cautious when she walks by the door.

Minda's Backstory: She grew up with my now gone 14yr old kitty since she was 6 weeks old, so she HAS had experience with other cats. HOWEVER back when Dad was married to a girl who had two Cats Minda would growl, hiss, and chase her cats to the point where they would hide and hardly come out. I'm afraid she will treat October the same bc he isn't a cat she grew up with.

I am still on the first 2 stages (Keep in basecamp and scent swapping) as he has shown no signs of wanting to sight swap yet. I'm worried at this point that he won't show any signs of wanting to explore more (ik it's only been one week, but when I first moved into new trailer it took Minda 1 week to realise it was her new home and to not hide). NOTE: I did put him in my arms and walked around the house in hopes it would trigger some curiosity.   However he buried his face into my arms most of the tour, it was probably too overwhelming - Minda was trapped in Bathroom during tour to make sure she didn't see him or hiss at him.

Does anyone have any cat introduction stories that are similar to mine that ended on a positive note? Any advice to help his curiosity to want to explore so I can begin the next step? I don't want to force it on him and overwhelm him.",J4ywolf,2022-11-05,23:44:46,2022,11,5,23,44,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,I got my almost 2 year old Male cat nuetered but I’m worried he will still spray,"A little background of why it took a while for my cat to get neutered, there are almost no near vets where I live. And finally a vet clinic that’s near us newly opened and I immediately requested for an appointment. For a year we’ve been dealing with his excessive meowing and spraying, thankfully he wasn’t aggressive just very restless, specially at night. His neuter procedure went well and he is currently recovering and eating well. But now I am worried that this will not fix his spraying problems as the vet told me that it will probably only lessen it since he got neutered late. Our cat is quite skittish and he is pretty good at tolerating things, like taking a bath, or wearing a harness for a little walk. I am holding some hope that maybe it will fix some of the problems. If there’s anyone here that also has a similar situation, I’d like to know how it went for you.

1,CatAdvice,Loss of kitten,"Hi guys, i’m just trying to get my feelings out and cope. Maybe look for some advice too. 

In July i got a kitten, Eddie. He was 3 months old, a tiny little black/brown, white furball. I have another cat, Monty, who turned one end of October. First day we got eddie, we sat with him in our spare room, letting him explore and meet us. He took to us almost immediately, I remember he sat on my laps and just started purring and squinting his eyes at me. We forgot to close the door properly and Monty managed to squeeze through because hes an impatient little a-hole and to my surprise he was very accepting of eddie. 
Eddie was a great kitten. He would come and sleep with us, never bit or scratched intentionally. He would do that meerkat thing cats do when they want to see something clearer. He came to the rescue whenever i was upset, curling up next to me and purring away. He was quiet on our way to the vets, even though the bus rides were bumpy.  He did some funny things, like try to cover his poo by scratching everything but the litter. Honestly, i’d say we struck gold with him. 
About three weeks ago he started to get ill. He had runny poops, sometimes he’d vomit, became more lethargic, stopped going out and started following me everywhere. We took him to the vets several times. He was on anti-inflammatory syrups, then different foods, then antibiotics. Last week the vet ran some tests and diagnosed him with coronavirus, said with the symptoms he has it sounds like FIP. We went back on Thursday and after scanning his stomach, she found fluid and advised us to put him down. We agreed and we stayed with him until the end. 

I was crying so much. I’m an emotional person, and all it takes is a sad advert to make me cry. So you can imagine how bad i was sobbing. Eddie and Monty are our first pets we had. (I’ve had dogs and cats when i lived with my parents but these two were the pets i bought with my own money, and bought their food etc) so this is the first time i had to put down an animal. When she administered the anaesthetic he was gone in 2 seconds. His head just dropped and his eyes just dilated. Every time i think about it i can just imagine his eyes, so lifeless. We decided to get him cremated so looking forward to him coming back home. 

I don’t think i was ever this sad. Everything just reminds me of him. I’ll cry for a bit then stop and cry again in like 2 hours. I haven’t ate much, don’t feel like eating. I haven’t slept in my bed, i haven’t really left the house since Thursday, haven’t spoke with my family. I miss him so much. I’m scared that whatever cat i’ll get next i’ll expect to be like Eddie, and i’ll hate them if it’s not. My partner would like another cat in the future because i agree, the house feels empty when it’s just us and Monty. But i’m not sure if i can get another cat, maybe not yet at least. I dunno what to do with myself, i dunno what to do moving forward. It feels like i’m waiting for him to come back. I just think about how we were gonna have Christmas together, he was gonna see snow and a Christmas tree for the first time. But now he’s somewhere on his own, probably cremated by now :( and he’ll never get to experience these things. He was just a little baby. And i miss him so much. I know this whole thing might be weird to some of you, but he really meant the world to me.

1,CatAdvice,My cat and my best friend's dog.,"Hello! I have a male cat (neutered of course) who I adopted about 5 months ago. He is very settled and not (as far as I know from neighbours) aggressive with other cats - he even has cat buddies. My friend has recently adopted a small chihuahua male puppy. She lives locally and ideally I'd love to get them used to each other so I could occassionally dog sit if she has to go out.

Is this realistic? If so, what's the best way to get them used to each other?",doddle30,2022-11-05,22:11:18,2022,11,5,22,11,Saturday
1,CatAdvice,My cat demands eye contact when I pet her,"I know I know “eye contact is a sign of aggression to cats” hear me out lol. 

Lately when my cat is on my lap (she’s extremely affectionate/clingy to me and is with me most of my sleeping and waking hours) and I’m petting her, she stays in this very demanding state. She starts to climb up my chest to get closer to my face, meowing at me. Her body language is the “you’re not paying attention to me” agitation she gets sometimes. 

But when I look at her, and maintain eye contact with her while petting her, she starts to settle down and look content. After maybe a minute or two as she starts to get sleepy I can usually look away and get back to what I’m doing. 

It’s like she’s saying “hey don’t half ass your attention to me, stop paying attention to that magic box and pay attention to me! Sometimes she seems to want me to talk to her too. 

Does anyone else’s cat seem to want eye contact? Or if not that specific thing, does your cat have any behaviors that are outside what people expect cats to like/dislike?",_UnreliableNarrator_,2022-11-05,21:27:23,2022,11,5,21,27,Saturday
1,CatAdvice,Kitten neglected? Dog hogging attention,"We bought a kitten and a dog around the same time. The cat maybe one week before. They are nearing about 1 year old each. The dog is constantly seeking attention, play, and likes to wrestle the cat. 

As they have grown the cat has become more and more quiet. Less active. We had a realisation - with such an in your face dog the cat doesn’t get much attention - playtime.

We use to have her chase string and play with toys. But if the dog was anywhere around he would barge in making it impossible. She is become more and more aloof as she gets older. Still hangs around the house. And talks to us. But less and less.

Have we neglected our cat too much? Or is this just how cats can get as they approach 1 year.",finalattack123,2022-11-05,21:25:45,2022,11,5,21,25,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,Cat Will Not Stop Surprise Attacking,"Hey all. My cat has a bad habit of sneaking up behind people and attacking. She’s a 3 year old domestic shorthair and she’s been doing this ever since she was an adult. She will come up behind you and wrap around your leg and then dig her claws in and bite as hard as possible. Sometimes she just randomly does it too, not even trying to be sneaky about it. She also will bite your foot if you are laying down. She has been constantly fussed at for this, my mom uses a spray bottle on her (which I’ve heard doesn’t do much) but I honestly can’t think of what else to do. It’s absolutely infuriating but I don’t think she’s doing it to be mean, she’s just young and frisky. But she draws blood almost every time.

1,CatAdvice,My cat keeps peeing outside of her litter box.,"Looking for insight if you've had something similar happen: 

I have a 2 and 1/2 year old Tabby female whole lives indoor only. She randomly started peeing outside of her litter box about a year ago and we have no idea why. We have another cat with her and he is about the same age and they get along really well. We clean their three litter boxes twice a day, have a pet water fountain, and they always have food in their bowl. Nothing new to their environment and same routine every day. 

She pees anywhere. She doesn't have a favorite spot. Two mattresses, one sofa, 4 rugs, and a comforter have all fallen victims to her piss. We recently spayed her (3 months ago) with the hope that she'd stop. Relief lasted up until yesterday when we found another of our rugs peed on. We have talked to the vet already before she got spayed and basically got told that it might be due to environment or we could testing to see if it could be something medical. Have you gone through something similar? If so, what was it and how was it stopped?

1,CatAdvice,Making indoor/outdoor cat indoor only (with cat proof garden) after moving?,"Two weeks ago, I moved into a new home with my wife and my (nearly) 8 year old cat. 

In my previous house, I kept her inside only for the first year and a half of her life. Whilst I had to play with her for an hour after work, and a half an hour or so before bed, we made it work most of the time (she is prone to boredom), until she managed to get outside a few times. After that, she would cry at the front door every night. We didn't have a garden of our own, and didn't want to risk her roaming around wherever (despite it being common in the UK). She eventually started getting what seemed to be idiopathic cystitis. The vet told us it could be the stress from not being able to go outside that was causing it (in reality, it seemed due to the wooden pellets we were using in her litter tray, we found out much later). We made the decision to speak to all of our neighbours and asked if they were happy with her being in their garden, all of which were. I appreciate you can't really ever know how far you cat goes if you let them free roam, but she was almost always in view of our house. She went into the gardens directly next to and behind us. At the front of our house, the furthest she would go is about 10 meters in either direction, and almost never across the street.   


Our new house has a small garden, it also has a large public green space at the front of it (it's a cricket pitch for those who know how large they typically are). Whilst I knew dog walkers frequented the area, I had no idea it had become a space in which dog owners were exercising their dogs off lead/leash, and as such, some are often walk by my house without full control of their dog. I've spoken to the developer for the area (It's an up and coming town, with only the first phase of development completed) about how this potentially might cause a multitude of different issues, and they're going to raise it at their next meeting, but it's unlikely anything will be done until  they develop their specfic dog park area, which won't be any time soon.  
Luckily, so far, my cat hasn't shown an interest in going outside yet, but I know she will soon. My current house is twice the size of the old one, but I know it won't keep her entertained for much longer. I've been trying my best to play with her after work and before bed, but she quickly gets bored of any toys (I switch them out daily).  


My question is, do you think my cat would be content enough if I cat proof my small garden? It's about 8 x 6 meters. My gut tells me I would be stupid to let her free roam with the amount of dogs in the area out front, but everyone I've spoken to have told me it would ""probably"" be fine. If I cat proof my garden, I wouldn't be able to give her much in regards to vertical space as it would make the cat proofing useless and the area isn't large enough to do it in the middle of the garden, but she would at least have something outside, although no where near as stimulating as what she had before. I'm worried about her mental health, as she seems to get bored a lot (and she'll let you know it!), even before the move. If she hadn't had enough stimulation in the day, she would meow her head off in the night until one of us showed her any sort of attention. I appreciate mental health only really matters if you're not getting mauled to death by a dog...  


I appreciate this is probably a hard question for anyone to answer without knowing my cat and knowing the area, but I love my cat. I want the best for her, and I'd appreciate any opinions.",asddsaasddsaasddsaa,2022-11-05,20:28:50,2022,11,5,20,28,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,Gremlin Master Theif Orange cat-- how to keep him from committing crimes?,"I have a 3 month old orange kitten, and from day one he is incredibly persistent in stealing human food, whatever it may be. If he sees me opening a pack of biscuits, he will come up to investigate and plot his crime. Very cute, but also very annoying, and even inappropriate at times.

I have NEVER given any of my cats human food aside from boiled egg that I made specifically with the intent of giving to cats. However, this orange menace seems to know that he can eat human food, so he will try to steal. I usually keep him in the cat cage because of this, but he still manages to steal sometimes when we are having a snack. He always does this, and I don't quite know what to do to deter him from this habit aside from always cage him when we are having breakfast/lunch/dinner.

I would prefer if he learned that he's not supposed to and stop stalking me when I am having my usual coffee and bread. My other two cats (5 months) sniff at food, but they would never steal food (though they will pick up if you have any that fall to the ground accidentally) and they also turn away once I gently push them away from my food.

1,CatAdvice,"Looking for advice: our rescue cat follows strangers, breaks into houses and buildings like supermarkets, seems to get lost often and it is giving us a lot of stress","We adopted two cats from Greece this year, they are now a bit older than one year and both castrated/sterilised. They were found on the street when they were around 6 weeks old. While our female cat shows typical cat behaviour, our male cat really is an adventurer. Starting at around 8 months old he was roaming more and we noticed that he liked to follow us and strangers on walks. We don't mind that he likes to interact with strangers, however he seems to get lost frequently. He used to get posted in the local pet group on facebook weekly and now that he is wearing a necklace with our phone number, we get called around one to three times per week. Some tales of his adventures:
- he joins people for more than 1 hour walks. This is of course very entertaining to them. Several times he seemed to have followed different groups and got stranded more than 5 km away (this was during our holiday). When he is walking too far he doesn't seem to find his way back and seems very stressed.
- he is very vocal, likes attention and tries to break into houses 
- he also tried to break into supermarkets and kept breaking into a pharmacy 
- he jumps into cars and already got a car lift because people didn't notice he was in there
- he likes to hide in bushes and then jumps onto small dogs, probably because he wants to play (one lady here referenced him as ""oh the terror cat!"")
Luckily people in our neighborhood are very nice and attentive and keep calling us for him. 
This week he was gone for more than 24-40 hours on two occasions, which always makes us worry a) that he got lost again and b) that someone is catnapping him. It most often ends with us being called, sometimes us finding him somewhere or him finding his way back to us. Does anyone know why a cat would behave like he does and if there is anything we can do so that he doesn't get lost so often? We were thinking of giving him a GPS device (or maybe a navigation 😅), unfortunately they seem to be very bulky and he already hates his necklace. I have to say that when he is at home he does seem to be very happy with us and our service. We watched the cat documentary on Netflix and they talked about stray cats in Turkey briefly, which seem to have a whole infrastructure instead of one home. Maybe that applies for him as well and we need to accept it.",hoireka,2022-11-05,16:31:59,2022,11,5,16,31,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,Kittens playing turned to fighting?,"Let me preface this with the fact that I am a first time pet owner, but I’ve done a lot of research so I’m not doing this completely blind. 

I recently adopted 2 ragdoll kittens who are littermates. I’ve had them for about a week now and today while I was on the phone they were running around playing like normal. Then all of a sudden I noticed my one cat who was on the floor was looking up at her brother with an arched back completely stiff. The brother was on my bed just laying there at the edge, he didn’t look like he was going to pounce on her or anything until they made eye contact.

The brother jumps down in front of her and she began to hiss at him. Eventually it turns into chasing, biting, swatting and running away like their normal playtime, but every time he would approach she would arch her back until eventually the two of them were arched and running sideways at/away from each other. Once I realized they may be fighting I took out a feather wand with a bell on it to distract them which seemed to work, but now I’m a bit worried to leave them alone in the room, especially since they’ll be alone for the majority of the day tomorrow.

1,CatAdvice,cats don't get along - need advice,"henlo! okay I recently moved into a household that has one scaredy cat and I took my alpha cat with me. They are kept in separate rooms. Both cats go outside, but orange (scaredy pants) no longer goes out when tuxedo (my alpha cat) is out, so she barely goes now at all :( maybe only at night when my big boi is sleeping. They don't clash territories at all indoors but orange is always on alert when my room door is being open or closed. Sometimes her interest gets a better of her and she goes to sniff my door, but then she involuntarily gets angry and hisses (she is a gemini lol), so sometimes curious but very high alert. She even sometimes just slaps me because I smell like my cat and is only willing to come on my lap when her mom isn't home (she needy but scaredy lol). Okay so it's a bad situation.

My tuxedo cat is a huge floof and the orange one is smol. Both are 10yo tho but healthy and spirited. Tuxedo may or may not be aggressive towards her. He does chase cats outside, but to me it seems playful but I cannot be sure. Either way orange is scared of him. My tuxedo fights outside with another alpha cat who comes to his territory. But the other cats, he just looks with the same face he looks at a toy lol. So I think there's potential there but the orange is too scared to even give it a shot. 

I have been recommended Feliway and I wanna try it but I have few concerns about it.
1. I saw bunch of posts of ppl saying the diffuser started a fire or melted or something and this is bad. Also, the space is tight because of renovations (and is gonna be for a while) and there really isn't places it could fit since it has to be on the socket and not on extensions (idk if that's correct word) and I would feel very worried about two of them being on 24/7. One in my room and other where the orange cat with one brain cell and two personalities is. I would be especially worried if nobody was home. So that already makes it not possible for it to be on 24/7 and both cat spend lots of time outside the area(my cat), orange cat upstairs where nobody lives because it's not yet built, and my cat outside. So big spaces for both.  And lots of time them not inhaling the pheromones. Is my logic valid? 
2. This made me think of maybe collars being a better option, I saw someone recommended Feliway collar but it seems they don't make collars. I saw alternative brands making collars but are they effective? Which brands would you recommend? I live in EU but can order from US if they have better options.

So, plz advise. I know all about how to introduce cats slowly etc. Not going to force anything, but really wanting them to be able to chill together and share same spaces. Any ideas welcome.",darkalllday,2022-11-05,08:35:43,2022,11,5,8,35,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,Younger cat showing aggression/dominance towards older male cat,"Hi! I’m getting pretty stressed out by my current situation so thought I’d ask this in case there are others who faced a similar situation. 

I have two cats, M (6y/o) &amp; R (1 y/o). Both are male and are neutered. M was hospitalized last week for a possible UTI/blockage and is back home now. For the past 4 nights, M was confined in our room so that he can rest peacefully and so that R does not bother/stress him out. M has not gone out of the room within those 4 days, but R has occasionally entered a few times. In the few times he was in the room, he was a bit restless. He would run around, smell M’s items, and use M’s litter box. But he didn’t really do anything to annoy M. Also, this entire week he would CONSTANTLY meow outside of M’s room EVERYDAY/NIGHT. 

So I’m pretty sleep deprived because I’ve been taking care of M. He’s been waking up in the wee hours of the morning to urinate. These past two days, he has been super antsy and has been clawing to get out of the room. 

This morning, I decided to let M into the living room because I didn’t want the confinement to stress him out. It was the first time he’s looked so at peace since he got sick. For a good hour or so, everything was normal and the two slept in the living room. After their nap, R gets WILD.  He kept following M and did not let go of his gaze. He cried and meowed when he’s around M. At first, we thought he was acting like this because he missed M. Later on, he mounts on top of M and starts biting his neck. It happened 2-3 times. We tried to distract R with toys but it didn’t work. M doesn’t have the energy to fight back/assert his dominance, but he was clearly not having it. We immediately separated the two because I don’t want M to be stressed out. I put R in a room which he did NOT like and tried playing with him. The restlessness and meowing continued. 

I’m not sure why this is happening and what to do 😭 I’ve read online that this could be a sign of aggression/dominance which is normal for cats. But the thing is, M had already established dominance when we first brought R in last year. I’m not sure why R is acting anxious/aggressive all of a sudden. The time away they had from each other was about 1.5 weeks and I’m not sure if this had anything to do with it. They usually have a good relationship and don’t fight. I want them to be in the same room without stressing and possibly clawing each other out. I don’t want either to be stressed out. Has something similar happened to anyone, and if so how did you resolve it?",crumbledthoughts,2022-11-05,07:09:34,2022,11,5,7,9,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,Psychogenic Alopecia after getting a new cat.,"My cat has seemingly developed PA after we got a new cat a few months ago. Atleast we're assuming it's PA, she's always been a good groomer of herself but now it's crazy. Her stomach, part of her sides, groin, and tail are significantly shorter than the rest of her and we noticed it didn't start until after we got the new cat.

It's just strange, because she and the new cat get along well enough. They groom each other here and there and play, though he (new cat) is younger and does annoy her at times and tries to play when she doesn't want to, but she usually just up and goes away. 

I know the logical assumption here is. Get rid of the newer cat. But I'd honestly feel terrible doing so, he's such a sweetheart and I'd feel so bad turning him over to a shelter or rescue, especially since he's supposed to be going to my nephew when his mother gets a new place (whenever that is. it was supposed to be months ago.)

I've heard the Feliway System is good with relieving cat anxiety and fighting between cats and such (which would be a benefit for my oldest cat, who's a crotchety old lady who can't stand the boy) but what do you guys think? They're a little expensive for me at the moment so is there any alternatives? I've also heard of people using cat onesies which I'm sure she wouldn't mind terribly (she wears a harness outside just fine) but I have no clue where you can get those.",JustOne-Chance,2022-11-05,01:45:50,2022,11,5,1,45,Saturday

1,CatAdvice,Returned kitten - will he remember me after 2 weeks?,"Hey all…

I got my 6 month old kitten 2 weeks ago, and after much thought, reluctancy, and anguish, I returned him to his foster mom yesterday. I live in a small apartment by myself, with no other pets, and I could tell he needed much more stimulation than I was able to provide, preferably from another kitty friend. Overall, he was a good boy and I made some good memories with him in those 2 weeks. 

Yesterday was hard. He was stressing out from the drive since it was storming, and when I finally got there to give him up, he looked scared and confused. I rushed because I was about to cry in front of everyone and it was extremely hard to do. I came back home to his stuff scattered everywhere, but not him. 

It’s still just as hard today. I’m wondering if I did the right thing, and if I caused him any trauma. Will he remember me, or even miss me after those 2 weeks? I want him to be happy, even if that means completely forgetting me. It broke my heart. 

The foster mom said she was introducing him to a kitten when they got back to her place, which made me happy for him, but I know it’s not permanent and he will be adopted quickly. He doesn’t deserve to be taken from house to house and I feel like such a terrible person. I’ll miss you buddy.",GallopingFinger,2022-11-04,23:34:21,2022,11,4,23,34,Friday
1,CatAdvice,My two cats disappeared two days ago,"Cat and dog stealing is common in my country, where there is still no regulation against eating and selling these pets’ meat.  I raised many cats before, and no matter how careful I was, I kept losing cats to those thieves. They would wait until the cats were chubby and snatched them from me. It broke my heart every time my lovely cats disappeared. I tried to search for them in vain.

Here is some information about the cats I recently lost to the thieves:
About four years ago, I adopted a mixed Magpie cat when the cat was a kitten. Then she gave birth to some kitties before I neutered her. I kept two kitties and gave my friends and relatives the others. So, I used to have three cats living with me: a mother cat named Snowbelle, a 3-year-old male cat named Frawzadam, and a 1-year-old female cat named Yukitsu. All of them had been neutered. They were the most adorable cats I had ever owned. I loved how they interacted as a family. And then two days ago, Frawzadam and Yukitsu disappeared at the same time. I felt something was wrong since the cats never hung out overnight outside of the house like that. I posted on social media looking for my cats, only to find many other cats and dogs in my city also got stolen from their owners.

1,CatAdvice,"Is this normal, or have I caused these issues?","I’ve had my cat (2year old male) for about 8 months. Recently his behavior has started to change. If he gets in trouble or is not allowed to do something, he will go and push things off the shelves. He has broken three things this week alone because I wouldn't let him go outside when it was dark. He has also started biting to communicate when he is done being petted or being near my dog for a long time (has started swatting at her). He used to just get up and leave. I don’t know what to do anymore. In the last month, he has broken almost every breakable thing in my house.

I’m thinking about potentially rehoming him. A lady I work with is great with cats and is great with training them. I just know it’s on me because I don’t know how to train this cat. I’ve watched Jackson Galaxy, but in the end, he is still just vindictive.

1,CatAdvice,Update: Elimination issues dilemma,"I’ve posted about my cat biscuit [here before](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/w7wt2r/advice_needed_my_cat_refuses_to_consistently_use/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and received lots of suggestions and advice from fellow cat lovers. Unfortunately, none of the suggested changes or interventions worked and we are not only still in the same predicament but are now facing additional issues.    

Biscuit escalated to peeing on our things in the basement, so we had to lock both cats out of the basement and guide them to use the litter boxes upstairs. Leopold took it in stride, but biscuit continued to pee on the floor. At first it was at least in the right area, but quickly it moved to wherever in the house she wanted. After a couple days of having her pee on the floor right in front of us, we were resigned and decided we could take no more. But right as we decided, we noticed blood-tinged urine and immediately took her to the vet. They took a sample which came back positive for oxalate crystals. We asked the vet if resolving this would fix her elimination issues and he replied that it might, but it might not. We also asked him if this is something she could have had all along and he said it was possible, but unlikely. He suggested we change her food and give her 3 months. Knowing that we absolutely would not survive 3 months of her peeing all over our house, my partner built her a two-level house with a “litter box area” that we could put in a separate room so that we could better control where she pees (note: her urine being everywhere has also become very distressing to our other cat, so it was imperative we keep it away from him). For the first couple days she did okay. We make sure to visit her and play, put on cat TV, and let her out of the box and into the room (still separate from the rest of the house) for a few hours throughout the day so she can sit at the windows and get a bit more stimuli. During this time, she continued (and still continues) to pee on the floor anytime she’s out of the box.  Recently her demeanor has changed, and she is obviously unhappy. We don’t think she can make it (mental health wise) the 3 months it will likely take (if not more) to help with her bladder crystals. We also learned that she likely has bladder stones and will require imaging for confirmation and then stone removal surgery which we cannot afford. On top of this it is unlikely that her behavioral elimination issues will resolve with the bladder crystals/stones because she’s had the behaviors for so long. We are at a loss. We know we have to give her up because this is not healthy for her or for us. She cannot stay in the box, and we can’t let her loose in the house. She likely needs further medical intervention, but we can’t afford it, and no one wants to take a cat with medical issues AND elimination issues.   

We are looking for options that don’t mean that we’re sending her to die. Somewhere she can go and keep up with the new food to see if it will help without surgery. But also, somewhere she doesn’t have to be locked away and can enjoy more frequent interaction. Somewhere she might be able to learn to use a litter box again, or at least learn to use it more consistently. We’ve done all we can think of, but we’re officially out of resources and it’s heartbreaking. Any recommendations or suggestions are welcome.",randomoscityy,2022-11-04,21:30:32,2022,11,4,21,30,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Cat Keeps Licking Floor,"I've had an adult male rescue (\~4 years old) for about a year now. This is the first cat I've ever owned. While he's generally well-behaved, he's gotten into the habit of licking our wooden flooring (varnished), which makes walking around barefoot or in socks a pretty risky affair.   


We recently took him for his annual physical and he came back with a clean bill of health, so I doubt this is due to a nutritional deficiency. We feed him the amount recommended by most vets and also give him the occasional snack. He drinks plenty of water. We play with him 30 min to an hour a day, so I doubt it's boredom. I wipe the floor with a citrus-scented cleaning solution (which he hates) multiple times a day. I've even set up a couple of catnip balls around the apartment so he has something else to lick instead.  


Yet he still licks the floor constantly, leaving hard-to-see saliva traps for our unsuspecting feet.

1,CatAdvice,Training Bengal Brothers,"My wife and I were given two Bengal cats from a friend of a friend because she was not able to stay home with them enough (going on work trips, going out,etc). We have had these 2 male cats (both neutered) for three months. They are both around two years old. After moving these cats to our house, one of the cats constantly pees on the couch without fail but never in front of me or my wife.

1,CatAdvice,Cat is jealous of my boyfriend,"So my little Bilbo Baggins is a much loved and adored cat. She is about 18mo old, and has always slept in bed with me and cuddled with me the entire night.  
I've been seeing someone for about 5/6 months now, and every time he stays over, she plays up. She keeps us awake all night. She will smash things, knock stuff off the bedside tables, pluck the mattress and headboard, jump on him, bite him. If I shut her out of the room she throws herself against the door. It's impossible to get any sleep unless I put her in the spare room, which I've only done once or twice as a last resort after hours of trying to calm her down.

When he isn't there, she is fantastic and will sleep and cuddle with me through the entire night until I get up in the morning, but is an absolute NIGHTMARE when he is around.  
Does anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this? It's been going on for months. I've tried feliway but hasn't worked...",_JazminBianca,2022-11-04,15:53:56,2022,11,4,15,53,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Does anyone else have cats that don't purr?,"Hello everyone!

I'm not sure if this is qualified as asking for medical advice or not, but I did make a separate but somewhat related post on r/AskVet and have consulted my cat's actual vet as well.

Anyway, my cat is 6 yo and she never purrs. I've googled and applied every advice to maybe inspire my cat to purr, but she just never does. She clearly enjoys the chin and butt scratches but she just doesn't purr.

I will add that I noticed the behavior after she was spayed (hence the AskVet post). But, when I asked the vet about it. They told me that some cats just don't like purring and just express themselves in other ways.

I guess this post is to find out if there are others like me, who also crave the sweet satisfaction of watching cat purr, but sadly, their cats just never do. So, does anyone else have a cat that just doesn't purr?",VioletIsNotPurple,2022-11-04,15:03:43,2022,11,4,15,3,Friday

1,CatAdvice,Kitten is hard to get to know,"This might be one of those dumb questions. I’m having a hard time getting to know my kitten. Yesterday was 5 months since I got her, and she is 6.5 months old now. She weighs 7.5 pounds. 

For awhile I told myself she was still developing her personality. Then the vet said a few months ago, oh, she has a personality now. But I can’t figure her out. She doesn’t like to be held, she doesn’t kiss me, she is very picky about food, she gets rough with the resident cat (who is only 5 pounds) and then, when I walk in the room to stop the “fight”, the kitten rolls her eyes at me. She doesn’t even pretend like she wasn’t bothering the cat.  I try having special activities with just us, but it doesn’t last long. 

Sometimes, she’ll come over and make biscuits on me, but it just doesn’t feel as much of a warm vibe as with my cat. I just can’t read this kitten. I’m usually able to figure out the kitty personality, but not this one.

It really is bothering me. I don’t know even how to fully explain it. I usually have cats that are extremely friendly or very aggressive or very fun to play with. They’re just easy to describe and figure out. Could it be that the kitten is just boring?

He's been hanging out in my sister's room with her while he is quarantined, but it's been a challenge for her to leave the room to do anything for a short period of time. 

My parents both think it's an amazing idea to stomp/bang things/yell whenever he cries, since they believed it worked out so well for the other cat we have and their kids.

We believe he's crying for attention because his basics are covered: food, water, litterbox, toys, cat tree, etc.

My sister and I have been trying to teach him to be quiet before receiving more attention by allowing him to cry and withholding affection until he stops meowing, even for a brief moment, before rewarding him with affection. This doesn't seem to be working that well and my parents truly don't understand how this method could possibly ever work, is there anything else we can do?

I clean the spot she pees at with white vinegar to deter her. 
Nothing has changed, she still pees and often poops outside of all her litter boxes, unless I stand up when I hear she’s about to go and then she runs in one of them to do her business.

1,CatAdvice,Cat and Dog are not friends! (crossposted),"*My veterinarian is involved; we've had two visits to discuss the problem so far - I am looking for advice from people who have experienced this problem or have insight to share as cat lovers - *not* medical advice*

I have an indoor/outdoor cat, about 3 years old, female white DLH. We live in a unique setup that lets me be comfortable allowing her outside (we're well away from the road, the road itself is slow and has little traffic, but at the same time predation is unlikely because there is a lot of activity around the house including things like horses and tractors and dogs and humans at all hours, so wild animals mostly steer clear. Nonetheless, I prefer that Hitty Pitty sleep indoors at night.

When I got Hitty, I already had a big rambunctious dog, and she warmed up to him quickly. He will go running right up to her and screech to a halt and she'll sit there indifferently as he gallops up, mew at him, allow him to sniff her, and then rub up against his legs as he stands there wagging his tail. Sometimes when it's cold she'll sleep right on top of him. So I thought she would warm up to the new puppy right away.

She did not.

They have had a couple of traumatic incidents when he went running up to her, she ran, and he chased - and now she avoids him at all costs. I put her food and water on top of the kitchen cabinets, where there is a big area for her to walk around and look down at the kitchen and living room. I assumed that this would help her warm up to him, but it didn't - over time she stopped coming inside at all. A few times I carried her inside and set her up on the cabinet with her food and water, but she just bolted down and hid under the couch closest to the back door and waited for her chance to bail. I tried Feliway spray and noticed no change.

Recently my vet had me start her on Fluoxetine. We have a routine now where she meets me on the front porch in the evening, I pill her and feed her and hang out with her while she eats, but she won't come in the front door voluntarily, even with the puppy crated. I've tried carrying her in but she just runs under the couch and waits for her chance to bolt out the back door. 

I'm so sad to see her so unhappy. I'm worried about her staying out at night, and I just feel bad as it gets colder (it is not so cold as to be unsafe, she just sleeps in the rafters in the barn, but it's not great.) Honestly, if I had known how hard this would be for her I might have reconsidered getting the puppy, but he is family now too and I'm trying to mend the situation.

What would you do? She's been on the Fluoxetine for about ten days. What I have in mind is to wait another week or so to let the meds start working, and then bring her in and contain her in the spare bedroom so she can hear and smell the puppy without having to face him, for maybe a week or two, and then try bringing her into the rest of the house, maybe with the puppy crated so she can see him but he can't approach her? 

Any input is appreciated.",Goddamtoad,2022-11-04,13:09:01,2022,11,4,13,9,Friday
1,CatAdvice,"Would it be better to take my cat on a 2,000 mile drive and back, or leave her (10-15 days) with automatic feeder?","So my husband and I are driving from Colorado to South Carolina to see family for Christmas. My question is, would it be more stressful to take the cat on a 4,000 mile trip (2,000 miles there 2,000 miles back) or to leave her alone for about 15 days? My cat gets stressed around other animals (but tolerates our dog just fine). She would be staying in a house with 2 other cats and 3 dogs (including ours) for about a week. She's lived with them before but never ever came out of my bedroom. We've made the drive before, but she didn't eat, drink or potty for the entire 3 days it took. So I'm wondering if it would be simpler and easier on her if we just left her and got an automatic wifi feeder that times and portions her food, and a gravity fed (5liter) water dispenser. 

On one hand, I'd be stressing her out with the drive/new environment. But on the other hand, she's going to be left alone for an extended period of time which might also stress her out. We don't have any friends to watch her so I feel like it's our only two options. It might sound crazy to leave her for so long, but I'm really not sure how it impacts the cat since they're seemingly solitary creatures. I can't tell if it's an awful idea or not to leave her. 

*Side note, the feeder I've looked into has safety nets where it still works on previous setting when without power or wifi 


Tldr; 
Going on a 10-15 day trip which includes a total of 4,000 miles and putting my cat around animals she doesn't like

1,CatAdvice,Leaving a kitten alone at home,"I haven't actually gotten a kitten yet, but I am planning on getting a specific one from a registered breeder, a breed that I have wanted for almost 40 years. While I've tried to look for adult rescues of this breed, they are adopted quickly.

The problem is, while I work from home mostly and am never gone more than 2 to 3 hours at most usually, I have to go to the office 2 days of the week and with the commute, I'm gone about 9 hours, around 7:30 to 4:30.  It's nearly a 45 minute commute so travelling back and forth isn't an option. 

I can kittenproof my apartment and am planning on protecting all the wires, blocking off any hidey-holes and making sure there's lots of toys and fun around while being as safe as possible, but unfortunately the landlord forbids more than one animal, so a companion isn't an option. 

The kitten would be adopted at 8 or 9 weeks and while I can occasionally split my day to work from home, I'm worried I'm being cruel by even considering getting the kitten because I have a job and can't always be there for them.

1,CatAdvice,Why has my relatively unfriendly cat become so affectionate?,"I enjoy spending more time with my cat, but it’s a bit strange. 

I’ve had my cat for 5 years, (adopted at 2 yrs, 7 now) and over the past year and a half, she just keeps becoming more and more friendly and cuddly. This is very out of character as she would only ever be seen around my family or me when she was fed. She was also quick to scratch or bite when being pet.

I would also like to add that she only comes to me for attention, and will only go to someone else if I am not home.

I thought maybe it could have been due to lockdown and she was unable to avoid us, but my family (and especially me) have been really busy lately and she seems to be getting even more friendly. She’s spayed, has no health issues, and is an indoor cat (but sometimes escapes) 

Could it be age? Or maybe it just took that long for her to feel comfortable in our house? Has anyone else experienced this?

1,CatAdvice,UPDATE New cat STILL not using litterbox. Tried everything. Help.,"Hey, I still need help. I'll repost my other post here with some edits so you can understand the situation.  : Hi there. I recently adopted a cat, newly neutered and we've had him for over two weeks?  so far. The vet said he can't be more than a year old.  Everything is going well so far, except for him not using the litter  box. He pees and poops in the same spots. We've been using feliway diffuser, cat attract litter (along with many other kinds) bought two litter boxes and moving them over  the spots he's using, using cleaner specifically for cleaning up pet  messes. We've tried putting him in the box but he refuses to get inside,  he spreads his paws on the edges so he doesn't touch the litter. We've used every kind of litter, he won't use them. We had a little bit of success with putting puppy pads into the litter box, but it's not a long term solution. And now he doesn't use the pad anymore. He sits down and squats in them, and then suddenly decides the rug is a better place. He is a  stray cat we've known for months but decided to take in. He's been  neutered and has gotten every vaccine and checkup needed, he's very  healthy, with clean bloodwork. He doesn't seem as stressed as before. I  don't know what to do now. I love him and don't want to get rid of him, I  want him to use the litterbox. We have another cat but we have them  separated most of the time. **Please help!** **We're at our limit.** We contacted our vet, and they believe that the issue is behavioral. We've been searching the internet for every solution, it's weighing heavily on us and we really don't know what to do anymore.",sleeping-all-day,2022-11-04,05:23:31,2022,11,4,5,23,Friday

1,CatAdvice,I need help with my aggressive 7 month old.,"Hi all, my fiance and I adopted our little girl when she was 1 month old and loved her instantly. 

She’s always been a bit playful, and would nip at our hands during playtime and lightly scratch but then would lick right after. 

Then, around 3 months ago, she started to hide and jump out and scratch/bite anyone who walked past. 

At the beginning of October, we moved and the aggression got worse. She has begun hissing and growling at us when we pick her up and the scratching and biting when we walk near her has gotten much worse and more painful. We definitely thought the move stressed her out, but she also seemed to get very accustomed to the new place and has various spots she likes to lay at. She has plenty of toys of different materials, but the toys that have stuffing she seems to tear into and destroy. 

When she isn’t being aggressive, she is otherwise a very sweet and sociable cat. At night she sleeps directly on top of or next to us. She greets us when we come in and responds when we call her. She purrs when she’s around us and when we pick her up, when she’s not hissing and growling. 

Can anyone give me any advice or suggestions on how to tone this behavior down?",pinkfeline,2022-11-04,04:37:15,2022,11,4,4,37,Friday
1,CatAdvice,Need advice on kittens behavior,"Hi everyone! My partner and I adopted a 12 week old orange tabby about a month ago. He was rescued when he was 2 weeks old and was bottle fed. 

He is a lovely, crazy boy and is not shy whatsoever. He had no problem adjusting to his new home and LOVES when people are over. He definitely has tons of energy so we try our best to play with him when we’re home, but we both work full time so he does spend a good majority of his day in his room (where all his toys, litter box, bed, etc) are. The reason for this is that he gets into absolutely everything and is a “trouble maker”, which is where some of our concerns/questions stem from. 

1. We have a few plants that he loves to eat/mess with. We keep them up on a plant stand but it isn’t enough to deter him from trying to get to them. How can we discourage this behavior? Are there any sprays, etc. that we can use?
2. We cannot eat around him. He will try to snatch our food or get into our drinks. We say “no” or hiss (recommended by vet) but nothing seems to phase him. How do we prevent this? 
3. He also seems to eat everything and anything off the floor. I even caught him with an earring in his mouth that he took from our cabinet. He eats throughout the day so I don’t think it’s in relation to being hungry. What can we do about this? 
4. Recently, he’s been getting more aggressive with his biting. His foster mom said he was a nibbler but it seems to be getting worse. Today he was laying on my lap when he starts biting me all of a sudden. He lunged at my face and managed to bit my palm deep enough to draw blood. He has done this twice within the last 2-3 days now. He was at the vet last week and is completely healthy. He has never bitten this hard or seemed “aggressive”. What could be causing this and how can I show him it’s not appropriate? Hissing or saying “no” have no effect on him so I’ve been placing him in his room for “timeout” when he displays this type of behavior. Is this an appropriate solution? 

I’ve read having a second kitten in the home could be beneficial but sadly our landlord limits pets to 1 per apartment so it’s not an option at this time. What are some other solutions we can try to implement?",IcyTaste9,2022-11-04,04:30:37,2022,11,4,4,30,Friday

1,CatAdvice,One cat won't stop splashing water everywhere and flooding my living room,"We had two snow bengals. One is a blind kitten and she only makes a mess on accident. The other is ~1.5yrs old and she's a water terrorist.

The older one regularly pushes the fountain far enough from the wall that it unplugs, and then she gets mad at it for not working and attacks it. This morning around 6am she dumped the entirety of a fresh Catit fountain on the floor, and three towels was barely enough to clean it up. Then she splashed _all_ of the water out of a standard cat bowl. I filled up both last night before going to bed, so they were fresh and clean.

We had a heavy ceramic fountain but she flooded the room twice by swatting one of the towers so it rotated and dumped water onto the floor instead of into the fountain, and then while cleaning it she jumped onto the counter to knock off a tower, shattering it into a million pieces, so the Catit was the replacement.

I plan on getting a wide bin and putting the Catit fountain in it so _when_ it gets knocked over again, it's at least contained, but this doesn't get to the root of the problem.

Why does she want to splash the water? Why does she shove the fountains around? The fountain is far away from food and litter, the water is refreshed frequently, water quality here is very good. I would like to know how to make her happy and have her stop ruining my mornings.",zeekaran,2022-11-04,02:39:04,2022,11,4,2,39,Friday
1,CatAdvice,Tips for spay + neuter recovery of a bonded sibling pair?,"Hi Folks,

In about a week and a half, my male/female sibling pair will go in for neutering and spaying surgeries respectively. They'll be just about 4 months old when they go in (like 4 months and 3 days, ha).

They are EXTREMELY attached to each other, and both cry constantly if separated. I'm also aware that the girl's recovery will be longer and more intensive than the boy's.... 

Any tips for managing their recovery safely? They have a safe room where they go to sleep at night. I am considering getting a large dog crate to keep a bed/water/litter box in and having them take turns being in the crate when I can't watch them to ensure there is no rough housing play that could get too intense. At least this way they can still see each other and be in the same room...? I'm really reluctant to separate them because they're so close.

Any ideas or tips would be much appreciated, I'm stressed about her recovery in particular! Thank you!",TempusCrystallum,2022-11-04,02:04:41,2022,11,4,2,4,Friday
1,CatAdvice,Cat just started having litter box zoomies,"I adopted her a few months back, and she hasn’t had any issues with the litter box until this past week.

The litter box is in my bathroom, which is connected to my room. She steps out, turns 180 degrees and lunges into my room(it’s one step down).  She then starts to play around with the litter for a second or 2. She does this about 3-4 times a night. The main issue with it is that it’s tracking way more cat litter into the room. When she rushes in, I can hear the cat litter going everywhere (hard wood floors).  I already had one mat down that was helping, but ever since she started going crazy after using the box, it doesn’t seem to help, even after adding a second one. 

Her diet hasn’t changed. Using the same litter as before. Plenty of #1 and #2 in the box.

I’m currently leaving the door open, but maybe a cat door will stop her from rushing into my room and tracking so much? Any other advice? I feed her in the morning before work at about 5am.

1,CatAdvice,Need advice for addressing long-term litterbox issues,"Hi everyone,

I did see that litterbox posts are not allowed unless medical causes have been ruled out. My cat, Pepper, is 14 and has had trouble using the litterbox regularly since she was 3 months old. She has been to the vet regularly in that time, most recently a few weeks ago where they did a urine test. So I feel comfortable saying it's not (primarily) medical.

So Pepper is 14, she was spayed around 6 months, and has never been consistent with a litterbox. When she was a kitten she would pee outside the litterbox, on the carpet. When she was ~2 we moved to California and my dad started letting her outside. Her litterbox issues were greatly reduced at this time as she mostly went outside. When she was 7 I realized how bad indoor/outdoor cats are for the cat &amp; the environment and kept her indoor only. I've done my best to stay on top of enrichment needs.

When she was 9, I went to college and I took her with me. So between then and now, we have moved around frequently. She's a very confident cat and usually is not phased by moving, she settles in quickly and tends to be good about using the box for the first day or two. 

If I'm watching her consistently, I can discourage her from going in other places, but I can't watch her 24/7. Another thing I've done for the past couple years is give her a treat whenever she uses the litterbox. I don't punish her or yell at her when she has accidents. I clean them up ASAP and use Nature's Miracle. But I think she can still smell the spots, because she'll continue to go in that area unless I restrict access to it.

Most recently, I've had to move into a house with 3 other cats. Pepper is restricted to one room because of her accidents and because she doesn't like other cats. The room is relatively small. I'm working, so I can't be here all the time, and more often than not I come home to find pee on the bed. I'm frustrated, I feel like I've tried everything, and I need advice.

1,CatAdvice,Rescues for Aggressive Cats?,"My aunt has asked me to post this. She lives in Chesapeake, VA. She has an 8 y/o spayed gray and white medium hair tabby that she's trying to find a new home for.

She also has a 2-3 year old neutered black medium hair that she wants to rehome.

Her family fell on hard times and now she'll only be allowed to keep 2 of her 6 cats (two are staying with her, two are heading to a relative's house, and 2 have no place to go). The black cat I feel will find a home pretty easily. He's young and cute and his only negative quality is that he's a troublemaker with the other cats. I would take him myself if I wasn't at cat capacity.

My aunt says her gray and white ""Hermione"" is sweet when given one-on-one attention and would be best in home with either no other cats or one other cat. Hermione was rescued at 4 weeks old from the middle of a neighborhood street by my aunt, and so she was a bottle baby. I remember her being very sweet as a kitten. As an adult, Hermione is aggressive and very solitary, and all it takes for her to attack you is being in her space (like, standing close to where she sits). She isn't a cat that likes attention unless she initiates it. She's also territorial, and will sometimes walk over to someone to hiss, swat, and bite. It has only gotten worse with more furry additions. She starts fights with other cats in the house and it'd be better for everyone if she found a place to live out her retirement years in peace.

My question is: Are there any rescues that work with aggressive cats like Hermione? Also, if anyone is interested in helping Hermione, they can send me a message. I have pictures. She's very cute.",Tayzerbeam,2022-11-04,01:10:33,2022,11,4,1,10,Friday

1,CatAdvice,2 1/2yr old F suddenly being mean to her 2yr old sister,"(first post ever on reddit so i hope i’m doing this correctly!)

hi everyone! i’m hoping to get some advice on our situation. for some background my wife and i have 2 female cats (freya &amp; dobby) almost a year apart (both spayed and indoor only), and while not from the same litter, from the same “family” (ie neighborhood cats that had litters. we’re pretty sure they’re most likely aunt/niece). they’ve never really had any issues and they basically have grown up together (i believe we got our second when our oldest freya was around 9 months). 

we are located in southern california in a very small apartment, but we make sure to have two large litter boxes, a fairly tall and large tower and multiple toys and hiding places for them (they like their tents and tunnels). their food bowls are also separated (freya even has a fancy bowl that opens for her microchip, thanks to a gift from my best friend).

they are both current on their health checks (on a wellness plan), and freya even has an upcoming routine check up. we know it could be medical, but we’re thinking it could be stress/aggression that freya is relating dobby to.

here’s why we think this:

within the last year we recently had a new neighbor move in at the end of our apartment block. she got a male kitten, and once he got older (maybe 6-9 months?) we started seeing/hearing him outside. after letting her know multiple times (out of concern- there’s a field nearby with coyotes that frequently come by our residence) she then admitted he will “now be an indoor/outdoor cat”. turns out this girl doesn’t know how to have a cat at all. we rarely see him inside and he now walks past our apartment frequently (we’ve even caught him on our doorbell camera trying to jump into our tomato planters). and seeing as how we have our girls, we’re 99% sure he’s been spraying as well.

we’ve trying shooing him away, tried spraying the “no spray” around our patio, but we’re not sure it’s making a difference. 

when freya has seen him through our screen door before she got very defensive (but not when a stray girl cat had wandered by one day). 

we know it’s most likely territorial, but we’re at our wits end with how to make her feel comfortable and calm. we can’t keep our door closed all the time as it’s finally nice weather here and our girls love watching the hummingbirds outside. 

freya isn’t a mean cat, she’s very sweet. so this “grumpy” phase she’s got going has been very stressful. and dobby doesn’t know why her sister keeps running away from her and hissing and occasionally swatting at her, she just wants to run and play with her like normal.

we have a prescription of gabapentin that we use when she really stressed, we always have the feliway diffuser on and she gets plenty of love. is there anything else we can do?

hi, my cat is 10, spayed female, great health, and shes the only pet i have, and she's used to it being only me and her. she takes a long time to warm up to people i bring around but will usually just sit and watch us from afar, still spending time with us and getting pets occasionally. but, for some reason she really hates my boyfriend, ive never been affectionate with anyone before, that might play into it? i think she feels jealous or replaced, and upset that hes in her space for a week at a time. but she wont stay in the room with us unless shes hungry, and she GROWLS when he pets her sometimes, so i keep them separate, she always has a safe place to hide, but i hate that she doesnt want to be near us and is potentially anxious.  
 my boyfriend is very very quiet and slow and gentle and had cats before, so its not him. i sat with them both the first time they met and he fed her and played with her, and ONCE she slept in the bed with us? but she just hasnt come around. its been months.   
after some research i think i may have introduced them wrong? is there anything i can do to ease her into being around him too? he's coming over this week and moving in soon, and i'd like to work with him and my cat to get them to bond a bit.  
she can be pretty sensitive to change but usually owns whatever situation shes in after a lot of babying, is that what she needs? my boyfriend really loves her and wants her to be happy around him. thank you in advance !

About 2 months ago, he showed back up on my porch. I'm happy that he's back, but when I had lost hope in seeing him again, I adopted two kittens.

1,CatAdvice,Cats started fighting each other HELP,"This is probably going to be a pretty long post so I'm sorry in advance but I'm really at my wits end of what to do :/

For some background,  back in June I moved in with some family members with my 2 year old neutered male Aries. The household already had cats living in it (9 in total not counting my boy), which I knew and was prepared for. Socializing them was a little bumpy in the beginning, but I expected it since Aries was in an entirely different place with different cats, and his sister had just died a couple weeks before from some pretty serious health issues. After about a month or two we were in a good spot with his behavior.

Anyways Aries was doing really well with all the other cats in the house, and I was really proud of him until about a month or so ago when out of nowhere he started attacking one of the other cats Ella on sight. Before this, Aries actually really liked Ella, and she never had any issues with him either. One night I had brought Ella into my room so that my partner could say hi to her before I brought her upstairs to sleep. This wasn't out of the usual, and Aries is used to other cats being in his room, so I didn't really  think anything of it. For some reason it really bothered him this one time and he was growling and even tried jumping up to bat at her. I took her out pretty much immediately because it was really weird behavior for him and put her upstairs with her person. 

After the weird incident in the bedroom we didn't think much of it because we went on a week-long camping trip, and ended up taking Aries with us because he hurt his leg and we needed to monitor him(he's all healed and healthy now after a $900 vet visit lol). After that was over they were cautious but civil around each other, but one day I heard screaming and banging from the other side of the house. I found them both locked on to the other in a ball fighting. I broke it up and put them in their separate rooms but ever since its been on sight with these two and I don't know what to do. Separately they're both the sweetest and most loving cats ever,  but every time they see each other I have to physically pull them apart because they fight so intensely. I'm talking fur flying, puffy tails, things knocked over, they're on tables, cat trees, floors literally any time anywhere they see each other its violence, and every time they fight Ella pees herself and we have to clean them both off. Neither of them are ever injured with the exception of Aries breaking two claws in a fight, but they shouldn't be fighting anyways and I'm worried about what might happen every time I leave the house.

We've been keeping them on opposite sides of the house when possible, or in each others rooms when the other is out, but Ellas human recently had her door taken away for safety issues and the problem is really worrying me. I think it might be important to note that they're the only two tuxedo cats in the house, and Aries isn't the smartest cat in the world by ANY means, and so at first we thought that he was freaking out because he thought his mirror man was out or something, but it's definitely NOT that. Things had gotten better for awhile while we were trying to resocialize them, but with Ella not having her own private space anymore it's been hard and it's happening like once a week. 

I feel so bad for this poor girl she absolutely does not deserve it, and as it's progressed I noticed Ella actually starting some of the fights, and earlier I could barely get Aries off of her because she had grappled onto him so hard and kept biting. I don't know what to do at all and it's so overwhelming for me so I can't even imagine how these cats are feeling...

I've had cats my whole life and have never had this problem before, and the cats don't have this problem with anyone else. They also only fight when they're both on the same level, like if Ella is on the cat tree and Aries is on the floor they're fine, or if one of them is being held or on a table, etc. It's literally only when they're on the same plane but when they are it's on sight and I'm feeling so lost but rehoming either of them is not an option, please help!!

TLDR: two of the ten cats in the house keep beating each other up every time they see them for seemingly no reason other than f*ck it, we ball, and I don't know what to do",inkoowoo,2022-11-03,15:28:08,2022,11,3,15,28,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,Similar to Fancy Feast Gourmet Naturals?,"I am trying to keep my cat on a wet food diet, and it seems to be agreeing with him. The only downside is that I am a full time student and so wet food can get kind of pricey. I do work and save as much as  I can, but I also have bills/rent/gas/etc. Luckily, the Gourmet Naturals line is SUPER affordable and that's all I've been using.

My question is if there are any other wet foods you can recommend that are in a similar range for price/quality? I am sticking to the Gourmet Naturals for now but I always want to be prepared in case they discontinue the line or if it gets harder to find. And it never hurts to give my boy some variety.",Usual_Fox565,2022-11-03,13:48:08,2022,11,3,13,48,Thursday
1,CatAdvice,I put my cats on a diet and we’re all struggling,"I have two adult cats age 3 and 4. They are both overweight, they’re an 8/9 on the body condition scale and I believe the ideal range is 4-5. 
One of them has severe asthma, and he doesn’t tolerate an inhaler so we have to have him on a low dose of a steroid long term. This medication puts him at risk for diabetes and weight gain, so the vet encouraged us to start to reduce his food intake to help lower the risk. 

We’re doing the same for our other cat as well. Before they were each eating 1/4 cup of dry food 3 times a day. The vet recommended that we cut one of the meals in half to 1/8 cup, and we’ve also gotten more disciplined about sticking to a schedule using our auto feeder and not giving them food outside of meal times. 

I’m really surprised how much they’re struggling to adjust. It’s been about 5 days and they’re constantly meowing and following us around, especially 2 hours before meal times. Other times they are suddenly extra snuggly and lovey, I think trying to get us to feed them more. 

I keep our bag of cat food on a very tall shelf in a closet, and this morning I woke up to a crinkling sound. I walked out and they somehow opened the closet door, got up on the shelf and knocked the bag down. They were both trying to open it to get food. I have no idea how they did it - it was kind of funny to catch them in the act but also, it broke my heart. Imagining them being hungry enough to go to such an extreme measure really made me question everything and feel like a horrible cat mom.

I’m debating whether I should only cut their middle meal by 1/4 to start with and then try again to go down to half after a few weeks, or if I just need to stay strong until they adjust. Any advice appreciated, I’m feeling so guilty but I know they absolutely need this to live long healthy lives.",socker18,2022-11-03,13:03:50,2022,11,3,13,3,Thursday
1,CatAdvice,cat won't stop running out,"Hello! I have a fixed 1.5 year old male that won't stop running outside. He was originally an inside cat and my dad made him stay outside for a few months after we got him. He was brought in last fall and we have had a problem with him running out. This is not a huge deal at my dads house since we have 4 acres and there aren't many cars, etc around. He is perfectly content to be inside when I am home and runs in when I get home from work each night. He usually does not try to run out when I am home. He is a total lap cat and was bottlefed. He follows me around the house and sleeps with me some nights (especially when i am off work). I will be moving to a large city and am trying to break him from going outside to prepare for this as it will not be safe outside for him in that environment. I have been looking into petsafe threshold barriers or electric fences (we have a porch and I would like for him to be able to sit on it so I like the idea of a fence more than a doorway barrier) I have a cat tree with a hammock in front of my window and plenty of toys and a scratching post all of which he uses.

 I was wondering if anyone has experience with this? Are they even safe for cats? Does anyone have any advice on deterring my fur baby from running out? I am concerned only for his safety and really want to avoid any kind of shock-based system if I can but I'm starting to feel like I'm running out of options.",Jessikared97,2022-11-03,13:00:34,2022,11,3,13,0,Thursday
1,CatAdvice,Ways for senior cats to get up to high windows?,"My 16 yr old kitty and I just moved to a new house. We used to have a large glass sliding door and a window low enough she could see out of it while on the bed. Unfortunately, all of the windows are up much higher now And she can't see out of any of them.

 Her previous owners didn't have any cat trees and declawed her, so she never really learned how to climb up and is generally afraid of most cat trees. However, she will jump up on wider, more stable surfaces, like from a chair to my desk.

Are there any good pet structures that are stable and easy to climb up, like stairs or something. It breaks my heart when she can't look out the window.",aeroplanessky,2022-11-03,12:50:13,2022,11,3,12,50,Thursday

I found must of the tail on the ground but saw something red in her mouth that I assume was part of it. I opened up her mouth but she had swallowed and was licking her lips at that point.

Tuesday afternoon she passes two normal poops, however she hasn’t pooped since then. She’s acting relatively normal otherwise - active playing, eating, drinking, and peeing.

1,CatAdvice,My cat is dead set on scratching a very specific area of my carpet,"I am really struggling and frustrated. My one year old cat peed in a corner of my bedroom. I took him to the vet and they said it was behavioral. I did everything the vet suggested except put him on Prozac because that sounded extreme and he hasn’t peed again since I added a third litter box.

I put the third litter box on top of the spot where he peed just to be extra safe. Then he decided it was his life’s mission to destroy the carpet to the left of the litter box. Now he’s clawing at the litter liner in the box and destroying it, and scratching my closet door like crazy like he wants to get in. Not to mention getting litter everywhere and still determined to scratch the carpet in that area.

He has several options for scratching (a post and corrugated cardboard toys)

1,CatAdvice,constipated cat help,"my cat is 11 and has been struggling with constipation for about 2 weeks now. We took her to the vet and they gave us appetite stimulant and laxatives, and said otherwise her bloodwork came back normal. We've tried switching her previously dry-only food to wet food and she had been eating that for a few days, but now refuses no matter what and will only eat the dry food she's used to. She was lethargic for a few days until she passed two huge poops on Saturday and Sunday, but hasn't gone since. I'm just wondering if the process of switching foods plus constipation should be taking this long to recover? Along with everything mentioned above her behavior still hasn't returned to normal. She can get herself to the food/water dish but is slow to do so, she still gets time outside and walks around a bit and still wants to be pet and purrs, but hasn't been sleeping in her bed with me like normal.

My cats have both always been super affectionate towards me. We moved twice since we've been together; they were still both affectionate, but upon moving to the apartment we're in now, Kankuro won't even let me pet him. He slinks under my hands when I try to stroke him, jerks his head away when I go to scratch his head, and won't rub against me unless he's hungry and it's almost feeding time. My boyfriend, however, gets the affection I used to get from Kankuro. He'll lay on my boyfriends stomach and nudge his phone out of his hands to get him to pet him. I *crave* that. Gaara is still so sweet and constantly meowing at me and let's me pet him freely, but I don't know what happened with Kankuro.

1,CatAdvice,sad about my cat's personality not being what i expected,"about 3 months ago I adopted a 3 year old female cat. I was looking for an affectionate lap cat to keep me company because I just moved 20 hours away from everyone I know. I asked the people at the shelter to direct me to their cuddliest  adult lap cat and they pointed me to her. when I met her, she had a URI and wasn't as snuggly as they said, but they said it was because she was sick. so I took her home anyway hoping to give her a safe place to heal up where she could be snuggled as much as she wanted. the first 2 weeks she was home were the snuggliest she's ever been, and since she's recovered she is far more active and far less cuddly than I was lead to believe. I hoped it would improve with more time to bond, and she does show me a lot that she likes me- purring, bringing me toys, blinking at me, sleeping belly up near me, etc. but no cuddling- she meows all the time and is constantly asking to play with me and no matter how much I play with her it never seems to be enough. I just feel sad because she is so bossy that I feel more lonely when I look at her, even though she is a good cat and doesn't do much wrong really. I have always loved cats so much and I was so excited to get her because she is my first ever cat and I've wanted one my whole life- but I get more snuggles from the street cat that lives outside my apartment complex than her despite that being the one criteria I went to the shelter with. I don't really know what to do and I feel really guilty about it. how do I come to terms with the fact that I don't have the cat I hoped for?",Unusual_Duck6444,2022-11-03,09:22:07,2022,11,3,9,22,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,New kitten beating up resident cat PLEASE HELP,I’m in desperate need of help I’ve had my baby angel for 4 years now since she was a kitten so she is about 4 years old. Angel is a female cat. When I had her I already had a cat who was 14 who has since passed so she’s been around cats before. In late august my husband and I adopted a kitten we named max. He is a male. He was a baby when we got him. We did our best to introduce them slowly but admittedly we could have done a better job and we might have rushed the process/forced them too much. Max had always tried to play with angel since the beginning and they did a little but max is bigger now about 6 months or so and he constant harasses angel. Angel had never even hissed not once before max now it’s constant hissing and growling. He terrorizes her.. always jumping on her and aggravating her. I’m not sure if he’s trying to play or just being a jerk. But she is a different cat now. She always jumps up to hide on the chair under our table and seems to be scared to interact and play. If she gets up to walk there he is jumping on her. He always gets on top of her. She’s like twice his size too and won’t defend herself. She literally can’t get a break he terrorizes her all day. I spray him and yell but idk what to do.we don’t want to give max away but we can’t have angel being constantly attacked. Please help!  Also both cats are spayed and neutered.

1,CatAdvice,cat fighting with new cat,"Ive had my orange male (i think partly maine coon) cat since he was 1 and hes now 7. Hes both an indoor/outdoor cat he comes and goes as he pleases but we try to keep him in at night. 

Yesterday we got a new grey female tabby cat who is 6.
(Both cats have been fixed for a while) 

Previous owners said she was very cuddly and a strictly indoor cat. So far she spent the entire first day hiding behind the couch and all of today hiding under my bed. Shes slowly adjusting and has eaten and drank but hasnt used to the litter box yet. 

Initially i thought my male cat was going to do well with her because he just seemed curious and like he wanted to smell her. I thought he could benefit from having another cat around since he gets really lonely when everyone is out for work/school.

But today when she finally got comfortable enough to walk around a bit my male cat came over and started making strange noises at her (they were kind of neutral not good or bad) and then gently hit her in the face (didnt swipe but still made contact) and she ran back to hide. 

And then when she left the room i followed her carefully to make sure hed treat her well and he started doing the same thing he does when he stalks his prey and continued making neutral noises, so i shooed him away before he could bother her and when i picked him up he started hissing at me which is unusual for him. 

Considering its only the second night and she hasnt used the litter yet i wanted to make sure he wouldnt bother her while i was sleeping so i closed him in the bathroom with a blanket to lay on and some food/water. He'll get let out by a roommate when he goes off to work in the very early hours of the morning. 


QUESTIONS: 

I need some advice on what to do. 
Is this behavior actually aggressive since he didnt hiss at her just me and didnt swat? 

She isn't starting anything, shes extremely docile and runs away from him when he does this. 

Is it the right thing to do to seperate them for now? 

If it is aggression how can i help them coexist without conflict? 

Also i assume her not using the litter is because of the stress of a new home but if anyone has advice its very appreciated!",njjyssrhjkydse,2022-11-03,08:02:45,2022,11,3,8,2,Thursday
1,CatAdvice,My cat hates Zoom Groom but it's the only thing that works. Help?!,"Hi everyone!

My cat is a 2-year-old DSH with the thickest undercoat I've ever seen on a shorthair. She sheds like crazy whenever I pet her, which is not a huge deal for me but I really worry about her getting big hairballs when she grooms herself. Since regular brushing with a ""classic"" brush didn't do the trick, I tried a Furminator deshedder, which has done miracles to keep the shedding at bay. She tolerates it very well and even enjoys the grooming sessions with the deshedder, however I've noticed it was giving her dry skin and a bit of dandruff so I decided to stop and try using the Kong Zoom Groom brush. Honestly, it's amazing... it takes care of SO MUCH loose undercoat and it's very delicate on her skin so she's stopped having any dandruff issues however I think my cat hates it. We used to have nice regular grooming sessions where she would come on my lap, get brushed, cuddled and purr up a storm. Now whenever the ZoomGroom's out she doesn't want to be groomed and the only way I can get her to take it is either if I hold her still (very light pressure, so it doesn't take her v long to squirm away, which is the point) or if I start using a different brush and then switch it up in the middle, but that also doesn't last long before she's off my lap. I don't want her to feel uncomfortable or have an unpleasant sensation, at the same time I don't really want to go back to using the Furminator if it's going to give her dandruff.

Anyone have any suggestion on how to proceed? Alternatively, any rec for a deshedder that's also delicate on the skin?

I feel like a terrible pet wonder because my family and I are at work or school all day everyday and we never have time to play with her anymore either. She starting to seem very restless and I’m afraid she’s gonna start to resent me or something. Her little meows sound so sad.

They haven't lived there in a little over a year, but before that, they lived there with a cat for just shy of a year. Today, they took the cat there to introduce it to their parent's new cat. Unfortunately, the new cat became very territorial, as to be expected, and tried to pick a fight with my friend's cat. She just got really scared and hid in a bedroom. My friend put the other cat in the basement so that their cat could calm down, and then went outside. 

Their cat used to spend hours exploring the backyard at this house every day when my friend used to live there with her, but today, because she was afraid of the new cat in the home, she bolted. The neighborhood is a growing new housing development, so the backyard is massive and kind of forested. There is a little mini-forest thing that runs the length of the neighborhood in the backyard, with trees and a creek that runs through the middle. My friend's cat ran deep into that forested brush and they haven't seen her since. They said it looked like she was stopping to sniff things, but wouldn't let my friend get close enough to catch her again.

It's been about nearly 6 hours and she still hasn't come back. My friend tried walking through the brush and calling for her, but after walking the length of 3 yards, they couldn't find her. They have put out wet food, her favorite dry food and treats, and some of her things (a tunnel, scratching boards, toys, litter box, etc.) out in the yard so that it smells more like her territory than the new cat's.

Does anyone have ANY suggestions at all about what else they can do to find their cat? I'm posting this while they sit outside calling for her. This cat means the world to them, and all they want is for her to be safe.

Please do not lecture myself/my friend in the comments about your opinions of cats being outside, or what my friend should have done differently to avoid this. Unfortunately, what has happened has happened and having hindsight won't do any good right now. I'm just trying to help them find their kitty as soon as possible.",QuippleX,2022-11-03,07:30:41,2022,11,3,7,30,Thursday
1,CatAdvice,"Possible stray, need advice for checking he has a home","There’s a cat that hangs out near where I work

He’s polite and friendly so I’m certain he has had a house at some point but I don’t believe he does anymore. 
I’ve seen him first thing in the morning and last thing at night, in all weathers. I saw him sleeping in the rain last week. I’ve seen him hunting mice and getting fed by passers by, and he’s got into my place of work a few times. 

Management don’t like him hanging around but he is encouraged by other businesses near us who do sometimes give him food. 

I plan to take a carrier into work so I can get him to a vets to check if he is chipped. I’m also planning on hopefully getting some posters printed of him to check if anyone knows where he lives.

1,CatAdvice,Cat is afraid of bowl with motion activated lid,"I bought my a cat a bowl with a motion activated lid after problems with the smell and bugs. It’s been a week now but she’s only approached the plate once (that I’ve seen, it’s possible she does when I’m not around). 

Whenever she meows for food I have to pick her up and put her in front of the plate. When the lid opens she freaks out and tries to run away and I have to hold her down so she can smell the food and eat before the lid closes. Once she smells the food, she starts eating. 

I know it’s still early days, but what can I do to help her get over the fear? I assumed once she realised the lid opening = food she would stop being scared but I may have overestimated her lol",i-love-coco,2022-11-03,06:44:42,2022,11,3,6,44,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,PICA cat is nearing my breaking point.,"Hi all,

I have self-diagnosed my 1.5 year old scottish fold with pica. What started as minor cable biting and chewing turned into blankets, clothes, plastics, and paintings being bitten and eaten by my cat. I have tried all solutions that I've found online such as

* Switching his diet to more nutritional, organic foods
* Increased play time and stimulation 
* Removing all objects in sight

His most recent episode was him consuming 5 inches of my sweater off of me while I was asleep two nights ago. I've monitored him since and he has shown signs of decreased appetite and energy which I can only assume will lead to an intestinal blockage as this is the not the first thing he's consumed. I'm taking him to the vet today but wanted to gather some input from anyone who may have experienced this. I recently adopted him in August, and from what I understood he did not get along with other cats in his previous home and was originally purchased from a breeder. From day 1 he was biting cables at my home to which I wrote off as kitten behavior, but later this did not seem to be the case. I love him a lot and do not want to think about having to rehome him, but I know this is not something I can handle in the long term (how to cat proof a home, uncertainty of improvement, vet costs). Any input/thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: 1.5 year old scottish fold has a bad case of PICA to which I am bringing him to the vet today. Unsure of how to go forward with this and if there will even be a certainty of improvement.",mossymoss422624,2022-11-03,05:15:46,2022,11,3,5,15,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,My cat takes me on walks! But does not return if I do not stay with him,"I've got an awesome cat, he is between 2 and 3 years old. I let him go outside to do his business when he asks which is around 3 times a week. 

However, almost every week one of these 3 times he will remain in front of the door outside and keep on making noises until I join him on the walk. Once outside we will walk around as if he was a dog. We go to the construction field where he toilets in the sand, he climbs some trees  and we explore the neighborhood together. This in itself I already find pretty amazing, pretty cool cat behavior!  

After an hour or so, I get tired and start heading home. he still follows me around on the way home but gets more and more distracted until at a point I just push on home without further waiting. This is how it goes most of the days.

But then I have noticed a strange pattern. Whenever he goes outside on his own he always returns home in the morning to eat BUT whenever we walk together and I leave him 'in the wild' he does not return. Instead I need to go out the next day (evening) and get him in one of the spots not far from where I left him.

Does anyone have an explanation for this? I am afraid that he thinks that I dumped him and he is not welcome home anymore perhaps? Or am I just anthropomorphizing this cats behavior? 

If you have experience with walking cats (without a leash) I would love to hear about it as well.",puppetmstr,2022-11-03,05:07:28,2022,11,3,5,7,Thursday

My cat Zuby is coming up on 7 months old, and I've had her since she was two weeks old. She was found stray, and I was able to get her back to health, get all her vaccinations, and get her spayed.

She's a surprisingly adaptive cat. She actually enjoys car rides, and I was able to switch her food type with little to no protest. She's currently an indoor/outdoor cat, good at using the cat door, and she enjoys going on walks and hikes off-leash, as she stays close to me quite well.

1,CatAdvice,Spaying female kitten that’s in heat…,"Hi, so I have a 6 month old female kitten and she’s booked into be spayed on Friday. However, she is now showing signs of being in heat. Very vocal, rubbing on everything, affectionate and assuming the mating position. Definitely in heat. Two q’s:

1- I’ve googled, and word on the internet is that cats can still be spayed while they’re in heat but it’s not advisable. I’m going to ring my vet tomorrow to see what they say, but has anyone gone ahead with this? How was it? I’m concerned if I cancel this appointment I won’t be able to get another one before her next heat cycle (which will be in three weeks?)

2- Should I keep her away from her brother from the same litter? He’s been neutered already and looks a bit embarrassed by her affection for him. Will he try anything on even if he’s been neutered? I kind of don’t want to split them up because they really love each other and she seems to get separation anxiety when she can’t find him round the house. But also don’t want them bonking…

1,CatAdvice,Cat Fears Me Loves SO,"So we picked up our cat over a year ago from a shelter. We've loved him everyday and I played with him occasionally.

&amp;#x200B;

Though, seemingly randomly, he started to fear my very presence while still giving my SO all the love in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Only things I could consider for him to fear me would be that I've had to use a small squirt gun to stop him from knocking paintings off from above the bed or objects off our nightstand when he's desperately trying to gain affection at 2-4am. This could happen multiple times a night. If he'd just non-stop whine my SO or I would place him in the bathroom with all his food and essentials. Another possibility is I move a lot in my sleep, did I move too much and make him upset?

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to slowly approach him, give him treats, give him cat nip, played with him using a laser pointer.

&amp;#x200B;

However, if I go for pets, he'll slink away in what seems like disgust or avoid it all together. If I even walk in his direction he'll flee to a hole under our bed's foundation that he made(which I intend to seal off)

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, when my SO comes home he comes running and is very talkative to be loved. Let's them hold him. Can even snuggle with him in bed. He'll sleep in the bed all night and when they go to work he'll hide away in his hole.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to at least get back to the point that I can pet him without him fearing me?",Cunnilingusmon,2022-11-03,03:29:58,2022,11,3,3,29,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,Which kitten should I adopt?,"Hi guys. I’m completely against buying cats and have been looking to adopt a kitten for the past month or so. I have visited 2 rescuers and after spending around 2 hours with each, both their kittens were comfortable with me and now I’m stuck with deciding which kitten to adopt.

While both are girls, one is a 2-month old Arabian Mau that looks like a Bengal, and the other is a 2.5-3 month mix of Turkish Angora and Arabian Mau (rescuer said this kitty will grow into a medium-haired cat, her tail is fluffy already). Both are rescues who were abandoned and are healthy. Personally, breed or looks aren’t really important to me.

I can only adopt 1 kitten. While money isn’t too much of an issue, I can say for sure that we can comfortably afford premium care and resources for 1 kitten. Will definitely neuter and vaccinate.

I just need some help to understand how do I decide on which kitten to adopt. Should their breed or age affect my decision? Any important pointers to consider? Please ask me questions that are important which I may not have mentioned in this post

Background: 

We’re a family of 5, will become first time cat owners. I’ve had good experiences with cats my whole life. My neighbors and friends have cats who are comfortable with my family and I and our neighbor’s cat hangs out at our apartment as well. Now is the right time to adopt a kitten since my younger brothers are grown up and I will be home full-time studying for the next 9-10 months. After that when I get a job, the cat will be home alone for a maximum of 4-5 hrs during daytime 4 days a week, before any family member is back home.",ChaiBoiAnk,2022-11-03,03:18:44,2022,11,3,3,18,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,I can't keep up with my cat.,"My mom had found a stray cat outside her office building back in January and I had offered to take him in (I've been wanting a second cat for a while. so this presented itself as a good opportunity). He's now just about 1 year old and I'm honestly not sure how much more I can take. 

His major behavioral concerns are nagging (bites and scratches either on me or objects in my house, constant meowing and the likes) and his bottomless pit of energy. I'm a full-time college student as well as working a hefty amount of the week, so I have virtually no time to dedicate meaninfully to my cats.

Most recently, starting about month ago, he's upgraded to waking me up in the middle of the night, typically around 2-4am or will constantly bother me if I happen to wake up on my own (which won't stop until I cave and feed him early). His normal feeding schedule is 2 cans of wet cat food a day- morning at around 7-9am and evening around 4-6pm.

So far I've tried playing with him to get his energy out anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour before bed, covering/removing items that he might chew (and he will typically find another), and giving him dry food through an automatic feeder a few times in the night. His litter box is in my room and there's not enough space in the bathroom to put it in there.

I love this cat so much but unless I can find a solution to this I don't know if I'll be able to keep him. I don't want to give him up to a shelter either.

1,CatAdvice,New &amp; resident kitten playing too aggressively,"Hi everyone, I have a 6 month old kitten who I’ve had about 3 months now, he’s 7lbs. He was well socialized with other cats and dogs before I got him and LOVES to play. The problem is that he had a very very high prey drive and will go too far sometimes once he’s “in the zone”, which can include accidentally scratching me or climbing furniture / curtains appropriately. I’ve been working on this by screaming to let him know when he’s too rough. And have installed cat trees and shelves for him to climb and satisfy his primal urge.

I recently got a second kitten who is much smaller than I anticipated he would be. He is 3.5 months but only about 2 lbs, he was the runt of his litter and has been here about a week and a half. I’ve followed all recommended protocols in introducing the two kittens slowly and they do seem to really like each other and both really want to play / be around each other. They can co-exist in the same room without any hissing or signs of fear, will eat together and fondly sniff each other / share bowls and litter boxes. But due to the huge size difference in the kittens, I’m super afraid the smaller one will get hurt when they’re playing and I’ve been breaking up all of their play very quickly.

When they play, the bigger kitten is always the one holding him down and will repeatedly bite him in different areas and sometimes rabbit kick him. He will hold him down a very long time unless I break them up, which I do.

What can I do to train the bigger one to be more gentle? Am I going to have to wait months for the smaller one to catch up in size? He hasn’t been hurt and doesn’t even cry when the body slams happen, and will even run back to try to play again. So I don’t think the situation is too dire, in the sense there isn’t intentional aggression. But for safety reasons, they can’t be in the same room unsupervised. 

I know kitten play can look worse than it is but I’ve heard too many horror stories about kittens being critically hurt by resident cats. Please please help!!",happyendingtonight,2022-11-03,00:52:40,2022,11,3,0,52,Thursday

I thought about doing the orange/lemon peel trick that I've seen mentioned but not sure if that would actually work since the spray didn't help. 

Has anyone had any success with automatic sprayers? I saw Jackson Galaxy mention one that blows out puffs of air, so I thought about getting something like that that shoots out air or ultrasonic sounds to deter her when we aren't around to stop her, but don't want to spend the money if they won't work. 

I also thought about getting a catmas tree to direct her to it when we can catch her in the tree, but we live in a townhome and don't really have the room for one.

Any and all advice is appreciated!",LimitedEditionDCT,2022-11-03,00:20:52,2022,11,3,0,20,Thursday

1,CatAdvice,"Need to rehome my cat, is there anything I could do to make it easier for her?","(Initially posted in r/cats but I added some info)

We've had her since she was a few months old, and it's now been almost 8 years. A friend's family is taking her in but I'm worried she'll develop abandonment issues or something, is there anything I could do to prevent that?

Would visiting help her? Or would it make her feel worse? Is there anything I should keep in mind? Should I visit her weekly, or only a few times a month? Should it be after a few weeks so she can get used to my friend's home and their family?

I'm sad I have to give her away, but a family member developed allergies. I just hope I can make it easier for her, she doesn't deserve this. 

Nothing can be done for the allergies (we've tried for the past year), and at this point, it's literally the only thing we can do. I just want to know if I could make it easier for her after she's been given away, specifically with the visiting part.

Thank you in advance.",lumoonii,2022-11-02,23:20:41,2022,11,2,23,20,Wednesday
1,CatAdvice,When to accept two cats will never get along…,"I have 2 cats, my male is 2 years old and I raised him from 5 weeks old when he was abandoned by his mom. Ash has an anxious personality, doesn’t like to be picked up, hasn’t been around other cats. My boyfriend and I adopted a female in April 2022, she is 3 years old, friendly, allows us to pick her up and is mischievous. 

We we were told female got along with other cats but Female bullies the male to put it simple, we have to keep them separated b/c we aren’t literally following her around distracting her with toys or treats she will pounce on the Male and a fight** ensues. 

**the weird thing about the fights is the Female never hisses or growls but the Male freaks out and rolls over, is very loud, and I think he gets aggressive out of fear which switches it from play fight to real fight. **

We followed the Jackson Galaxy method to introduce them, give them play and treats when they are together (fully supervised), use feliway diffusers, and I always use positive behavior reinforcement and redirection when needed. 

If I bring them together when they’re both sleepy/ napping the female will calmly groom the male (this very clearly makes him nervous so I don’t do it a lot).

Everyone has said it takes a long time for cats to get used to each other but I’m worried that this isn’t a fruitless effort on my end. They for sure get along better now than in the beginning but is this the best it is going to get? If so I will just accept that they will be separated for ever because I love them both with all of my heart and I can’t give either one up. 

Also I am on mobile so I apologize for formatting issues.",mdabz495,2022-11-02,23:20:06,2022,11,2,23,20,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,"I need help, first time cat owner, cat will not let me sleep.","I have a 18 month old tabby, who is my baby. I love him to death and he is my best friend. 

We’ve been having an issue for about 10 months; he wakes me up between 3 and 5 times per night, every single night. Last night for example:

Bed at 10:30p

He woke me up at:
12:03
1:07
1:52
3:04 (I broke down and fed him here)
5:27

My alarm goes off at 6:30


Now here’s what I’ve tried. This issue is not resolved over weekends when I can spent in excess of 2+ hours of running around playing with him during midafternoon or before bed. Feeding him, likewise right before laying down, has no effect. Leaving my bedroom door open, inviting him to sleep with me, has no effect. 

I attribute the issue primarily to food, and it’s my fault for creating a system where he wakes me up and then I feed him in the middle of the night. His typical feeding schedule is:

1. Usually between 2:00am and 5:00am when I get woken up,

2. 6:00pm when I get home. 

I’ve checked with his vet, who I respect greatly, and she assures me he is eating enough.  

He has multiple options for sleeping which include enclosed spaces with heating pads, ledges off the ground, toys that he can play with, access to a litter box and water (he does not have the ability to graze on food as he only eats wet food). 

Typically my end all solution is shutting a divider door that keeps him in the living room and prevents him from accessing the back of my apartment, which causes me anxiety all day because he spent all night alone, then I go to work and he’s alone all day. 

A popular solution I often hear is getting a second cat, so he has a friend. I can’t help but believe I’m just doing to be doubling my issue as is. 

Please help, my personal health is suffering.",aisjdudnejayah12,2022-11-02,22:16:47,2022,11,2,22,16,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,Peeing Out of Box,"Curious to know if anyone has experience something similar. For the record I did take my cat to the Vet yesterday. 

Last Thursday my cat peed on the bathroom floor. She has never done this, I've never had any box issues with her. She did poop a few minutes before and her electric box hadn't started it's cycle, she left the bathroom, then came back in and peed in the corner right in front of me. I just assumed it was because her box hadn't raked through yet. I got home Monday night and she had peed on the bathroom rug, different spot. She has been acting normal, eating and drinking well and she is a decent water drinker. No changes in my life or routine. She has still been trotting around, playful and has stuck to her routine. 

I took her to the Vet yesterday to see if she had a UTI. The Vet didn't think it was a UTI, he decided to put her on some Gabapentin for 7 days to see if that would calm her down or ease stress she might be feeling. She does have Conjunctivitis, we started drops yesterday. I guess it's possible that her eye could be stressing her out. I did notice her eye seemed a little irritated early last week but didn't think much of it. 

She was really mopey last night which I think was just from the visit to the Vet, she also got two shots while there. This morning she was back to normal and continued on with her morning routine.

1,CatAdvice,Need advice about a wild cat,"My parents have a cat as well as a semi-wild cat they’ve been feeding for around 5 years (it’s very friendly but has no interest in coming in the house) 

But about a year ago a very old looking cat started living and taking shelter at the end of the garden fairly far from the other 2 cats. My parents didn’t pay much attention to it until this summer when we had a long and harsh heat wave and my mum started giving it water, and then food because she felt bad for it. Soon after, another very similar looking young cat started coming, we think maybe an offspring. They tolerate each other, though the young one comes off a bit of a bully to the old one, the old cat wouldn’t get any food if we didn’t end up starting to feed both. They are definitely wild with no owners. 

My dad is getting fed up and doesn’t want to feed 4 cats. He’s willing to keep feeding the old cat as there’s not much he can do or go, but my mum can’t handle feeding one of them and not the other, so my dad wants to take the young one to a cat rescue shelter.

1,CatAdvice,Is it cruel to leave a cat for 10 upto 16 hrs in a room?,"At the moment I’m away from home 10 upto 16 hrs/day. Which means my cat Loke is locked into a room because he started to mark the apartment and we have wood floors. So as a way to prevent him to do accidents while I’m not home, I lock him into one of our rooms that don’t have wood floor. 

I’m hoping the neutering will help him to stop marking the apartment. Loke is a stray that have been with me for over a month. The first 3 weeks he was perfect but when he started to feel better and the stress of the last vet visit he started to urinate on all my clean laundry, beds and couches. At least he always poop in the litter box. Next week he will be neutered. 

When I’m home, he’s always allowed to be in the whole apartment and I miss being able to have him up in my bed. Before he would tell us if the bathroom door was close and he would hold himself. The vet said there was nothing wrong with him. So there no health cause for him peeing everywhere.

I’m hoping he will stop urinating after the neuter, so that he can be back to free access of the apartment.",Crazy_bunnymom,2022-11-02,19:50:18,2022,11,2,19,50,Wednesday

For a feral cat that used to run out of my backyard from just making eye contact with me, she makes no fuss about being picked up or carried; no scratching, meowing or jumping whatsoever.

1,CatAdvice,cat struggling with recent housing change 😞,"Hello,

My poor 4-year-old cat and I are struggling badly with our recent move. He has gained several pounds in a month and is displaying new destructive, anxious behaviors like clawing at wood bed frame/biting me to get attention. Overall, I can just tell the move is taking a toll on him. He doesn't snuggle much anymore and his mood seems way off. 

To outline - He was given to me as an outdoor kitten and was able to roam outdoors at my last three residences. 

Unfortunately, due to a variety of factors, I recently had to downsize from a 1 BR apartment where it was relatively safe for him to go outside into a 3 BR apartment with two roommates and a small Corgi where it really is not safe for him to go outside. 

I did the safe-room transition over two weeks and he slowly moved into the rest of the apartment once he got bored of my room. However, all he basically wants to do is eat. Even if I only feed him at the same time each day, he scarfs it all at once, then sits by the bowl and cries, scratches my bed frame or bites me until I refill his food bowl. 

Since I now only have my small bedroom to myself, this means any time I go into my room for any reason he sprints to the food bowl and cries. If I ignore him, he gets frustrated and either takes it out on me or an item he knows will get my attention (bed frame or dresser). 

He has a large climbing and scratching tree that I've jammed into my small room because I knew he'd need a post/item for engagement, but he no longer feels comfortable climbing on it. I'm not sure if this is due to his weight, my room's small space or if he's simply aged out of the toy. 

I've tried feeding him with huntable rat toys that contain food, but they do not fix his expectation that any time I enter my room he should be getting food in his bowl. I haven't found a place to feed him in the shared spaces of the apartment because the Corgi keeps finding a way to eat his food. 

Additionally, while the Corgi is friendly and they're coexisting well, the Corgi injects himself into any playtime (swinging a feather, laser pointer) which discourages my cat from playing. Attempting to lock up the Corgi makes him feel left out, causing him to howl from behind the door and freak out my cat. 

I'm very worried for my cat 😞 I'm a long way from home in a big city with sky-high rents and didn't have any other options for where to live after the end of my long-term relationship. 

I don't want him to become obese but I can't stop him from demanding food and I can't ignore him because he's destroying one of the few valuable things I own in my bed frame. I also don't want to give him away cause he's my lil partna and he's been one of the few steady aspects of my life over the last few years.",ButchMFJones,2022-11-02,18:42:18,2022,11,2,18,42,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,Fasting before surgery,"My cat (female, ~6 mo) is supposed to go to the vet for spay surgery at 9AM, in around 3 hours (drop off in 3 hours, not sure when she will actually go into surgery, since it is at a low cost clinic where they do 10+ pets/TNRs in a single day). 

Now, they require that all animals are fasted at 10PM the night before. Which I did, removed all food and water at 10PM. However her sister and her managed to get ahold of the bag of kibble at around 4:30AM. I didn’t actually see her eating, but found her grooming her face right next to the bag and the bag had a big enough opening. 

I’ve been waiting for 2 months for this appointment but I’m obviously OK with postponing if I know this will create a risk.

My partner and I rescued a kitten around 2 months ago. She is around 6 months now and is behaving completely bad. We try to do long play sessions, but nothing seems to be enough. 

She has now spilled two cups containing liquid to my devices. Yesterday she even broke a TV when trying to reach some shelves. 

When she is tired she just go to sleep (all the afternoon), but from the moment we wake up she is with the zoomies, scratching everything and just being bad. She is always meowing for attention and for play. She has a cat tree, another scratching pole, a lot of balls and some plushies to play on. Also a toy for entertainment, which has a ball inside it and she can play and try to pull off. 

I think is only the teenager phase because she is not yet spayed, but we both work (from home) in the morning and is difficult to keep her entertained meanwhile. This is creating a lot of anxiety to the point we are considering giving her to someone else. 

Do you have some advice on how to handle these type of cats? Do you know if this is only related to her being super young and teenager? Any advice is welcome, we are desperate and this is causing a lot of problems.",Lamiroirr,2022-11-02,17:26:26,2022,11,2,17,26,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,End of my tether and really needing advice with cat who needs lots of stimuli but is too aggressive to go outside,"My cat is nearly 2, and I live w/ her in a one bedroom unit. I have a lot of cat enrichment around my apartment (diff places to look out window, diff seats, many toys on rotation) and play with her every day, however the space is small and I am out a lot. She really seems to crave more stimuli, she meows at me constantly when I'm home, even throughout the night. It's impacting my sleep and my mental health, she seems upset/restless and I become guilty and anxious.

For the last few months, I've been letting her roam outside of my unit, in an outdoor area where other neighbours' cats roam. I've realised that she is extremely aggressive, way more so than any of the other cats. She can't seem to handle another cat being so much as within her line of sight without attacking. My neighbours and I ended up creating a buddy system whereby I'd give one of them a text if I wanted to let my cat out (not more than a few times a week) and they would put their cat in and let me know. However, my cat will chase them through open doors, invade their spaces, sit on their windows and cause them a lot of fear/distress. It's made my relationships with my neighbours fraught, which is really upsetting to me, and I've been so nervous and guilty. I've decided I can't let my cat out anymore, but her behaviour when she can't go out is so unsettled and extreme that it makes being at home really hard.

I've got no idea what to do at this point :( I love my cat but this is feeling so difficult. I don't know how to make her stimulated enough so as to not be meowing 24/7.

1,CatAdvice,How to make a “community cat” feel comfortable but not dependent.,"Bear with me while I worry about a neighborhood cat at 2:45 AM. My partner and I moved into his house recently which was previously rented by a tenant. There’s a cat that comes by looking for food – the tenants fed him cat food daily. My partner said that when he bought the house five years ago, he had seen the cat wandering around. His ear is clipped so it looks like the neighborhood is looking after him to some extent.

I feed him bits of turkey, egg or some fish I didn’t finish, but tbh, I’m not interested in buying cat food as a regular household supply. He used to come by sporadically, and I was happy to share our leftovers. The only thing is, it looks like he really loves our house now because he’s sleeping on our porch at night and throughout the day. I feel badly, like I should either feed him regularly or not at all as not to confuse him. 

We can’t house him, and the shelters are totally full and will not take him. He also doesn’t let me pet him. I’m sure with a lot of patience he could belong to someone, he’s just been outdoors for so long.

Winter is coming but we do live in Austin, TX, so right now temps are manageable. I’m not sure what type of a shelter I can make that wouldn’t attract roaches (we have a lot of em here). And, is it okay to feed him even if it isn’t regular, or would that do more harm than good?  I also used to put water down with his food but he never seemed to drink it when I’d spy with the security camera. Do cats need much water?

1,CatAdvice,how to introduce 2 cats,"If you don't want the back story read paragraph 2



So the sweetest stray cat came up to my fiance and i on Halloween. It was a beautiful black cat with yellow eyes. We ended up taking it home to get it out of the cold, and we fell in love. We had him scanned, he isn't chipped. Had a full check up done, he's as healthy as can be. We put out missing cat ads, called local apartment complexes to see if anyone reported a missing cat, nothing. We are thinking of giving him a forever home, but we don't know how to introduce him to our cat, Kevin


Anyways, Our Male cat Kevin currently is free to roam the apartment, and the stray (we chose Binkx as a good temporary/forever name)  is in a cage, fixed up nice so he is comfortable. What is the best way to go about introducing them? Kevin is very scared, but he is slowly getting braver. Binx is very confident, and not afraid of other cats at all. Kevin is neutered, while Binkx is not.

1,CatAdvice,Cat anxious when presenting hands,"Adopted an old cat last week. Been going fine. He's not completely comfortable yet though obviously.  I do try and play with him though. Laser pointer and lure/string on stick.

The one thing that gets me is that when I present my hand to him for a sniff/pet he  gets really anxious and gets spooked. Usually will hiss and then run away.  
For most animals I found that is usually a pretty safe way to introduce yourself but it seems to really upset him.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not so sure how his last owner was with him. When I first met him. He came right up and rubbed his face in my hand and I got some pets in. Although he did bat at my hand when I  tried to reach for his head for another pet.

This is going to take some time to build trust.

The hand thing is a bit perplexing though. Maybe he's just confused?

Any insights or advice would be appreciated.

1,CatAdvice,How to keep new kitten off desk?,"How to get new kitten to stay off of desk?

We got a kitten last Friday and she hid under the bed for the first 3 days before suddenly turning into a love bug and is all over us when I come in there to visit. She still hides when she gets spooked but overall she's out and about in the room. I love it but only one problem, my mom works in that room and when she's in there the kitten absolutely HAS to be on the desk demanding pets. 

She tried moving her cat tree close for her to sit next to her but nope straight onto her desk. She tried picking her legs up so the kitten can't climb up them, she just jumps up. Tried repeatedly just putting her back on the ground to no avail. She'd be fine with her in her lap but she doesn't want to stay there she wants to walk back and forth on the desk for pets. She's too small to give free reign of the house, and it'd be a bit too scary for her since her safe room in that bedroom and when my mom works it has to be closed.

We've been working on introductions the past few days to the current cat. Mostly they consist of the kitten ignoring current cat and wondering or purring loud af and trying to get close to current cat. Current cat just watches from afar, doesn't hiss or smack or arch but will walk away when she comes near.

Tonight we resorted to letting the current cat into the room to distract the kitten so my mom could get work done. I would take her out into the living room and watch her but I've got two dogs and haven't done the introductions much with them, they've done visual introductions but haven't gotten anywhere near where she is introduction wise with current cat.

Please how do we keep her off the desk while my mom's working? I love her loving nature but this is a tad much 😅",Sorrelfur,2022-11-02,12:16:40,2022,11,2,12,16,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,Advice/help: Cat Scratches My Face Unpredictably,"This has been the strangest (and most stressful) pet-related issue I've had to figure out. I've had cats my whole life, but I've never experienced this. My 1.8 year old, female/spayed cat keeps unpredictably scratching me in the face. It only happens when she's in my lap. She will be snuggled up in my lap and then leap at my face claws out. Sometimes I catch her eye right before she does it and her face looks focused, maybe playful? There's no growling or hissing. She's been doing this since I got her as a kitten. I've tried different strategies. At first, I thought it would happen because I had stopped petting her and she wanted to get my attention. To address that, if she crawled into my lap, I would pet her and then set her down once I was done. But then, it started also happening when I was petting her. So, I thought maybe she's getting overstimulated by petting. So, I wouldn't pet her when she was in my lap. But nothing has worked except just not allowing her to get into my lap, which seems sad because other than this one thing, she loves to cuddle and is very snuggly. She is always seeking out my lap. But...today, she scratched my face and drew a little blood for the first time and I'm just beside myself trying to figure this out. I've tried to research this specific behavior and I can't find anything. Has anyone experienced this before? Any advice? I'm all for trying something new.",newtles21,2022-11-02,11:53:00,2022,11,2,11,53,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,My kitten won’t stop attacking with my new cat,"To give some background I live in a 1 bedroom 1 bathroom apt, it is fairly small. I adopted my kitten Al, at 10 weeks old from a friend, he was taken from his litter too early somewhere between 2-5 weeks old, and has never lived with a cat until now. When I got him 4 weeks ago, he was extremely playful and comfortable with me from the start, comes up to me for cuddles and is very sweet when he is tuckered out. When he is full of energy he would always run around and stalk me and bite my hand, and when I researched why, I found out he might need a friend. I chose to adopt a 10 month old female kitten who was raised perfectly fine with other cats. They got along and were able to eat in the same room within 3 days and slept next to each other being completely comfortable. 

Al always wants to play with her and tackle and do all the fun kitten activities he missed out on, but my new female cat does not want to play very often. He will pounce on her out of nowhere and keep trying to play with her and she will growl and hiss and gently fight back. She will eventually try to run away but he doesn’t let her. She gets even louder with the hissing and growling and that’s when I put Al into his carrier. I’m never worried about them hurting each other, they never have drawn blood, fur, and never made that traditional cat fight sound. Based on their body language, the female cat generally wants nothing to do with it, but he thinks it is all play. 
How do I get this to stop? Both are fixed. He won’t play with me or toys anymore. I just want my female cat to not have to be so annoyed all the time. They both are so sweet when calmed down. If Al doesn’t stop I will probably rehome him for another home that fits his temperament, which is worst case scenario. Thank you for reading:).",ufaiw,2022-11-02,11:17:27,2022,11,2,11,17,Wednesday

Her name is Opie.  I got her when she was 9 weeks old and she is now almost 6 months old.  She is an angel.  Follows me from room to room, cuddles me all the time, and gets sad/cries when I’m not in her line of vision (I know separation anxiety is unhealthy but I’m home 90% of the time so I can see how she has gotten used to having me readily available).  

I know it seems pathetic, but between my mental health and physical health issues I don’t have a lot going for me or a lot of reliable friends, so I get worried she will stop showing her love for me as much as she does now and I’ll be sad.  I know it’s natural for cats to become more independent as they age but I can’t help but want her to be my clingy baby angel forever. 

At what age do kittens usually stop being so clingy?  I have two other cats, but one was already an adult when I got her from the street, and the other has been 30% cuddles/70% aloof since she was a kitten.  

I’m so scared she’s going to stop needing me and outwardly showing love for me.  Yes, I know I’m codependent AF and yes, I’m in therapy.

1,CatAdvice,Cat suddenly more vocal at night - food/weather related?,"Our cat use to have this schedule of eating a meal at 4-5am (automatic feeder) then plays by itself for a while. She’ll stay in the living room. We live in a one bedroom apartment.

Over the last 2 nights, our cat started meowing on and off after she ate at 4am - short meows mixed with sad meows. She’d meow, comes into the bedroom to meow some more, then go back out and play. This morning she’s abnormally active after eating breakfast at 9am, keeps meowing and playing with toys when she usually goes to sleep.

We think the cause could be either: 

1) There is a typhoon going on and the wind sounds were pretty loud, so kitty might be scared? But she wasn’t looking out of the window, not hiding or displaying fearful body language.

2) We tried a new wet food 2 days ago - Wellness pate. Kitty has been eating brands mainly of Ziwipeak and Feline Natural with minimal ingredients. Wellness isn’t bad but there are more addictives and supplements in the ingredients. Could this cause kitty to act weird, like how food addictives make kids hyperactive?

Other than these there isn’t much change. Our cat eats, drinks and uses the litter box normally. Gets pets and playtime everyday. We’d like her to go back to her usual quietness at night!",CauseSpecialist9576,2022-11-02,09:46:19,2022,11,2,9,46,Wednesday

1,CatAdvice,Diabetic cat is very difficult at feeding time,"My girlfriend and I have two cats, Zero and Crona, they're both 8 years old and brothers.  
[Here's a picture of them!](https://i.imgur.com/11NQ8og.jpeg)  
Back in March Crona was diagnosed with diabetes and we went through the process of monitoring his blood glucose levels over several months. Our vet recommended a specific canned wet food diet for him that he's been eating for 8 months now. He said Crona has to eat the entire can in one sitting, one in the morning, and one in the evening, and then be administered 2 units of insulin. (After doing some research it sounds like cats have small stomachs and tend to eat a little at a time? It seems odd our vets advice is to make him eat it all at once.) Feeding him has become, to put it mildly, incredibly frustrating and time consuming for both of us.  


Zero and Crona had been free fed for 7 years but we switched to set meal times when our vet recommended it (before the diagnosis, they were both a little heavy). It was an adjustment met with lots of screaming and whining but they eventually got used to it. At the time they were both eating Purina Beyond Indoor cat food so it was easy enough to fill their bowls and walk away; they'd finish their food eventually. After Crona's diagnosis and switching him to the canned food we realized that if we left the room, he would eat 1/4 of the food and walk away to lounge somewhere else. It would take hours for him to go back and finish it, which wasn't compatible with what the vet told us. One can of food, 2 units of insulin. Sometimes we would leave and walk back into the kitchen to see Crona eating from Zero's bowl, so we couldn't leave Crona in the kitchen with it out. One of us literally has to stand next to Crona for the entire time he eats, encouraging him and directing him back when he tries to walk away. If we're lucky, this will take 25 minutes with only minor encouragement. Most days it's more like 45 minutes. Some days it's over an hour and a half, where he'll eat half and sit there staring off into space, and after trying to motivate him to eat he'll just plop on the ground onto his side. We have to do this twice a day so on an especially bad day, it's three hours of trying to get Crona to eat. We love him, but it's become a massive burden.  


So I want to ask if anyone else has a diabetic cat they've had a similar experience with and if they have any advice on how to deal with this. Some days we barely have time for any self care, and with both of us working full time, this creates a lot of welled up stress. If this is just what we have to do then so be it, we love our beetus boy and we'll do what we have to do for him, but I can't pretend that it isn't negatively impacting our lives.",BonemanJones,2022-11-02,07:28:43,2022,11,2,7,28,Wednesday
